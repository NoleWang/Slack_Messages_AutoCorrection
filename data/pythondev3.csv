1,2017-06-16T10:51:34.290598,Melvin,Is it possible to switch between conda and virtualenv? That is I want to switch the actual environment managers not just environments in them … I typically use conda but want to try something out that requires virtual env and is not compatible with conda.  Thanks.
1,2017-06-16T10:55:34.384740,Beula,"What is it that ""requires virtualenv"", most things I know don't require anything other than an interpreter and dependencies"
1,2017-06-16T11:05:27.626658,Melvin,<@Beula> zappa …. at least if you don’t want to mess with the zappa-conda fork.
1,2017-06-16T11:12:26.790435,Johana,i don’t see why you couldn’t use a virtualenv for virtualenv things and conda for conda things. the issue is when you try to mix them together but as long as you’re pointed at the right python interpreter things should work.
1,2017-06-16T11:12:47.798620,Johana,what have you tried so far?
1,2017-06-16T11:12:55.802001,Melvin,Ok. So … I’m not sure how to ‘point’ it at the right thing … not even sure where to start.
1,2017-06-16T11:13:25.813347,Melvin,Just switch the path/env settings?
1,2017-06-16T11:13:25.813670,Johana,with virtualenv you activate the environment and it does a lot of handy little things for you like setting the python python.
1,2017-06-16T11:13:37.818110,Johana,so you activate the virtualenv when you want to use zappa.
1,2017-06-16T11:14:49.846808,Johana,`source /venv-name/bin/activate` should do it
1,2017-06-16T11:15:22.859984,Johana,are you using python 2 or python 3?
1,2017-06-16T11:16:05.876875,Hillary,"Conda does the same really, so ```conda create envname``` gives you a conda environment"
1,2017-06-16T11:16:23.884079,Hillary,and then ```source activate envname``` sets it up
1,2017-06-16T11:16:50.894537,Hillary,you can use ```which python``` to check which one you are using
1,2017-06-16T11:17:14.903791,Johana,"but i think the issue is with the library <@Hillary>, :re <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1497625527626658>"
1,2017-06-16T11:17:15.903816,Melvin,3 … and (maybe this is just a dumb question) but I was worried that installing using conda to install virtual env is not what I wanted.
1,2017-06-16T11:17:17.904817,Hillary,"but as <@Johana> said, probably best to not try and mix them up"
1,2017-06-16T11:17:58.920546,Hillary,"Oh, hadn't seen zappa before"
1,2017-06-16T11:21:00.991498,Johana,when you do `which python` what comes up?
1,2017-06-16T11:21:14.996747,Melvin,Normally the conda one.
1,2017-06-16T11:22:13.019636,Johana,"that’s where we would run into our first issue. we wouldn’t want to be using the conda one. we would want something like the system python, i believe."
1,2017-06-16T11:22:27.025256,Melvin,Right… thus my question :slightly_smiling_face:
1,2017-06-16T11:23:08.040418,Melvin,Seems like I need to be able to deactivate conda and ‘activate’ python3 (sytem would be python2) and then use virtual env.  Thanks for getting me started on the right track.
1,2017-06-16T11:23:40.053156,Hillary,"when you create the environment, you can specify something like: ``` virtualenv envname --python='path/to/python'```"
1,2017-06-16T11:23:54.058494,Hillary,if that helps
1,2017-06-16T11:24:54.081996,Melvin,"Yes, thanks <@Hillary>"
1,2017-06-16T11:25:24.093955,Hillary,then follow <@Johana> advice on activating
1,2017-06-16T11:25:54.105805,Melvin,conda sets the path to point to its bin directory … so I may need a way to not do that when trying to do virtualenv/zapp stuff … before I can activate the zappa env (if I understand this correctly).
1,2017-06-16T11:32:17.257230,Hillary,related to this? <https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/issues/167>
1,2017-06-16T11:34:07.300432,Melvin,Yes. I just wanted to explore Zappa without having any conda/virtualenv issues. Don’t need conda for this so wanted to switch to using virtualenv and wasn’t sure how to do it. I think I have a strategy now.  Thanks everyone.

2,2017-06-16T12:44:59.833887,Johana,haha.. cool :thumbsup:
2,2017-06-16T12:45:38.847124,Rona,anything on your end
2,2017-06-16T12:46:16.859718,Johana,same old stuff for the most part. i’m just trying to achieve perfect work/life ~balance~ harmony. lol
2,2017-06-16T12:46:47.870159,Rona,me to
2,2017-06-16T12:46:56.873056,Rona,I am like 75% coding
2,2017-06-16T12:47:06.876465,Rona,if not 10 % of no coding is spent thinking of coding
2,2017-06-16T12:47:09.877535,Rona,the rest is sleep
2,2017-06-16T12:47:14.879053,Rona,and some netlfix
2,2017-06-16T12:47:26.883061,Rona,75% of coding is doing work coding
2,2017-06-16T12:47:35.886153,Johana,that’s good.
2,2017-06-16T12:47:36.886671,Rona,I should say 50% coding 15 % work none coding
2,2017-06-16T12:47:42.888337,Johana,python or .net?
2,2017-06-16T12:47:49.890778,Rona,.net
2,2017-06-16T12:47:52.891794,Rona,but some python also
2,2017-06-16T12:47:55.892872,Johana,or both
2,2017-06-16T12:47:59.893935,Rona,I just love both
2,2017-06-16T12:47:59.894139,Johana,you try some iron python?
2,2017-06-16T12:48:05.896004,Rona,I want to
2,2017-06-16T12:48:16.899562,Johana,you doing C# or VB?
2,2017-06-16T12:48:19.900657,Rona,I want to try WPF in iron python
2,2017-06-16T12:48:23.902048,Rona,even if I have no need
2,2017-06-16T12:48:27.903129,Rona,powershell and c#
2,2017-06-16T12:48:33.905267,Johana,cool
2,2017-06-16T12:48:34.905377,Rona,vb hell no
2,2017-06-16T12:48:40.907563,Johana,lol
2,2017-06-16T12:49:55.932568,Johana,i agree there. i tried to do iron python LONG time ago. i was a dba but the dev was a C# guy and he was said to have been the best in the university. the university was doing consolidation at the system level so he applied to work at our little lab basically to hide.
2,2017-06-16T12:50:16.939273,Johana,i tried to take the opportunity to learn what i could but he ended up not being able to do much coding.
2,2017-06-16T12:50:19.940685,Rona,anyone who uses macs
2,2017-06-16T12:50:21.941436,Rona,this is good <https://monodraw.helftone.com/>
2,2017-06-16T12:50:48.950486,Rona,oh wow
2,2017-06-16T12:51:12.958439,Johana,haha that’s interesting.

4,2017-06-16T13:17:38.502015,Suellen,So you *were* snooping on our private conversation? :flushed:

4,2017-06-16T13:21:16.574927,Suellen,Alright.
4,2017-06-16T13:21:29.579089,Suellen,Not that I say anything bad.

5,2017-06-16T14:30:08.992420,Suellen,hey buddy
5,2017-06-16T14:30:11.993368,Johnathon,"I have installed a python package with pip, made some changes on the source code, recompiled it with `python -m compileall .` but when I run package_name -arguments my changes weren't applied"

5,2017-06-16T14:31:30.020883,Johnathon,yeah I did this at `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mypackage`
5,2017-06-16T14:31:34.022229,Suellen,oh
5,2017-06-16T14:31:45.025657,Johnathon,I also removed the previous .pyc file
5,2017-06-16T14:31:53.028688,Johnathon,before recompiling
5,2017-06-16T14:39:36.181847,Johnathon,"apologies if I'm asking in the wrong channel, I didn't find one for pip issues"
5,2017-06-16T14:40:26.198233,Johana,help is a good channel to ask in n/w.
5,2017-06-16T14:44:34.280101,Johana,did you install your package with `-e`?
5,2017-06-16T14:44:51.285770,Johana,"`pip install -e ""path/to/package""`"
5,2017-06-16T14:47:46.343855,Johnathon,<@Johana> no
5,2017-06-16T14:48:11.352214,Johnathon,just `pip install mypackage`
5,2017-06-16T14:48:13.352834,Johana,that would be your issue
5,2017-06-16T14:48:19.355109,Johana,-e allows it to be editable
5,2017-06-16T14:48:55.367115,Johana,it creates symlinks to where your package exists to the site-packages dir so that you can edit the files and see the changes.
5,2017-06-16T14:49:12.372421,Johnathon,hmm
5,2017-06-16T14:49:15.373394,Johnathon,so I need to reinstall it
5,2017-06-16T14:49:59.388056,Johana,you can install it again on top (i think).
5,2017-06-16T14:50:12.392440,Johana,but it’s probably safer to uninstall first
5,2017-06-16T14:50:24.396579,Johnathon,okay
5,2017-06-16T14:53:25.456731,Johnathon,"`mypackage should either be a path to a local project or a VCS url beginning with svn+, git+, hg+, or bzr+`"
5,2017-06-16T14:53:44.462885,Johana,is it local?
5,2017-06-16T14:54:20.475203,Johnathon,no
5,2017-06-16T14:55:28.497320,Johana,hmmm.. this package is on pypi?
5,2017-06-16T14:55:50.504637,Johana,you’re going to want a local copy of whatever package this is. if you are editing it and expecting to see the changes.
5,2017-06-16T14:57:31.538030,Johana,"for example lets say this is my project dir.

```
|--- requests
|--- my_awesome_app
```"
5,2017-06-16T14:58:07.550251,Johana,these are two python packages. requests has been cloned down from github but i would like to edit it separately and see the changes in `my_awesome_app`
5,2017-06-16T14:58:29.557761,Johana,i would go into the `my_awesome_app` dir and activate the virtualenv.
5,2017-06-16T14:58:48.564247,Johana,"then type `pip install -e ""../requests""`"
5,2017-06-16T15:00:14.594016,Johnathon,virtualenv?
5,2017-06-16T15:00:41.604200,Johnathon,uuuh let me see if I can figure something out by cloning the repo
5,2017-06-16T15:02:43.644995,Johana,"yes, a virtualenv is short for “virtual environment” it basically makes a copy of your python binaries and places them in a separate location (again using symlinks). This separate location acts as an isolated environment in which you install dependencies/packages. What you gain from this is the ability to only have the packages and package versions you need for that particular project."
5,2017-06-16T15:03:49.666411,Johana,if you are using python3 it comes with virtualenv capabillity
5,2017-06-16T15:04:40.683049,Johnathon,does `pip install` look for any particular file?
5,2017-06-16T15:04:56.687729,Johana,pip install will be looking for a `setup.py` file in the root of the package.
5,2017-06-16T15:05:12.692882,Johnathon,great
5,2017-06-16T15:05:15.693595,Johnathon,I think I got this
5,2017-06-16T15:05:51.705221,Johana,:thumbsup:
5,2017-06-16T15:06:58.726057,Johana,"it takes a bit to get used to. virtualenvs, pip, and so forth but once you get the process down it will be second nature."
5,2017-06-16T15:07:31.736467,Johana,and once you start working with multiple projects with different requirements/dependencies and even python versions you’ll see why this extra stuff exists.
5,2017-06-16T15:08:36.755996,Johnathon,hey it worked!
5,2017-06-16T15:08:39.757023,Johana,the important thing is to try and start using these practices early on so that they become habit as they are typically used by python developers.
5,2017-06-16T15:26:53.079587,Johnathon,it actually really works!
5,2017-06-16T15:27:14.085581,Johnathon,this is going to be my first pull request
5,2017-06-16T15:27:18.086938,Johnathon,thank you so much <@Johana>

Page not found (404) Request Method: GET Request URL: .... Using the URLconf defined in EMC_site.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order: $queue_system/ $admin/ The empty path didn't match any of these. You're seeing this error because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings file. Change that to False, and Django will display a standard 404 page.
but it WAS JUST WORKING. I didn't change any code just came home from school. I found that the interpreter was no longer set to python 3.6, it wasn't set to anything so I'm wondering if other things may have changed? Thanks for any help! I'm hoping it is a commonly known problem if something is just working and then starts to give you this error if you come one and off wifi or something. Another one of my projects happens to be having the same problem. I also tried typing /admin or /queue_system after the web address too. Neither worked."

10,2017-06-17T12:04:17.464628,Staci,"How would I go about it, if he insists?"
10,2017-06-17T12:04:46.466559,Staci,I thought you'd run into the same issue as having a workbook open by two different people at the same time
10,2017-06-17T12:10:17.488424,Winnifred,"<@Staci>, I think it’s possible with A LOT of work. I don’t know if there are libraries in Python that actually allow you to open and edit without saving a new version. You can copy an existing workbook, make changes and save that one over the old one."

10,2017-06-17T12:13:25.500774,Winnifred,"<@Staci>, if you’re still keen ~to~ on trying, the best library i’ve seen so far for pretty formatting/excel writing is <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/>"
10,2017-06-17T12:14:50.506276,Suellen,"Actually, I remember pywin32 can do stuff with Excel documents."
10,2017-06-17T12:15:11.507883,Suellen,And bonus: you *can* access already opened documents
10,2017-06-17T12:15:17.508270,Suellen,But that's crazy of course.
10,2017-06-17T12:16:42.513838,Staci,"Yea, I've worked with excel before, but never on an open document."
10,2017-06-17T23:39:00.611201,Alvin,<@Staci> I have done something similar by feeding the worksheet live data and cells update automatically as new data comes in. But I used excel dev tools. I dont think one can edit an open excel sheet otherwise.
10,2017-06-18T01:38:14.880624,Marcie,yeah the only real live option is to write some awful VBA glue in the excel to speak to something external via python
10,2017-06-18T01:39:44.883388,Marcie,it's my eternal hope that they at least put in some sort of c# or powershell automation into excel at some point but I've been hoping for like 10 years now :(
10,2017-06-18T06:11:04.503479,Meg,<@Winnifred> not exactly.  xlsxwriter is only for creating and writing to excel files.  It can't open and read from existing files
10,2017-06-18T06:11:47.505301,Meg,right there at the top of the FAQ <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/faq.html>
10,2017-06-18T06:12:15.506366,Meg,"&gt;&gt;&gt;Can XlsxWriter use an existing Excel file as a template?
No.

XlsxWriter is designed only as a file writer. It cannot read or modify an existing Excel file."
11,2017-06-18T03:09:16.067893,Hermina,"hi folks, i got trouble while trying pandas, how to slice a dataframe using  Int64Index?
I’m search an index base on value ```id = df.loc[df['time'] ==1496587067]``` Then I got an `Index` object `id`, I want to get 10 elms before that index. Which way I should go?"

13,2017-06-18T09:07:50.962804,Thomasina,"before a user account can be created in my app it checks whether someone with the same username exists, and then whether someone with the same email has already registered, as both of these are supposed to be unique. Do I really need to check these individually? I know the insert query will fail if the values aren't unique since the columns are set to `unique`, but is there a way to know _which_ one caused the error, so that for example I can tell the user whether their username is taken or whether their email address is already registered."
13,2017-06-18T09:13:02.978147,See,<@Thomasina> your DB will throw an Integrity error with the name of the field in the message. So you can probably parse that one to find out. It could be easier if you are using some ORM but I am not sure.
14,2017-06-18T09:25:14.012824,Mirna,"<@Hermina> Hi. How about this snippet:
```
import pandas as pd

l_num = [num for num in range(10)]

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'num': l_num
}, columns=['num'])

l_id = df.loc[df['num'] == 5]
first_match_id = l_id.index.get_values()[0]
print(df[first_match_id - 5:first_match_id])
```"
14,2017-06-18T09:51:30.089911,Hermina,"Thanks, I thought there will be a shorter way rather than get the Int index, and slice it with int type :slightly_smiling_face:"
14,2017-06-18T10:02:55.127199,Mirna,Base on your conditional. It may has many matches id. So i think this maybe the shortest way :slightly_smiling_face:.
14,2017-06-18T11:30:07.422501,Winnifred,"<@Meg> yep, agreed. I mentioned open and edit wasn’t possible in my first comment (at least with the popular python excel libs)."

Anyone have an idea?"
17,2017-06-18T19:38:36.088133,Marcie,<@Rolf> did you mean like chaining methods?
17,2017-06-18T19:38:45.088736,Rolf,Yes.
17,2017-06-18T19:39:29.091438,Rolf,I've looked into @property methods @staticmethods

17,2017-06-18T19:40:13.093959,Marcie,`@staticmethod` just means a function doesn't require an instance of itself to operate on
17,2017-06-18T19:40:35.095376,Marcie,the key to chaining methods is that you have to return a copy of `self` on chainable methods
17,2017-06-18T19:41:33.098660,Rolf,What do you mean
17,2017-06-18T19:42:37.102285,Marcie,"```

- if `template1` is `Main` and its length &lt; 10, take `template1`, otherwise take `template2` and check its length and if thats too long, take `template3` (each string can be dynamic, so that sometimes `Main` is shorter and sometimes the last. but it should always start by checking `Main`)"

22,2017-06-19T12:08:17.183560,Beula,The short of it is this: `os.system` does not capture the stdout from the subprocess - you need to use the `subprocess` module: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor>

27,2017-06-19T16:27:59.825530,Lucilla,anyone worked with PyMC?
28,2017-06-19T16:31:11.892227,Meghan,"So, I broke our mysql cluster, how's everyone else's day going?"
28,2017-06-19T16:31:22.896169,Meghan,Apparently a query caused a table to lock and never unlock.
28,2017-06-19T16:32:07.911742,Beula,We had that during a deploy once <@Meghan> - someone's console had a lock on a table during a deploy and it got stuck.
28,2017-06-19T16:32:32.920192,Beula,"You may ask ""why does someone have production access to have a console open"" - but that's beside the point :joy:"
28,2017-06-19T16:33:15.934791,Meghan,"With the data we are working with, it wouldn't surprise me if we ended up doing that."
28,2017-06-19T16:33:34.940900,Meghan,We have weekly cron jobs that truncate then insert hundreds of thousands of records.
28,2017-06-19T16:35:16.975250,Meghan,"Unfortunately, much of the data we are working with isn't indexed when we get the data."
28,2017-06-19T16:35:41.984268,Beula,"Dang, that is a bit of data."
28,2017-06-19T16:38:30.042304,Meghan,"Would be nice to index it, but then those bulk inserts become insert or updates and would likely take a long time."
28,2017-06-19T16:39:27.061620,Beula,Was the fix pretty difficult today?
28,2017-06-19T16:39:42.066582,Meghan,"Don't think he has it fixed yet. Thankfully, not my baby."
28,2017-06-19T17:12:35.724418,Beula,"Any reason to roll your own test framework? It looks like one big issue is that you don't handle exceptions in the runner, so cleanup won't be guaranteed"
28,2017-06-19T20:04:53.931470,Noemi,"<@Beula> I handle exceptions in the real code, they are included in the ""do some stuff, execute the actual test"" comment. In any event, I thought it made sense to execute the tests this way, and I have a Jenkins job that that does so by executing main.py (each test case being called from within the main file). Really I'm just curious if that goes against any conventions or industry practices because I want to correct any bad habits. I don't really have a reason for rolling my own framework other than to get better at coding (this is my first coding job)."
28,2017-06-19T20:06:16.944144,Beula,"I'd say that, from experience, don't ever roll your own at work. That's free time stuff until you find a deficiency in community accepted frameworks (unittest or pytest, in the python world for the big couple). Every time I have rolled my own it has bitten me hard."
28,2017-06-19T20:16:28.034983,Beula,"<@Yessenia> - the `illegal byte sequence` is from stderr of the subprocess, one of the pipes is getting something it can't handle. From the try local it's the `cut -c30`."
28,2017-06-19T20:18:02.048628,Beula,"If you know you don't want whatever is from that, you can just use `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` and it will be captured (and not printed to the python console). Since from the console you will get bytes back, you'll need to decode and probably strip them"
28,2017-06-19T20:22:35.087395,Noemi,Are there any that you recommend for UI testing?
29,2017-06-19T17:26:06.962261,Thelma,has anyone used pyflot? how is compared to bokeh?
30,2017-06-19T19:48:01.768547,Ouida,"Can anyone explain why this works?
```
with open(path, 'rb') as file_:
        for chunk in iter(lambda: file_.read(4096), b""""):
            hash_obj.update(chunk)
```
Specifically the `b""""`?"
30,2017-06-19T20:01:06.895198,Beula,"<@Ouida> the docs for `iter` explain it pretty well (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter>).

The second argument is a ""sentinel"" value, which will create the stop condition when the result of the callable (the lambda function) equals that value"
30,2017-06-19T20:03:18.916710,Beula,"So each iteration it will check the result of the lambda against that value, if they're equal it raises `StopIteration`, a special built in exception to exit a loop."
30,2017-06-19T20:18:23.051963,Ouida,"<@Beula> sure, but what is `b`? it’s not an identifier?"
30,2017-06-19T20:18:48.055466,Beula,`b''` is a bytes object
30,2017-06-19T20:19:06.058048,Ouida,ohh
30,2017-06-19T20:19:25.061120,Ouida,okay yeah that makes sense… ha
30,2017-06-19T20:19:42.063604,Beula,"You have a few of those: `r''` -&gt; raw, `b''` -&gt; bytes, `f''` -&gt; f (format)-string"
30,2017-06-19T20:21:46.080860,Ouida,so `b''` is basically an empty byte object?
30,2017-06-19T20:23:33.095434,Beula,Pretty much
30,2017-06-19T20:24:34.103682,Beula,I use pytest for everything

33,2017-06-20T10:28:51.472542,Beula,Do you control the client code for this? Looks like the timestamp offset is the wrong format for `%z`. `+01:00` should be `+0100` iirc for that one

35,2017-06-20T15:20:09.561662,Britta,"sorry, ok :slightly_smiling_face:"
35,2017-06-20T16:58:06.658897,Patty,One thing you're doing is changing the value of `post.image` each iteration of that loop
35,2017-06-20T17:00:28.710541,Patty,Is it `pass`ing each loop? Do any of those keys exist in `request.files`?
35,2017-06-20T17:05:05.807608,Patty,<@Britta> ^
35,2017-06-20T17:17:14.044706,Mariano,you can add those file fields on your form <@Britta>. Then you can pas the `request.FILES` to the form constructor and it handles that for you.
36,2017-06-20T17:51:17.644296,Temika,Anyone know if this is the right shorthand for a one liner? `featured_image=(n == selectedImageIndex)`
36,2017-06-20T17:51:29.647606,Temika,"n is from `enumerate` and would be `0` `1` `2`, etc. `selectedImageIndex` would be `1` in this case."
36,2017-06-20T17:51:42.651158,Temika,Python doesn’t moan but it doesn’t seem to be working
36,2017-06-20T18:01:08.805842,Annalee,"Ok, cool. 
I’m trying to learn more about `super()`

Here’s a code snippet I’ve written:
```
class MyList(list):
    def __len__(self):
        print(""calculating the total number of items in the list"")
        super(MyList, self).__len__()
```
And when I instantiate `MyList` I get the following error:
`TypeError: an integer is required`

what am I doing wrong?"
37,2017-06-20T17:59:34.778671,Annalee,Is this the right channel to post novice Python questions?
37,2017-06-20T17:59:43.781371,Temika,Sure
37,2017-06-20T18:04:29.858089,Suellen,"- `super(MyList, self).__len__()`"
37,2017-06-20T18:04:34.859461,Suellen,"+ `return super(MyList, self).__len__()`"
37,2017-06-20T18:05:07.867790,Suellen,"actually, what Python version are you targeting?"
37,2017-06-20T18:05:42.876732,Suellen,`return super().__len__()` is much nicer :slightly_smiling_face:
37,2017-06-20T18:06:03.881929,Temika,Instantiating in Python 3 with that code would be fine I think? But trying to do `x = MyList()` `x.len()` would return `AttributeError: 'MyList' object has no attribute 'len'`
37,2017-06-20T18:06:20.886147,Annalee,I’m using Python 2.7.x
37,2017-06-20T18:06:31.889176,Suellen,"... come to think of it, if you don't do any processing at all, you can just skip this method"
37,2017-06-20T18:06:44.892362,Suellen,"if you don't implement it yourself, an original one will be used from `list`"
37,2017-06-20T18:07:23.902061,Annalee,well I’m just practicing with `super`. Let’s say I want to log or print before `__len()__` is executed
37,2017-06-20T18:08:19.915939,Annalee,ok why do I have to use `return`?
37,2017-06-20T18:10:03.941253,Temika,You’re saying return the result of my parent classes `len` method.
37,2017-06-20T18:11:41.964742,Annalee,"ok so I did this as well but no return was necessary:
```
class MyDict(dict):
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        print(""adding key: {} and value: {}"".format(key, value))
        super(MyDict, self).__setitem__(key, value)

    def __getattr__(self, key):
        if key not in self:
            return 'key not recognized'
        else:
            return self[key]

```"
37,2017-06-20T18:12:18.973465,Suellen,`setitem` doesn't return anything useful
37,2017-06-20T18:12:29.976064,Suellen,and there is a return statement in your `getattr` :))
37,2017-06-20T18:15:32.019286,Annalee,ah I see
38,2017-06-20T18:26:48.172952,Simon,What is the best way to convert a list to a dict? The only thing is I want to specify my keys from outside the list. So the list is basically the values of the dict and I will provide the keys separately.
38,2017-06-20T18:27:49.186401,Suellen,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; values = ['one', 'two', 'three']
&gt;&gt;&gt; keys = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = dict(zip(keys, values))
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{1: 'one', 2: 'two', 3: 'three'}
```"
38,2017-06-20T18:30:31.222201,Simon,Perfect exactly what I was looking for.
39,2017-06-21T00:03:17.142439,Blossom,"Hey guys, I'm new to deploying django applications and I've been fighting an issue for two days now, could anyone help me with this? <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44666555/django-wsgi-no-module-named-site> I just posted a question in stack overflow and I'm completely stuck at the moment"
39,2017-06-21T00:04:46.153047,Beula,"<@Blossom> I think you have a type-o in your question:

```
activate_this = os.path.join( PROJECT_DIR, 'env/shinra/bin', 'activate_this.py'$
```

The `$` is invalid and would cause a syntax error"
39,2017-06-21T00:05:57.161985,Blossom,"oh yeah let me edit that, thanks!"
39,2017-06-21T00:06:20.164867,Beula,"Otherwise, some questions:

1. Where are you running the `python3 -i ...wsgi.py` command from? The app may not be in your PYTHONPATH
2. Why are you not using  uwsgi or gunicorn to serve the app, vs trying to run it directly?"
39,2017-06-21T00:07:29.173192,Blossom,ive tried running it from both /var/www/shinra/ and var/www/shinra/shinra
39,2017-06-21T00:08:19.179039,Blossom,I ran it with uwsgi and gunicorn both and was able to get them both to serve the app (without the static files) but I was never able to configure either apache or nginx correctly for my EC2 instance
39,2017-06-21T00:08:34.180925,Blossom,And the tutorials to configure either of those are old
39,2017-06-21T00:14:12.219848,Beula,"If you're at all familiar with ansible, here is how I have my recent Django app served from gunicorn "
39,2017-06-21T00:14:15.220278,Beula,<https://github.com/mrasband/ansible/blob/master/ottter.yml>
39,2017-06-21T00:16:37.236044,Blossom,"Oh no idea, but the line exec_start seems to be what I ran when I tried with gunicorn and that worked perfectly so being able to run that as a bash or something would be great"
39,2017-06-21T00:17:11.239657,Blossom,"My question there would be, is it ok to run the gunicorn command to start serving the app, store that command to run on server start and just use nginx to feed my static files?"
39,2017-06-21T00:17:59.245220,Blossom,"But now that I remember I couldn't do both at the same time, I could only run gunicorn when nginx was stopped and viceversa"
39,2017-06-21T00:21:23.268844,Blossom,I'll do everything again from scratch and see if I manage to work around it now with gunicorn and nginx
39,2017-06-21T00:26:18.301718,Beula,"Sounds like you're competing for ports and running into collisions. Nginx should handle 443 and 80, and forward to the ""upstream"" port (if using gunicorn) used by gunicorn (the `-b` flag can set this)"
39,2017-06-21T00:27:23.308714,Beula,With Django it's also pretty much required to use nginx (or another webserver) to serve the static files (created via `./manage.py collectstatic`)
39,2017-06-21T00:31:28.336652,Blossom,"yeah I thought as much, so I began from scratch and was able to put my app up using `gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 shinra.wsgi`"
39,2017-06-21T00:32:09.341443,Blossom,"now, having that, do you have any resource I could use (that could work with either 1.10 or 1.11 and python 3) for setting that up with nginx?"
39,2017-06-21T00:46:41.439287,Blossom,ah.. here is where I got stuck
39,2017-06-21T00:46:42.439413,Blossom,<https://pastebin.com/r8MrQAPi>
39,2017-06-21T00:46:52.440501,Blossom,"Thats my bash script, I never got it to work haha"
39,2017-06-21T01:12:42.620460,Blossom,Does anyone know how make gunicorn use the python from my virtual environment? for example: `/home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/gunicorn -c /home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/python /home/ubuntu/shinra/scripts/gunicorn_config.py shinra.wsgi`
39,2017-06-21T01:13:55.628069,Blossom,running `/home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/gunicorn -c /home/ubuntu/shinra/scripts/gunicorn_config.py shinra.wsgi` only works inside my virtual env and not with supervisor
39,2017-06-21T01:24:12.697071,Blossom,"never mind, I got it to work now, my directories were all wrong"
39,2017-06-21T07:23:40.291050,Cristine,If this data is going to be used in a form that you post the json some where look at might help <https://github.com/kushalpandya/JSONify>
40,2017-06-21T07:23:42.291368,Clarence,"Hello, are there open source APIs to access street traffic feed live?"
40,2017-06-21T07:25:50.320087,Vada,<@Clarence> it's more likely that individual cities and towns will be responsible for publishing feeds if they want to
40,2017-06-21T07:25:53.320532,Vada,so no global one
41,2017-06-21T07:54:16.690963,Holli,"Hi guys, im developing an app in React. It has some content that i need to send to a database, not sure how to get it to communicate. I'm using React, Axios, Django. Any examples or things i need to be looking at?"
41,2017-06-21T07:58:08.744474,Meg,I'd suggest `django-rest-framework` for django. Will make the API construction easier
41,2017-06-21T07:58:47.753372,Holli,<@Meg> so using a simple ajax request using axios or jquery i can post my contents over this API to the database?
41,2017-06-21T07:58:50.754053,Meg,"and if you're not doing so, use `create-react-app` to get a good project boilerplate with a very high quality webpack configuration"
41,2017-06-21T07:59:26.762347,Meg,"so, what happens is when you wire up `axios` in your react app, it creates a request to the server via GET, PUT, POST, etc"
41,2017-06-21T07:59:59.769616,Meg,"and while you can think of this as similar to jquery's `$.ajax()` method, its a little different"
41,2017-06-21T08:00:03.771170,Holli,ok
41,2017-06-21T08:00:11.774002,Meg,have you done anything like this before?
41,2017-06-21T08:00:19.775990,Holli,no thats why im kind of confused
41,2017-06-21T08:00:27.778405,Holli,ive been able to feed data into my react components
41,2017-06-21T08:00:38.781111,Holli,but now posting to the django setup
41,2017-06-21T08:00:45.783011,Holli,its not so clear in my mind
41,2017-06-21T08:00:55.785658,Holli,im going through the DRF tutorial
41,2017-06-21T08:01:17.791153,Holli,"dos my axios post request need to point to a view URL that takes in a post, grabs what i send and stores?"
41,2017-06-21T08:01:22.792508,Meg,correct
41,2017-06-21T08:01:50.799079,Meg,"and if you're using DRF, the URL is mapped to at least an `APIView` implementation"
41,2017-06-21T08:02:34.810096,Meg,"which contains a `get(self, request, ...)` or `post(self, request, ...)` implementation"
41,2017-06-21T08:02:41.811917,Holli,ok
41,2017-06-21T08:03:03.817560,Holli,so all that classic jazz if request.GET
41,2017-06-21T08:03:05.818010,Holli,etc.
41,2017-06-21T08:03:16.820788,Meg,out the window
41,2017-06-21T08:03:38.826127,Holli,"Could you point me to any documentation, guides, tuts that i could look up? i fail to communicate what i am searching on google"
41,2017-06-21T08:03:45.827706,Holli,brings up different stuff
41,2017-06-21T08:04:15.834801,Holli,a simplified example is what i need from somewhere to just establish an easy proof of work
41,2017-06-21T08:04:28.838122,Meg,server side or client side?
41,2017-06-21T08:04:39.840860,Meg,"I mean, the DRF tutorial is pretty good"
41,2017-06-21T08:04:46.842496,Holli,yeh perhaps client sided
41,2017-06-21T08:04:54.844381,Holli,sending the post request to the DRF API
41,2017-06-21T08:04:58.845299,Meg,ah ok
41,2017-06-21T08:04:58.845399,Holli,processing it
41,2017-06-21T08:05:26.852264,Meg,<https://daveceddia.com/ajax-requests-in-react/>
41,2017-06-21T08:05:32.853778,Meg,so that would help client side
41,2017-06-21T08:05:42.855971,Meg,"server side, really depends on _what_ data you're sending"
41,2017-06-21T08:05:51.858231,Meg,and whether you need to seiralize it to a model instance
41,2017-06-21T08:06:05.861701,Holli,yeh i would i'll be sending json to the database
41,2017-06-21T08:06:17.864612,Holli,thanks for the help though
41,2017-06-21T08:06:25.866481,Holli,it confirms im heading in the right direction with DRF
41,2017-06-21T08:06:29.867311,Meg,yeah
41,2017-06-21T08:06:44.870996,Meg,and what makes things easy is it can handle the serialization/deserialization for you
41,2017-06-21T08:06:56.874251,Meg,so you can send in a model representation via json from your client
41,2017-06-21T08:07:17.879131,Meg,and it will deserialize it to a model instance which you can do more stuff with
41,2017-06-21T08:07:33.883134,Meg,"and then sending data back out to the client, it will serialize models to JSON"
41,2017-06-21T08:08:08.891465,Holli,"ok nice, and just ajax post to the url view which receives the data"
41,2017-06-21T08:08:22.894910,Meg,correct
41,2017-06-21T08:08:26.895940,Meg,"or get, put, etc"
41,2017-06-21T08:08:35.897910,Holli,superb thanks man
41,2017-06-21T08:08:40.899155,Meg,:thumbsup:
41,2017-06-21T08:08:51.901851,Holli,:100:
42,2017-06-21T08:05:49.857747,Yessenia,<@Mirna> I am trying to get the value inside the li and strip out some text. I will test your code
42,2017-06-21T08:05:58.859862,Yessenia,<@Mirna> Thanks
43,2017-06-21T08:42:32.433269,Beula,The ansible I linked has a `role/nginx` that has the nginx setup steps :)
44,2017-06-21T09:09:14.933506,Rolland,"I'm evaluating celery/redis alternatives for task queuing and scheduling. Someone mentioned redislite and apscheduler. Does apscheduler do task queuing or just scheduling? Also, any other alternatives?"
44,2017-06-21T09:09:21.936149,Rolland,This is being used for a Django environment.
44,2017-06-21T09:11:14.974243,Collette,`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` is good at queuing when you don't need ETA scheduling
44,2017-06-21T09:15:32.063476,Rolland,"So if I'm just firing off a task (not scheduling), that would be a good way to go?"
44,2017-06-21T09:15:38.065593,Rolland,I like that.
44,2017-06-21T09:18:33.126491,Beula,"Redis-lite would be if you kept celery to make it easier to distribute, otherwise APScheduler could call manage.py commands in your app and be deadsimple"
44,2017-06-21T09:19:58.157093,Rolland,ah. gotcha.
44,2017-06-21T09:21:10.182734,Rolland,"I was looking at if there was maybe en embedded task queue manager, but I'm not coming up with much. APScheduler looks to be a good route."
44,2017-06-21T09:21:42.194462,Rolland,Can you fire off tasks immediately without scheduling them using apscheduler?
44,2017-06-21T09:25:15.271654,Beula,Yeah I think the decorator returns the original function. So you could just call it directly iirc
44,2017-06-21T09:26:10.291856,Beula,"Interesting thought, embedded task queue manager. I think in many cases someone would just use Cron or windows scheduler "
44,2017-06-21T09:29:24.364350,Rolland,True.
44,2017-06-21T09:38:31.575313,Vada,<@Rolland> we're also using huey
44,2017-06-21T09:39:05.587549,Rolland,I was actually just looking at that one. Can you start it right from django?
44,2017-06-21T09:44:28.711939,Suellen,<@Vada> from an author of Peewee?
44,2017-06-21T09:45:53.745451,Vada,<https://github.com/coleifer/huey>
44,2017-06-21T09:46:02.749104,Vada,not sure if they authored peewee but maybe
44,2017-06-21T09:46:10.752285,Vada,And what do you mean by start it from django?
44,2017-06-21T09:46:46.766691,Rolland,"Well, I'd like to not have to run and manage extra processes."
44,2017-06-21T09:47:37.786961,Vada,it will use workers like celery
44,2017-06-21T09:48:11.799955,Rolland,ah. ok.
45,2017-06-21T10:47:35.337872,Romona,"hello everyone, I've requirement where dataset is large like 10 millions records, i want to use django rest framework in order to provide that data.

Question : which one is the best ORM which is efficient for large datasets?

1. Django ORM
2. SQL alchemy

"
45,2017-06-21T10:48:45.369425,Dave,SQLalchemy is more performant especially if you're using Core.
45,2017-06-21T10:49:54.400579,Romona,<@Dave> thanks for the suggestion. I've those data on microsoft SQL server.
45,2017-06-21T10:50:40.421233,Romona,would like to move to postgresql.
45,2017-06-21T10:51:13.435676,Meg,"yeah, will be cheaper in the long run"
45,2017-06-21T10:51:19.438332,Meg,no sql server license :slightly_smiling_face:
45,2017-06-21T10:51:23.440036,Dave,<@Romona> <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/faq/performance.html>
45,2017-06-21T10:52:56.482672,Romona,how about django ORM? Not good from performance point of view?
45,2017-06-21T10:53:00.484897,Johana,if you use sqlalchemy you can reflect your mssql database and then create its exact schema in postgres.
45,2017-06-21T10:53:48.506810,Johana,and you could use sqlacodegen to create the models.
45,2017-06-21T10:54:18.520726,Johana,i've done this very thing to move a .net application to python.
45,2017-06-21T10:54:22.522493,Gabriele,"I think ""performance on large data sets"" and ""ORM"" are mutually exclusive. ORMs exist for development convenience, not high performance."
45,2017-06-21T10:54:29.525442,Meg,^
45,2017-06-21T10:54:42.531611,Meg,"and furthermore, you should use pagination and such to actually retrieve the data"
45,2017-06-21T10:54:45.532959,Gabriele,"That's not to say you _can't_ get good performance - you can, if you know the ORM well and/or you have access to low level commands like SQLAlchemy Core"
45,2017-06-21T10:54:53.536688,Romona,Ultimate plan is this only. Move web API .Net to django API.
45,2017-06-21T10:55:03.541345,Gabriele,"But they're not designed for that purpose, and will probably impede you somewhat"
45,2017-06-21T10:55:21.549778,Meg,and there are times you will have to write and execute raw sql
45,2017-06-21T10:55:23.550854,Johana,sqlalchemy's orm does a pretty good job in general.
45,2017-06-21T10:56:47.589390,Gabriele,"It depends a lot on the nature of the querying. If you have good indexing set up and you're only working with a few records at a time, the ORM usually doesn't care if there are 10, 10000, or 1000000 rows in a DB"
45,2017-06-21T10:57:07.598358,Gabriele,"But if you're doing ""big data"" stuff where you routinely hit large amounts of the table... that's a different matter"
45,2017-06-21T10:57:17.602975,Winnifred,reducing joins helps a lot too
45,2017-06-21T10:57:41.613681,Gabriele,"yup, ORM joins are often nowhere near as efficient as raw SQL joins"
45,2017-06-21T10:58:33.637625,Meg,one thing I like about django is you can print out the sql query for a given db access
45,2017-06-21T10:58:43.641838,Meg,and then look at it to see if you can improve it
45,2017-06-21T10:58:46.643400,Suellen,SQLAlchemy can do this too!
45,2017-06-21T10:59:09.653900,Meg,"by django, I mean the django framework, not the ORM"
45,2017-06-21T10:59:39.668295,Meg,"since it is possible to replace the default ORM with sqlalchemy (though I've never done this), but the API is largely the same"
45,2017-06-21T11:03:16.774301,Johana,"yea, you can mix sqlalchemy and django orm. it's all just python at the end of the day. however, if you swap out one for the other you lose all the benefits of the django orm and how it integrates with the framework."
45,2017-06-21T11:08:04.904795,Dave,"If performance is a factor than use SQLAlchemy core to work on this large data set. If deadlines are more of a factor that use Django ORM since you're already use DRF. Just make sure to use eager loading on relationships where you can to optimize queries.

46,2017-06-21T11:25:24.365386,Willena,any good tutorials you all would recommend on packaging for somebody who's never done it?
46,2017-06-21T12:44:15.347345,Romona,why don't you create store proc?
47,2017-06-21T12:43:10.322890,Norris,how can i do this in python
47,2017-06-21T12:45:16.370807,Norris,how can i do that

52,2017-06-21T17:00:48.142825,Martha,Ah I dealt more so with querying and pulling info on pages
52,2017-06-21T17:00:56.145543,Martha,but what kind of stuff are you wondering about?
52,2017-06-21T17:03:01.189477,Winnifred,efficient ways to grab several thousand records/json arrays
52,2017-06-21T17:05:43.244936,Martha,u can use python with just requests and json thats what I always use
52,2017-06-21T17:05:53.247870,Martha,actually just with requests even
52,2017-06-21T17:06:35.261620,Martha,"`requests.get('url').json()`  you just want to look at their documentation and dig a little to find out how you can make the most requests possible - because some of their apis do allow batching, or multiple queries at one time"
53,2017-06-21T17:20:29.524814,Thelma,hey what is the best way to write a list of json objects to a file
53,2017-06-21T17:21:42.547010,Thelma,I was thinking of writing it into a csv
53,2017-06-21T17:23:33.580689,Thelma,where each row is a basically a json object or should I save it as a json file?
53,2017-06-21T17:24:10.591940,Beula,"<@Thelma> You should probably either do a CSV, which would mean breaking the JSON into columns in your CSV or just a file where each line is a new JSON object"
53,2017-06-21T17:24:25.596665,Beula,"You could make the JSON a column of the CSV, technically, but that would be kind of awkward to use again"
53,2017-06-21T17:24:46.602830,Thelma,yeah that is very awkward and hard to use I am thinking of latter
53,2017-06-21T17:26:36.636405,Beula,Are you going to want to search them for anything? If so - you may be best served to dump the contents into a database so you can query and such
53,2017-06-21T17:27:04.645070,Thelma,yeah right now I just want to work with files and if needed we can move to db
53,2017-06-21T17:27:29.652637,Martha,how big is the file
53,2017-06-21T17:28:31.670855,Thelma,its quite small 1200x250x4 float array is basically what it is
53,2017-06-21T17:28:34.671682,Martha,dump it as json then either transfor in refine in a matter of seconds or drop it on here if its small enough: <https://konklone.io/json/>
53,2017-06-21T17:30:02.698747,Thelma,oh it is better if I automate it I just dumped as a json object
53,2017-06-21T17:30:12.702097,Thelma,thanks  guys!
54,2017-06-21T18:39:57.755010,Thelma,"hey guys I have a quick question 
```
dict = {....}
keys = dict.keys()
values = dict.values()
dict2 = dict(zip(keys,values)
```
will dict and dict2 be the same always?"
54,2017-06-21T19:00:04.993729,Dorothy,"since dictionaries are unordered, I would suspect the output of zip to produce the same results as the original dict, barring mutation of keys or values"
54,2017-06-21T19:00:26.999098,Dorothy,this is my best guess
54,2017-06-21T19:00:57.005877,Dorothy,contents and keys i'm confident in
54,2017-06-21T19:01:12.008878,Dorothy,"ordering, not sure but think they probably will be the same"
54,2017-06-21T19:03:59.042046,Dorothy,I assume that shallow copy or deep copy is not related to your problem
54,2017-06-21T19:10:20.114872,Dorothy,"if uncertain, instead of `dict == dict2` you could ask `all(dict.keys() in dict2)`"
54,2017-06-21T19:57:13.589685,Patty,"Since dictionaries don't keep order like <@Dorothy> said, the calls to `keys` and `values` are not guaranteed to be in the same order (though the resulting lists _do_ maintain their order but are not created in order). Because of that, zipping them back together will not be equal (because keys may have new values and order may not be the same). However if you used an `OrderedDict` then keys and values lists will maintain order, so calling `zip` in that instance would result in the same results "

55,2017-06-21T22:41:59.927540,Winnifred,"hrm, I've never used bottle but it looks like `request` is implicit.  Is it safe for me to assume you want to convert the request to json?"

55,2017-06-21T22:54:23.017420,Winnifred,"Okay, per <https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/api.html#bottle.BaseRequest.json>, it looks like you can only use that method if the content type header is application/json or application/json-rpc. I'm guessing it's not. You can probably see this if you directly print the `request` object. If you still want to force this to json, you can `import json` then use `json.dumps(request)`."

57,2017-06-22T04:36:58.127617,Ciera,so you need to iterate over the list to get each label/value inside

58,2017-06-22T05:56:57.398979,Timothy,"Maybe someone has an idea on a bit of a headscratcher I have.
I have a project which essentially is a python app with currently npyscreen ui running on a raspberry pi. The idea is that a user can search for games using the app on the pi. Wonderful, works well. The issue is that I’m aiming it for RetroPie, where the majority of it’s users only have a controller connected, so no keyboard to enter details. How would I solve this? I was thinking of maybe creating an onscreen keyboard, or perhaps have up and down arrows to go down letters of the alphabet and left and right to move the cursor, but then how do you move to the next input box, or button? Anyone have any ideas?"
58,2017-06-22T05:58:31.423899,Ciera,how many button are there on a controller ?
58,2017-06-22T06:00:34.457854,Timothy,"Well say someone has the bare bones, a NES USB controller, you are looking at 4 buttons and D"
58,2017-06-22T06:00:43.460257,Suellen,This is the best I've seen. Navigating through almost 100 keys using left/right is a pain.
58,2017-06-22T06:03:01.495622,Timothy,"True, but the issue there is that it counts on analog. Many users will have USB retro pads like NES and SNES (myself included) which cannot easily move diagonal let alone hold it there. And the NES USB controller has a total of 4 buttons, with only 2 really free to play with, so that makes this perhaps too difficult"
58,2017-06-22T06:06:30.547314,Ciera,Can you do long press? 
58,2017-06-22T06:09:08.585573,Timothy,I should imagine so yes
58,2017-06-22T09:12:02.179068,Patty,<@Timothy> you could offer two interfaces: one with the controller that is a bit slower for input (maybe also detect NES vs SNES for number of buttons to help us SNES controller users) and another that allows for just using a keyboard as well. i tend to keep a spare logitech wireless keyboard connected to my retropie
58,2017-06-22T09:12:19.184774,Patty,also THANK YOU for adding something that is MUCH NEEDED in emulation station
58,2017-06-22T09:12:27.187394,Patty,<@Timothy> :taco:
58,2017-06-22T10:37:00.201185,Timothy,"<@Patty> you sound like you have the same setup as me, wireless logitech keyboard and snes usb controller. I think that’s probably the way I’m going to do it. Have it determine whether to use keyboard or on screen and then create an onscreen keyboard if it’s a controller."
58,2017-06-22T11:37:51.818831,Meghan,"I guess I'm late to the retropie discussion, but I would aim for as simple as possible. Assume the user an NES control and nothing more, and if possible avoid an onscreen keyboard, because those are always a pain.

I have an HTPC with a logitech keyboard/touchpad that I use in addition to a XB One control, but I would guess this is the exception rather than the norm. And, it's not retropie, so I like being able to use a browser and other things."
59,2017-06-22T09:48:25.974206,Junita,<@Beula> do you think you need the limited liability aspect?  what kind of other ventures are you thinking?

60,2017-06-22T11:41:33.914812,Roseann,Question: How do you create a view with python &amp; django
60,2017-06-22T11:43:09.955372,Dave,You have return as a parameter.
60,2017-06-22T11:43:58.976079,Dave,<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/http/views/>
60,2017-06-22T11:44:00.977168,Roseann,Should it now be a function
60,2017-06-22T11:45:08.006576,Dave,Django has great documentation. The one I sent you is about creating views. Normally you have `request` as a parameter for a view function. This will contain information pertinent to that particular request.
60,2017-06-22T11:45:36.019175,Dave,Returning an HttpResponse is correct though.

61,2017-06-22T14:18:50.640926,Marcela,I might need some help
61,2017-06-22T14:19:14.649678,Marcela,I am trying to use virtualenv to install requirements.txt which required a C++ Microsoft Visual Studio Build tools.
61,2017-06-22T14:19:28.655115,Marcela,"I've installed this and configured PATH, and now when when requirements.txt runs cl.exe it gets this error:"

62,2017-06-22T16:56:45.044589,Beula,Why override the defaults?  You can run `PYTEST_DEBUG=1 python -m pytest` to see the debug
62,2017-06-22T16:58:24.078320,Noemi,What do you mean override the defaults?
62,2017-06-22T16:59:06.092625,Noemi,Running that command gave me a long ugly stack trace
62,2017-06-22T17:03:32.184582,Beula,The `pytest.ini` is just the defaults
62,2017-06-22T17:03:38.186527,Noemi,Yes
62,2017-06-22T17:03:39.187065,Noemi,Well
62,2017-06-22T17:03:40.187290,Beula,but just drop your test functions to be outside the class
62,2017-06-22T17:03:49.190423,Noemi,No dice
62,2017-06-22T17:04:14.198423,Beula,I reproduced it locally and it finds them fine.

62,2017-06-22T17:04:25.202009,Beula,Your class doesn't match the `python_classes` config key
62,2017-06-22T17:04:39.206654,Noemi,That's what I was trying to override with the ini
62,2017-06-22T17:05:06.215457,Noemi,Ahhh
62,2017-06-22T17:05:07.215689,Noemi,I see
62,2017-06-22T17:06:00.232332,Beula,You also need `self` as an arg to class methods (which is how those will be treated)
62,2017-06-22T17:06:58.250884,Noemi,"Ahh, adding self worked"

63,2017-06-22T21:20:03.186723,Marcela,It's been keeping me from making progress
63,2017-06-22T21:26:13.235246,Beula,"<@Marcela> we have a channel dedicated to windows (<#C5XHHMXHB|os_windows>). It's small, but growing. A large portion of the community isn't on windows (or those that are are a bit quieter) - so we are trying to gather that knowledge there."
63,2017-06-22T21:27:02.241860,Beula,Can you list the contents of the `requirements.txt`?
63,2017-06-22T21:27:27.245258,Marcela,Yes
63,2017-06-22T21:27:51.248274,Marcela,and i added that channel
63,2017-06-22T21:28:17.251834,Marcela,I was wondering if maybe I should just install a Ubuntu terminal and use that as my environment? I think I've seen someone do that before but I'm not sure. I would rather avoid that and get it working on my Windows though
63,2017-06-22T21:35:06.306444,Beula,Did you catch which dependency this error pops up under? My guess would be `cython`
63,2017-06-22T21:46:40.395514,Marcela,yes
63,2017-06-22T21:46:41.395754,Marcela,I believe it is Cython
63,2017-06-22T21:47:04.398661,Marcela,well
63,2017-06-22T21:47:07.399040,Marcela,it's running cl.exe
63,2017-06-22T21:47:09.399277,Marcela,I'm not sure what for
63,2017-06-22T21:47:29.401803,Marcela,actually it might be 'bitfield'
63,2017-06-22T21:47:45.403815,Collette,<@Marcela> <https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/InstallingOnWindows>
63,2017-06-22T21:48:26.409172,Marcela,looks like bitfield?
63,2017-06-22T21:52:47.442773,Beula,"It looks like you may be using anaconda? If so, I think they have pre-compiled everything for you"
63,2017-06-22T21:52:53.443722,Beula,I use unix for a reason...
63,2017-06-22T21:53:25.447797,Marcela,"yes, i was wondering, could anaconda be the issue here???"
63,2017-06-22T21:53:39.449666,Marcela,"do i need to install a separate python, and use a virtualenv for that"
63,2017-06-22T21:53:56.451914,Beula,"I am not sure, but I think instead of `pip install -r requirements.txt` -&gt; maybe use the anaconda packages ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
63,2017-06-22T21:54:04.452929,Marcela,mmmm
63,2017-06-22T23:17:26.040691,Johana,"yea, you’ll need to see if anaconda has it in their package manager."

63,2017-06-22T23:19:06.050956,Johana,this might help :point_up:
63,2017-06-23T04:50:00.887252,Gabriele,"Coming at this about 6 hours late, but any C/C++ process that is trying to #include &lt;io.h&gt; or &lt;unistd.h&gt; isn't configured properly for Windows. Arguably that's a flaw with the packages setup process but it also means there is usually a prebuilt lib somewhere online."
63,2017-06-23T05:18:34.296095,Suellen,<@Gabriele> doesn't MinGW have `unistd.h`?
63,2017-06-23T05:19:29.309069,Gabriele,"<@Suellen> Probably, but it's not 2002 any more"
63,2017-06-23T05:19:39.311286,Suellen,what do you mean? :confused:
63,2017-06-23T05:19:58.315453,Gabriele,MinGW is what people used on Windows when Visual C++ cost money and there was no other decent alternative
63,2017-06-23T05:20:05.317265,Suellen,VC can be used without tearing hair out?
63,2017-06-23T05:20:17.320107,Gabriele,"Yes, unless you prefer gcc, in which case no"
63,2017-06-23T05:20:21.320970,Suellen,well I'm glad that's finally so
63,2017-06-23T12:13:15.327122,Marcela,hello mike
63,2017-06-23T12:13:45.337930,Marcela,<@Gabriele> How do I fix this?
63,2017-06-23T12:14:08.345853,Marcela,there is a setup.py that contains #include io.h
63,2017-06-23T12:14:11.346918,Marcela,but i could not remove that line
63,2017-06-23T12:14:41.357437,Gabriele,Install the package via a different method. Its website might have some clues
63,2017-06-23T12:16:19.392192,Beula,"Yeah, I suggested using anaconda since it should have the precompiled one available"
63,2017-06-23T12:18:52.445851,Marcela,yeah i am trying that but am running into different issue
63,2017-06-23T12:19:05.450291,Marcela,it says it cannot find bitfield on the proper channels
63,2017-06-23T12:19:07.450937,Marcela,but i found this one here

63,2017-06-23T12:19:26.457228,Marcela,and its not working
63,2017-06-23T12:19:32.459312,Marcela,is it easier to set up a virtual linux env at this point? lol ugh
63,2017-06-23T12:21:03.490757,Gabriele,Without the exact errors it's hard to say

63,2017-06-23T12:30:05.680152,Ciera,or try the linux subsystem
63,2017-06-23T12:30:17.684689,Ciera,might be worth it if you can't fully migrate
63,2017-06-23T12:31:20.706826,Gabriele,"<@Marcela> I'm intrigued as to why you can find a package online, and which claims to be platform-independent, but it appears to not show up when you use `conda install`. That's probably worth taking up with someone more familiar with using conda"
63,2017-06-23T12:31:30.710232,Marcela,yep
63,2017-06-23T12:31:35.711807,Marcela,that error pissed me off lol
63,2017-06-23T12:33:02.742476,Gabriele,If you don't _need_ to use anaconda then find the regular package and see if there's a Windows version
63,2017-06-23T12:34:11.765216,Gabriele,"You said ""there is a setup.py that contains #include io.h"" but that's not true of the bitfield package, so it's not clear what your actual problem is"

64,2017-06-23T13:20:10.713752,Twila,If i use round
64,2017-06-23T13:20:15.715770,Twila,its show 2.0

64,2017-06-23T13:20:38.724390,Patty,what happens when you called `round` after using `from __future__ import division`?
64,2017-06-23T13:21:33.745578,Twila,try run this:
64,2017-06-23T13:21:34.745972,Twila,"from __future__ import division
round(140 / (18 * 3), 2)"
64,2017-06-23T13:21:43.749638,Twila,the result is 2.59
64,2017-06-23T13:21:53.753496,Twila,i need in this case rounding to 3.0
64,2017-06-23T13:22:14.760626,Patty,"the second argument to `round` is how many significant digits to give, you’re asking it for 2"
64,2017-06-23T13:22:53.775364,Patty,hence it being 2.59
64,2017-06-23T13:23:02.778334,Patty,remove the second argument to the round function to get a whole number

65,2017-06-23T13:18:11.667269,Marcela,<@Gabriele> I tried using virtualenv to install requirements.txt that way but had huge problems
65,2017-06-23T13:38:46.111426,Gabriele,"<@Marcela> virtualenv won't change the underlying problem, unfortunately. It just changes where the final packages get stored"
65,2017-06-23T13:39:13.120548,Marcela,yeah
65,2017-06-23T13:39:32.127139,Marcela,i cant edit setup.py to remove #include io.h for some reason
65,2017-06-23T13:43:30.209908,Gabriele,Why do you think there is that include inside setup.py?
65,2017-06-23T13:43:46.215749,Gabriele,"#include is a C/C++ construct, setup.py is Python"
65,2017-06-23T13:54:32.443642,Marcela,"idk, tbh"
65,2017-06-23T13:54:37.445189,Marcela,this is my first time setting up a python environment
65,2017-06-23T13:59:10.544435,Patty,some cursory googling makes this sound like a VS issue
65,2017-06-23T14:04:00.649949,Marcela,yeah
65,2017-06-23T14:04:07.652420,Marcela,ive installed all i can
65,2017-06-23T14:04:08.652540,Marcela,llo
65,2017-06-23T14:04:09.652886,Marcela,lol
65,2017-06-23T14:04:30.660231,Marcela,i believe its vs2015_runtime because anaconda automatically installs that one for me
65,2017-06-23T14:04:43.664700,Marcela,however when i try to install it myself in venv i am getting the io.h issues
65,2017-06-23T14:04:54.668637,Marcela,or maybe that is still a completely separate issue
65,2017-06-23T14:05:21.677712,Marcela,the fact that it cannot detect bitfield in anaconda even though i am looking right at the package is weird to me
65,2017-06-23T14:05:50.687844,Patty,because VS doesn’t know where to look for the header: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40018405/cython-cannot-open-include-file-io-h-no-such-file-or-directory>
65,2017-06-23T14:36:13.322695,Marcela,yeah i remember trying that two days ago
65,2017-06-23T14:36:17.324180,Marcela,i forgot why it wasnt working
65,2017-06-23T14:36:19.324942,Marcela,should try again today
65,2017-06-23T14:38:42.373618,Gabriele,"I know I mentioned it earlier but references to io.h are usually a bad sign on Windows, and references to unistd.h are almost certainly wrong"
65,2017-06-23T14:39:13.383964,Gabriele,It implies that something is not picking up the platform correctly; or just isn't designed to build on Windows at all
65,2017-06-23T14:41:20.428048,Patty,"we also have <#C5XHHMXHB|os_windows> and someone may know there, or maybe a linux VM would be easier at this point ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
65,2017-06-23T14:47:07.545330,Gabriele,"ugh, looks like pyconfig.h is usually output by the configure script... so who knows what state it might be in when a Windows compiler gets hold of it"
65,2017-06-23T15:02:22.856635,Marcela,yeah i believe that is one of the problems
65,2017-06-23T15:02:40.862780,Marcela,read in another thread that windows has a tendency to mishandle the script
65,2017-06-23T15:02:56.867741,Marcela,"if i put Linux Bash on Windows, am I able to set up an environment that way?"
65,2017-06-23T15:03:08.871990,Marcela,or linux VM yeah like joe suggested
65,2017-06-23T15:09:36.997768,Meg,why don't you skip windows entirely
65,2017-06-23T15:09:41.999257,Meg,and go straight to linux vm?
65,2017-06-23T15:09:55.003639,Meg,"you've been bashing your head against this issue for, what, two days now?"
65,2017-06-23T15:10:19.011239,Meg,"I'd say you've given it an honest effort, now use something that _works_"
65,2017-06-23T15:36:06.475340,Marcela,yeah. i think im just stubborn
65,2017-06-23T15:36:11.476860,Marcela,its a side project so im not rushed for time
65,2017-06-23T15:36:14.477699,Marcela,but its time to admit defeat lol
65,2017-06-23T15:36:54.488925,Marcela,"if i remember correctly, there are vms that are basically terminal only right?"
65,2017-06-23T15:38:30.516334,Patty,"the VMs just run whatever image you give them, and most linux images are the full OS. why do you ask?"
65,2017-06-23T15:39:34.534534,Beula,You could do `vagrant`
65,2017-06-23T15:39:42.536737,Beula,Pretty easy to set up and reproduce your dev env that way
65,2017-06-23T15:46:33.654562,Marcela,i was just thinking of minimalistic options
65,2017-06-23T15:46:59.661732,Marcela,but i guess i'd like IDEs and guis and such
66,2017-06-23T18:50:37.237989,Minh,hello
66,2017-06-23T18:51:32.246001,Minh,anyone know regex that find url link with specific type eg:<http://eg.com/asd.pdf>
66,2017-06-23T18:51:50.248721,Meg,type of what?
66,2017-06-23T18:52:03.250665,Meg,what is specific about that that you need to match?
66,2017-06-23T18:52:17.252731,Minh,specific extension
66,2017-06-23T18:52:23.253565,Minh,like .pdf
66,2017-06-23T18:52:26.253966,Minh,.mp4
66,2017-06-23T18:54:10.268992,Patty,Are you more concerned with the extension itself or what kind of file it is?
66,2017-06-23T18:54:44.273766,Patty,Because you can get a lot from the `Content-Type` header when you make a request to it
66,2017-06-23T18:54:58.275798,Patty,Unless you only have strings that are the URLs
66,2017-06-23T18:55:56.284234,Patty,And if you go that route the `mimetypes` module can guess and extension from that
66,2017-06-23T18:57:40.299111,Minh,<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/master/free-programming-books.md>

66,2017-06-23T18:59:45.317689,Minh,"im already used mimetypes but its iterates all link,all i want is find url with .pdf extension then download it"
66,2017-06-23T19:02:16.343128,Patty,So only save the ones with the correct mimetype. <@Meg> if I'm missing anything feel free to step in this is more your wheelhouse
66,2017-06-23T19:02:24.344301,Minh,yea correct
66,2017-06-23T19:02:29.344966,Meg,"here's what I'd do.

install <https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/> and beautiful soup"
66,2017-06-23T19:02:35.345847,Meg,and requests
66,2017-06-23T19:02:58.349003,Meg,"use requests to get that link you posted above, put it into python-markdown to convert to html"
66,2017-06-23T19:03:02.349715,Patty,Yes thank you I'm on my phone and scraping is a lot to type
66,2017-06-23T19:03:32.353872,Meg,then use beautifulsoup to extract all `&lt;a&gt;` tags ending in `.pdf`
66,2017-06-23T19:03:40.354829,Meg,that'll give you a list of URLs
66,2017-06-23T19:04:21.360889,Meg,"you can then use `requests` to get the content of each link, then use basic python file IO to write the response data to a file on your machine"
66,2017-06-23T19:05:33.371162,Meg,a possibly simpler version would be to get the text content of that link
66,2017-06-23T19:06:03.375174,Meg,"split each line by `(`, and check if each result ends in .pdf"
66,2017-06-23T19:06:33.379252,Meg,"but not sure how accurate it would be, since there are different ways a `(` can appear in markdown"
66,2017-06-23T19:07:15.385062,Minh,"ok, i'll try the first solution"
66,2017-06-23T19:07:25.386302,Minh,thanks you very much
66,2017-06-23T19:07:49.389463,Meg,good luck

70,2017-06-24T13:23:35.065830,Gabriele,It could be that your data set is just too big for the amount of RAM in your computer. Are you using 64 bit Anaconda or 32 bit?
70,2017-06-24T13:26:08.075378,Philip,"i just found out that the python env that i'm using in anaconda is 32 bit, i'll try with the 64 bit version. it's strange anyway as i was monitoring the amount of ram used and it never went up of more that 200/300 MB on a 16GB ram machine"
70,2017-06-24T13:27:04.078758,Gabriele,"It could be that the operation you wanted to perform tried to allocate 2GB or more in one go and failed, meaning you never saw it go from 300MB to an intended 2300MB (or similar)"

70,2017-06-24T13:30:52.093615,Gabriele,anaconda offers downloads of each - you'd probably want to uninstall the 32 bit version and install the 64 bit one
70,2017-06-24T13:32:40.100503,Philip,"i usually tend to install the 64 bit version the of software i use, is there a way to verify that indeed my anaconda installation is a 64 bit one? running python inside an environment says 32 bit"

71,2017-06-25T15:53:24.448663,Ruben,"I think when you use --data with curl, it will do a HTTP POST request, with the data in the request body."
71,2017-06-25T15:54:30.452313,Ruben,"To do the same with `requests`, you'd use `r = <http://requests.post|requests.post>(""<http://httpbin.org/post>"", data=payload)`"
71,2017-06-25T15:55:06.454234,Ruben,"So, `<http://requests.post|requests.post>()` instead of `requests.get()` to make a HTTP POST request."

72,2017-06-26T03:24:20.832948,Mirna,Hi everyone. Which service or tool for crawling website with javascript? For me i used phantomjs and selenium. But their performance is so poor.
72,2017-06-26T03:25:14.841904,Ruben,I often use `requests` in combination with `BeautifulSoup` (using the `lxml` parser).
72,2017-06-26T03:25:40.846439,Ruben,"However, that's not a JavaScript solution. Sorry!"
72,2017-06-26T03:34:27.938809,Collette,<@Mirna> is this some sort of single page web app?
72,2017-06-26T03:37:48.973866,Mirna,Kind of. Because some pages need to excute javasript for rendering full content. So i have to find some browser which can excute javascript for making dynamic crawler.
72,2017-06-26T03:38:29.980967,Mirna,But according to real life experience. I see phantomjs or selenium is so slow
72,2017-06-26T03:38:47.984069,Mirna,one minute they can only render 5-6 page
72,2017-06-26T03:38:58.985997,Mirna,Which cannot serve my purpose
72,2017-06-26T03:39:13.988975,Ruben,Maybe spread the workload out to multiple VMs and let each do a part of the URLspace?
72,2017-06-26T03:40:30.003203,Collette,<@Mirna> can't you just repeat queries that javascript is making and get the data from the backend directly?
72,2017-06-26T03:42:24.023339,Mirna,Can i make DM with you <@Collette> ?
72,2017-06-26T03:43:11.031778,Collette,Let's keep our conversation public
72,2017-06-26T03:43:36.036140,Collette,I'm not the only one who can help you
72,2017-06-26T03:45:04.052317,Mirna,"Ok. I’m afraid that i will mess our channel.
So the problem is i’m making a crawler which can extract the article main content of any news website."
72,2017-06-26T03:45:40.059508,Mirna,So for making that i have to get the css and javascript for detecting which is article page and navigation page.
72,2017-06-26T03:46:40.070759,Mirna,My only bottleneck is page rendering tools. For this i used phantomjs and selenium.
72,2017-06-26T03:47:06.075626,Mirna,But with their pool performances i can’t really use this for production
72,2017-06-26T03:47:19.077899,Collette,"Yeah, you said that a couple of times already."
72,2017-06-26T03:48:10.087052,Tresa,and not the only who need to solve it
72,2017-06-26T03:48:21.089166,Collette,<@Mirna> have you seen my previous question?
72,2017-06-26T03:52:22.135628,Mirna,"Yup already. But it can’t help. Some web pages make different requests ajax for rendering full content each page. So if i write some algorithm for detecting those request format and fake it. It will make my issue extremely complex. So for reducing the complex, i used some service which can return me the full content after javascript executing."
72,2017-06-26T03:53:15.146205,Mirna,<@Collette> and sorry for repeating my issue. I just want to centralize again all of my issue.
72,2017-06-26T03:54:17.158505,Collette,"You still have to parse the returned page, right? Then how parsing different parts is it more complex than rendering everything and parsing parts as a whole?"
72,2017-06-26T03:55:15.169701,Collette,"You don't need to write an algorithm to detect requests. You just need to open the page, to look into web inspector and copy-paste related queries from ""Network"" tab"
72,2017-06-26T03:55:19.170651,Collette,That's pretty much it
72,2017-06-26T04:00:28.236368,Mirna,Because I have to find a way to deal with “Any” pages not for specific one as you suggest.
72,2017-06-26T04:02:43.266386,Collette,"You have to find a way to deal with all pages you're interested in, yes.
If that's such a huge problem, then your only way is to use selenium/headless chrome/whatever"
72,2017-06-26T04:04:52.293463,Mirna,"Yes, so i want to ask if someone had deal with this problem already."
72,2017-06-26T04:08:22.338826,Ruben,<@Mirna> Apparently your problem is slowness and lack of processing capacity. Maybe using multiple machines is an option?
72,2017-06-26T04:09:29.352916,Ruben,"I mean, instead of machine 1 processing news sites A, B and C in succession, you start 3 machines, where machine 1 will process news site A, machine 2 news site B and machine 3 news site C. That will give a 3x speedup."
72,2017-06-26T04:13:21.400498,Mirna,"Yes i’ve already done that. But i wonder if there is some tool can do this better than phantomjs either selenium. Right now i used 3 servers but only 200 page/ minute has been rendered.
I used cache and proxy and image replacing for reducing the time cost. But it is only slightly better"
72,2017-06-26T04:14:05.409858,Suellen,"sorry to interject, i haven't read everything, but one instance per core (minus 1-2 cores for main process) gives us about 30 headless browsers per machine"
72,2017-06-26T04:14:20.413128,Suellen,on a second-to-largest GCC instance
72,2017-06-26T04:14:41.417743,Suellen,"also, headless chrome :heart:"
72,2017-06-26T04:19:56.486388,Mirna,I used to open 10 instance of headless browser per machine. But the time cost increases with instance of headless browser. More instance ---&gt; more time for rendering.
72,2017-06-26T04:20:14.490253,Mirna,I don’t know if i’m doing something wrong with that
72,2017-06-26T04:20:20.491782,Suellen,how many cores on these machines?
72,2017-06-26T04:20:38.495966,Mirna,8 cores.
72,2017-06-26T04:21:01.500796,Suellen,10 is too many then :slightly_smiling_face:
72,2017-06-26T04:22:10.515646,Mirna,Anywho thanks for your suggestion with headless chrome. I will take a try with it
72,2017-06-26T04:22:10.515813,Mirna,:slightly_smiling_face:
73,2017-06-26T05:32:01.483939,Meg,"so, phantom is notorious for being slow, and having problems"
73,2017-06-26T05:32:52.496072,Meg,"not surprising since its been a one-person project for a number of years now.  given the challenges of browser development, phantom's state of functionality is impressive with that restriction"
73,2017-06-26T05:33:12.500356,Meg,"however, it is now deprecated and no longer supported since headless chrome came out"
73,2017-06-26T05:33:50.509129,Meg,"and unfortunately, this is an instance of where horizontal scaling will have to be used, where you distribute the tasks to be executed among a cluster of similar instances"
73,2017-06-26T05:34:35.519124,Meg,"just like with celery workers, there's a sweet spot that can be hit with tasks on each machine for optimium efficiency, but that takes alot of experimenting to do."
73,2017-06-26T05:35:11.527138,Meg,"<@Mirna> what instance size are you running this on, and what provider?  AWS, GCC, Azure?"
73,2017-06-26T05:40:09.595895,Mirna,It’s running on my own server company. Not provided by any companies above.
73,2017-06-26T05:42:54.633610,Meg,then your only option is to either reduce the rate of crawling or add more hardware
73,2017-06-26T05:43:50.646043,Meg,because the primary issue is rendering the page and there is a significant lack of options for that
73,2017-06-26T05:47:14.692455,Mirna,Thanks for your advice Jason.
73,2017-06-26T05:52:29.762481,Meg,good luck

80,2017-06-27T05:55:27.812156,Gabriele,You can have as many link elements as you want
80,2017-06-27T05:58:33.858110,Georgeann,"and where do I add styles?
in noscript? - it's not working."
80,2017-06-27T06:00:28.888095,Gabriele,The noscript stuff only runs when there is no script. So I'm guessing that 'loadCSS.min.js' handles all your stylesheets. I'm guessing that's part of some client-side framework you're using
80,2017-06-27T06:04:23.946646,Georgeann,"In General, I can't understand how to make styles with loadcss"
80,2017-06-27T06:04:57.955002,Gabriele,Why are you using it?

80,2017-06-27T06:07:24.989958,Gabriele,You need to understand how loadCSS works if you want to use it
80,2017-06-27T06:07:55.997200,Georgeann,it true:slightly_frowning_face:
80,2017-06-27T06:08:02.998806,Gabriele,"The standard way to use CSS is the `&lt;link&gt;` element, as seen in the noscript section. If you have those link elements outside of the noscript, they will work"

80,2017-06-27T06:17:03.122018,Temika,Opening a file in Python - is it relative to the file location calling the file open?
80,2017-06-27T06:17:35.129119,Temika,"I’m hard coding a path for now, and have `fp = open(""../../../media/images/e772778c-9002-4268-a515-b3ced6175723.png"", ""r"")` but it isn’t finding it. That file does exist though"
80,2017-06-27T06:17:42.130497,Temika,Or is it best to go from the root?
80,2017-06-27T06:19:17.151537,Gabriele,"Opening a file is much the same in most languages - it's relative to the current working directory, which _might_ be the directory that the program lives in, but it can be anything"
80,2017-06-27T06:19:59.161157,Gabriele,"What is quite typical is to have the program configuration specify a base directory, and for the application to find files relative to that"
80,2017-06-27T06:32:50.326792,Aimee,"what is the best (=efficient, pythonic) way to scrape a lot of (ca. 100k) urls which are stored in a list of dicts (e. g. `[{'url': '<http://foo.com/bar|foo.com/bar>', 'category': 'moon'}, ...]` ) and return their status code? i am currently using `urllib2` library which takes about 22s for 100 urls - which would be awfully long when doing it for 100k urls."

80,2017-06-27T06:33:15.331627,Temika,`requests` is preferred over `urllib2` nowadays I think

80,2017-06-27T06:34:08.343131,Temika,Could also try running it async? I guess it’ll be taking so long because it’ll be waiting for the request to come back before moving onto the next one
80,2017-06-27T06:35:01.354081,Aimee,<@Temika> could you explain this a bit more? i am not completely clear on how to setup async code
80,2017-06-27T06:36:08.367932,Aimee,<@Temika> i have experienced issues with `requests` on multiple occasions where the url would not be opened correctly vs. `urllib2` never had this so far. thats why i have opted for the latter
80,2017-06-27T06:36:35.373562,Temika,Are you running Python 2 or 3?
80,2017-06-27T06:36:48.376152,Aimee,currently 2.7

84,2017-06-27T11:34:50.199757,Meg,correct
84,2017-06-27T11:35:16.210521,Meg,I can find things for spelling correction
84,2017-06-27T11:35:26.215163,Meg,but not with capitalization
84,2017-06-27T11:35:56.228261,Meg,"yeah, agreed"
84,2017-06-27T11:36:05.232399,Meg,"I mean, I could lowercase them all"
84,2017-06-27T11:36:26.241495,Gabriele,The example you gave is a good edge case... because capitalisation works differently if the context is a heading
84,2017-06-27T11:36:34.245225,Meg,correct
84,2017-06-27T11:36:41.248066,Meg,all this is text extracted from a PDF

87,2017-06-27T13:09:56.535046,Hyman,Hello guys I got a huge problem
87,2017-06-27T13:10:44.553240,Myong,<@Hyman> ask away
87,2017-06-27T13:13:12.608617,Hyman,We've been ask as assignment the implementation of Dijkstra's and Bellman Ford's algorithm for calculating the shortest path in a given graph
87,2017-06-27T13:14:11.631014,Myong,So what's the issue?
87,2017-06-27T13:14:20.634557,Myong,run into a problem?
87,2017-06-27T13:15:05.651654,Hyman,I don't really know how to start and that's my problem
87,2017-06-27T13:16:31.684418,Myong,"Well were you given code to start off with as far as ""i will give you this input"" in order to build the graph you have with the path weights and what not?"
87,2017-06-27T13:18:01.718549,Hyman,The Input to the algorithms is an oriented graph with weights
87,2017-06-27T13:18:40.733389,Myong,"So then you have to build the graph in the code, yes?"
87,2017-06-27T13:20:01.763870,Hyman,More precisely compute the shortest path from a given source to all the other nodes
87,2017-06-27T13:22:00.809588,Myong,"I understand that, I am just asking if you have anything to build off of like code given to you to complete the task or if you have to start from scratch and build the graph in code then calculate it."
87,2017-06-27T13:28:26.961067,Hyman,You need to code the algorithm from scratch and supply it with a graph in a text file and it'll calculate the shortest path in it
87,2017-06-27T13:29:05.976389,Myong,can you give an example input
87,2017-06-27T13:32:12.050908,Meg,<@Hyman> how much experience do you have writing code?
87,2017-06-27T13:32:38.061507,Meg,"for example, there are quite a number of existing examples of the algorithms you're talking about"
87,2017-06-27T13:32:47.064717,Hyman,basic i'm just starting
87,2017-06-27T13:32:50.066257,Meg,ok
87,2017-06-27T13:33:03.070903,Meg,can you describe the steps on how you execute the algorithm?
87,2017-06-27T13:33:19.077301,Meg,and do you understand why those steps are necessary?
87,2017-06-27T13:33:53.090833,Meg,"if so, then the next step you take is translating your written description of the process into pseudocode"
87,2017-06-27T13:34:17.100153,Meg,"once you have a reasonable sequence of actions, you then implement the pseudocode in your language of choice"
87,2017-06-27T13:34:41.109545,Meg,"frankly, the first two items are always the most difficult"
87,2017-06-27T13:34:52.113909,Meg,because it requires you to understand the problem domain
87,2017-06-27T13:35:08.120307,Meg,"once you understand it, making it work is usually much less effort"
87,2017-06-27T13:41:19.264188,Patty,"oof graph theory for a beginner. do you understand how those algorithms work, <@Hyman> ?"
87,2017-06-27T13:42:14.285096,Hyman,Yes I understand how those work
87,2017-06-27T13:42:34.292979,Meg,just having trouble translating described steps to code?
88,2017-06-27T14:45:28.807216,Meghan,"I saw this today, <https://github.com/stackimpact/stackimpact-python>. Looks nice, but don't think we could use that internally. Anyone have any experience with Stack Impact, or know of something that would provide similar data without sending it to an outside source? Even just having the data print out at the end of a run would be great."
88,2017-06-27T15:29:03.785865,Signe,<@Meghan> I dont know of any tool that does all of that. But I know of many tools that do peices
88,2017-06-27T15:29:15.790305,Signe,What data are you mainly interested in?
88,2017-06-27T15:29:35.797226,Meghan,"The charts are pretty, but I would just like to see which calls are blocking and for how long."
88,2017-06-27T15:30:09.809843,Meghan,"For most of my code it's pretty clear anyway, and I throw in timing decorators at the really long ones."
88,2017-06-27T15:30:37.819912,Signe,"so, if you just want CPU profiling, then vprof works really well."
88,2017-06-27T15:30:39.820608,Meghan,Having a monitoring system for users who use my scripts would be nice too though. Right now I just have them email the logs if somethign goes wrong.
88,2017-06-27T15:30:54.825846,Signe,"So, for ""errors"", I highly recommend sentry"
88,2017-06-27T15:31:14.832771,Signe,"basically, anyone not using sentry, should be doing it right now"
88,2017-06-27T15:31:21.835450,Signe,its a game changer
88,2017-06-27T15:31:22.835814,Meghan,"Having a syslog server for loggign would be amazing, however the logs get extremely large for some scripts."
88,2017-06-27T15:32:11.852917,Meghan,One of them produces a log so large the last step in the script is to zip and delete its own logs.
88,2017-06-27T15:32:26.858378,Signe,"So, what do you actually use the logs for though?"
88,2017-06-27T15:32:33.860898,Signe,just trying to figure out what went wrong?
88,2017-06-27T15:33:04.872033,Meghan,"Determine why some data was missed or not parsed correctly, why communication failed on a device, why an exception occurred."
88,2017-06-27T15:33:09.873712,Meghan,Yeah
88,2017-06-27T15:33:26.880092,Signe,I would try using sentry instead of logging
88,2017-06-27T15:33:30.881403,Signe,it might change your life
88,2017-06-27T15:33:41.885531,Meghan,The worst of them runs as a cron job and downloads a few hundred mb of text from 60 routers.
88,2017-06-27T15:33:48.887740,Meghan,"I'll take a look, tahnks."
88,2017-06-27T15:34:08.895046,Signe,here is the page: <https://sentry.io/welcome/>
88,2017-06-27T15:34:26.901611,Signe,"but its an Open source project, so you can host it yourself and dont have to use the SaaS"
88,2017-06-27T15:36:02.935408,Carlie,"Is anyone aware of a standard library utility related to the `ast` module that can extract the source of a function without evaluation? Or more specifically, the ability to trace the execution path to a function without evaluation?"
88,2017-06-27T15:37:09.958856,Signe,what are you really looking for?
88,2017-06-27T15:37:17.962097,Signe,there are various ones for different things
88,2017-06-27T15:37:32.967292,Signe,"if you just want to look at the function, etc, then `inspect` works pretty well"
88,2017-06-27T15:38:50.995281,Signe,"&gt; the ability to trace the execution path to a function without evaluation
What does this mean? you want to look and see what the ""stack"" might look like had the function ran?"
88,2017-06-27T15:41:17.047910,Carlie,"<@Signe> Right, I'm essentially trying to get the stack without actually executing the code."
88,2017-06-27T15:44:13.109929,Wilber,can you display what your dataframe looks like and what you want it to look like?
88,2017-06-27T15:44:24.114045,Wilber,i.e. are you trying to just drop a row?

89,2017-06-27T16:26:24.034909,Signe,"So, `inspect` will give you the source code, then you can keep going down that path"
89,2017-06-27T16:31:47.153153,Carlie,"<@Georgeann> I believe `read_html` tries to find a `&lt;table&gt;` tag in the HTML, so if you want to load an HTML table into a DataFrame, then that would probably be a good usage instead of trying to extract it yourself with XPath or another XML parsing library."

92,2017-06-27T21:41:59.185243,Beula,I figure that's enough to not lock us in too much if we need more. A simple migration could get us to a more involved permissions model
93,2017-06-28T05:05:44.281519,Venita,"Hi guys. There is one site that returns response in string like: `{""ConsignorName"": ""first part ""second part""""}` which should be json. Result should be `{'ConsignorName': 'first part ""second part""'}`. And I can't just `json.loads(data)` because it fails with `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Expecting ',' delimiter:...`.  So I somehow need to cast this string in dict. Maybe u know some easy fast pythonic way to do this? So far I came up with blunt operations with split and check for double quotes inside double quotes and u can see it's already getting boring and I'm gonna stop right here :sweat:"
93,2017-06-28T05:12:48.391252,Gabriele,"It is actually broken JSON, so I'm surprised that it returns it. You can `strip` the { and }, then use `split` on the "":"", and you should have the key and the value"

93,2017-06-28T05:21:08.516764,Ruben,Probably they're not using a json library to generate that output. I guess they're just concatenating strings and hope for the best.
93,2017-06-28T05:22:00.530140,Tresa,they can replace unicode quotes after converting it into string
93,2017-06-28T05:22:31.538099,Ruben,These people would write `&lt;consignorname&gt;&lt;first&gt;Jan&lt;second&gt;de Vries&lt;/first&gt;&lt;/second&gt;&lt;/consignorname&gt;` if they were to output XML ;-)
93,2017-06-28T05:25:38.586538,Venita,U know the funny thing? They return xml and inside that xml is a string that should represent json. Like wtf :laughing::sweat_smile:
93,2017-06-28T05:26:02.592608,Venita,I'm surprised `requests` can even parse that

95,2017-06-28T14:01:51.014927,Patty,"hmm, not python but have you looked at jekyll?"
95,2017-06-28T14:03:50.064751,Gabriele,I'm on Windows and Jekyll is a bit awkward on that platform
95,2017-06-28T14:04:04.070417,Patty,"ah, okay, just thought id toss that one out there"
95,2017-06-28T14:13:29.292627,Johana,sphinx should be able take care of the pygments and ReStructuredText parts.
95,2017-06-28T14:14:30.316275,Gabriele,I think my problem is that ReStructuredText is really not that good
95,2017-06-28T14:15:15.333780,Gabriele,"If you want more control over the formatting, for instance. Rules like ""Multiple successive blank lines are equivalent to a single blank line"" make it awkward to introduce whitespace for readability"
95,2017-06-28T14:15:52.348305,Gabriele,"And if I want to highlight the code, I can do that in blocks via Pygments, but not in literals"

95,2017-06-28T14:22:16.497992,Gabriele,"<@Johana>  That sounds useful, especially since I've found that both Markdown and reST each only do about 80% of what I want... a different 80%... but unfortunately I only need to do this one piece of documentation then I'll probably never need it again, so it's hard to justify the time expense"

97,2017-06-28T15:35:14.149372,Georgeann,"Hi, all.
How do I calculate the difference between two dates is best?
The output should only be in months.
The only way I could.
```
In [25]: startDay
Out[25]: datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 1, 0, 0)


In [26]: endDay
Out[26]: datetime.datetime(2017, 1, 1, 0, 0)


In [27]: startDay - endDay
Out[27]: datetime.timedelta(151)


In [28]: different = startDay - endDay


In [29]: different.days//30
Out[29]: 5```"
97,2017-06-28T15:35:38.157887,Gabriele,How do you define months in this context?
97,2017-06-28T15:36:17.171635,Georgeann,<@Gabriele> sorry?
97,2017-06-28T15:36:38.179095,Gabriele,A month is not a fixed unit of time (at least not in the cultures I know of)
97,2017-06-28T15:37:20.193134,Georgeann,I need to know how many months have passed between two dates
97,2017-06-28T15:37:47.202997,Gabriele,If you want the intuitive answer then I think you will just have to check the difference in years and months individually
97,2017-06-28T15:39:04.229420,Georgeann,"for example I started it today - June 2017, and the end - June 2016. The difference - 12 months"
97,2017-06-28T15:39:47.244232,Georgeann,I think the best way is to pass the Python...
97,2017-06-28T15:40:17.254301,Gabriele,Does this work? `((endDay.year - startDay.year) * 12) + (endDay.month - startDay.month)`
97,2017-06-28T15:40:52.266621,Georgeann,works
97,2017-06-28T15:41:41.283478,Georgeann,Thank you. You are a genius.
97,2017-06-28T15:41:43.284293,Gabriele,You can't use timedelta for this because a span of 30 days is over a month if the span starts on Feb 1st and under a month if the span starts on Jan 1st
97,2017-06-28T15:41:50.286880,Gabriele,no problem
97,2017-06-28T15:42:05.292442,Georgeann,exactly...
97,2017-06-28T15:42:31.301636,Signe,"<@Meghan> if you self host, there is no limit"
97,2017-06-28T15:42:44.306346,Signe,I would recommend that. With docker its really not all that hard to host it
97,2017-06-28T15:44:39.346631,Signe,"thats what I do. All similar systems will have some type of limit. There is also bugsnag, and rollbar, but they all have limits"
97,2017-06-28T15:45:18.360825,Signe,"self hosting is the only way to have no limits. Oh, I guess google cloud has one called stack-driver that is just a flat monthly fee + minimal data charges"
97,2017-06-28T15:52:11.508101,Suellen,use `dateutil`
97,2017-06-28T15:53:43.542023,Beula,"or `maya` or `arrow`, etc"
97,2017-06-28T15:53:43.542106,Gabriele,That's cheating :wink:

97,2017-06-28T15:53:50.544626,Gabriele,I don't think arrow helps here
97,2017-06-28T15:54:20.555853,Suellen,"if you don't need to do anything complex, dateutil is nice and small"
97,2017-06-28T15:54:26.558103,Beula,"Just use a unix timestamp and do maths in second offsets :wink: Of course, then there is the problem of leap seconds..."
97,2017-06-28T15:54:34.561334,Suellen,and often is already installed as a dependency of another package
97,2017-06-28T15:54:43.564288,Suellen,"arrow is cool, but it's for really complex stuff"
97,2017-06-28T15:54:51.567010,Gabriele,"just don't use dateutil for parsing, because it often guesses wrong"
97,2017-06-28T15:55:22.578447,Johana,this way i was able to style it differently in css.
97,2017-06-28T15:55:43.585988,Gabriele,<@Johana>  Looks like a good approach. Something I'll consider if I find myself doing this again
97,2017-06-28T15:56:16.598129,Signe,whats the cleanest/shortest way to check if any value in a tuple is in another tuple?
97,2017-06-28T15:56:21.599680,Signe,"for example:
```
for i in tup1:
  for j in tup2:
    if i == j:
      return True
return False
```"
97,2017-06-28T15:57:09.616940,Signe,I have a feeling there are some built in's I can use...
97,2017-06-28T15:57:32.625766,Suellen,<@Beula> they needed an offset in months (see thread)
97,2017-06-28T15:57:43.630245,Suellen,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; start = datetime(2016, 12, 29)

Using seconds is just wrong :confused:"
97,2017-06-28T15:57:44.630451,Beula,<@Suellen> then convert back
97,2017-06-28T15:58:16.641995,Suellen,you can't count how many months passed if you only have unix timestamp 1 and unix timestamp 2
97,2017-06-28T15:58:23.644780,Ciera,"```
[ x for x in tup1 if x in tup2]

97,2017-06-28T15:59:22.666382,Beula,the perk of `any` over the list is it will short circuit itself on the first found one
97,2017-06-28T15:59:31.669746,Signe,"ya.. that works. Is it possible without an explicit loop? (im getting picky, but im challenging myself)"
97,2017-06-28T15:59:33.670255,Beula,since at least 1 is true
97,2017-06-28T15:59:45.674654,Beula,probably operator
97,2017-06-28T16:00:16.687353,Signe,basically I want `if anything_in(some_list) in other_list)`
97,2017-06-28T16:00:24.690667,Signe,but I dont think thats possible
97,2017-06-28T16:00:35.694884,Beula,I think you could do a fancy with intersections or unions
97,2017-06-28T16:00:48.699728,Ciera,there is intersections for set not sure for tuple
97,2017-06-28T16:00:51.700765,Signe,oo now we are getting somewhere
97,2017-06-28T16:01:10.707942,Beula,:thinking_face:

97,2017-06-28T16:04:32.783014,Suellen,downside: no short circuiting

99,2017-06-28T17:36:51.673113,Winnifred,not exactly the same and I use `mkvirtualenv`
99,2017-06-28T17:36:59.675262,Sherry,Ahh okay
99,2017-06-28T17:37:12.678818,Sherry,why is it not `/usr/local/bin/python3`?
99,2017-06-28T17:37:53.691026,Beula,he installed via the python installer
99,2017-06-28T17:37:59.692714,Beula,`/usr/local/bin/python3` is from brew
99,2017-06-28T17:38:52.707905,Winnifred,"Thanks, <@Beula>. I actually didn’t have a solid answer there :neutral_face:. These are notes I took a long time ago that became a habit."
99,2017-06-28T17:41:35.754917,Sherry,"Hmm, i still can’t get it to work"
99,2017-06-28T17:41:49.758950,Sherry,"I’ve used the `--python=""/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/python3""` flag when creating the environment"
99,2017-06-28T17:42:17.766773,Sherry,here’s my terminal output from when i CD
99,2017-06-28T17:43:32.787867,Winnifred,what do you get when you run `python -V`
99,2017-06-28T17:44:32.804676,Sherry,A very long output!
99,2017-06-28T17:44:33.805014,Suzanna,I think it’s because you don’t have a pip3 under `bin` folder.
99,2017-06-28T17:45:13.816442,Beula,capital `V`
99,2017-06-28T17:45:29.821147,Beula,"you did lowercase, which is a verbose log of the interpreter starting"
99,2017-06-28T17:46:03.830432,Suzanna,"so it’s using a default `pip3` which installs libs into `/usr/local/lib`, but search path in environment is looking into `./lib/&lt;version&gt;/site-packages`?"
99,2017-06-28T17:46:19.834737,Sherry,"whoops, sorry!"
99,2017-06-28T17:46:43.841348,Beula,Looks like having a space in there is causing your problems
99,2017-06-28T17:47:00.845766,Beula,"So it's falling back to the system:

```
zsh: /Users/yousefissa/PycharmProjects/Small Projects/HOC/ultra_monitor/bin/pip3: bad interpreter: ""/Users/yousefissa/PycharmProjects/Small: no such file or directory
```"
99,2017-06-28T17:47:03.846664,Sherry,python 3.51
99,2017-06-28T17:47:14.849983,Sherry,Hmm
99,2017-06-28T17:47:18.851138,Beula,rename `Small\ Projects` to `small_projects`
99,2017-06-28T17:47:19.851315,Sherry,I can move it to my desktop
99,2017-06-28T17:47:43.857737,Beula,Or create your virtualenv at `~/.virtualenvs/my_project`
99,2017-06-28T17:47:47.858729,Beula,which is pretty standard
99,2017-06-28T17:51:05.912463,Sherry,Giving it a go
99,2017-06-28T17:52:47.939872,Sherry,"Perfect, that worked! Thank you!"
99,2017-06-28T17:53:12.946693,Sherry,What does adding this (`~/.virtualenvs/my_project`) at the end of the virtual environment actually do?
99,2017-06-28T17:53:35.952959,Beula,"It sets the location, is that what you are asking?"
99,2017-06-28T17:54:01.959941,Beula,`virtualenv -p $(which python3) ~/.virtualenvs/my_project`
99,2017-06-28T17:54:02.960077,Johana,it’s the destination of where the virtualenv will be created.
99,2017-06-28T17:54:19.964700,Beula,So now you need to `source ~/.virtualenvs/my_project/bin/activate` when you need it
99,2017-06-28T17:54:35.968861,Beula,"I add that to an `autoenv.zsh` script, so each project in my shell auto-sources."
99,2017-06-28T17:56:22.997584,Beula,If you use `virtualenvwrapper` it's even easier:  `mkproject -p $(which python3.6) my_app` and then later you can `workon my_app` and it auto put you in your source :slightly_smiling_face:
99,2017-06-28T18:00:31.064434,Sherry,Thank you so much guys! I’ve got a lot to learn about virtualenvironments
99,2017-06-28T18:00:37.066325,Johana,"i use `pyenv` with `pyenv-virtualenv`. both of them together allow you to use a `.python_version` file. The python_version file is kept in the root dir of your project. When you change into the project’s dir it will activate the right virtualenv for you. it’s quite nice although the instructions of getting it going weren’t all too clear.

111,2017-06-29T23:05:51.949379,Beula,You could try `today.isoformat()`

111,2017-06-29T23:08:44.967779,Margareta,something like that?

113,2017-06-30T05:06:07.258472,Lasonya,does anyone know of a way to fetch and update a user with a single db trip in django?
113,2017-06-30T05:12:10.348237,Collette,<@Lasonya> why?
113,2017-06-30T05:14:07.376999,Lasonya,i'm looking for a way to optimise my db calls
113,2017-06-30T05:14:28.382038,Lasonya,<@Collette>
113,2017-06-30T05:15:26.396264,Collette,<@Lasonya> have you profiled your views? Are you sure fetching and updating users is the most expensive operation?
113,2017-06-30T05:18:13.436922,Lasonya,well for large data sets it sure is <@Collette>. how do you mean 'profiled your views '?
113,2017-06-30T05:19:24.454458,Collette,I mean what makes you think that this is the most expensive operation? Do you _think_ so or you have profiled your code so you _know_ it's the most expensive operation?
113,2017-06-30T05:19:57.462785,Ruben,"Looking up one record in your user table, and updating that record, is really the bottleneck? That sounds quite suprising to me, too."
113,2017-06-30T05:21:37.487300,Collette,"That may be the bottleneck, for sure. Which is likely to be fixed by creating a proper index."
113,2017-06-30T05:22:55.506656,Ciera,anyways in sql you are able to retrieve data from an `update` query
113,2017-06-30T05:23:04.508603,Lasonya,<@Ruben> <@Collette> won't it be performant to have one db trip to fetch and update rather than have two trips?
113,2017-06-30T05:23:33.515872,Collette,"<@Lasonya> please, google about premature optimization"
113,2017-06-30T05:23:35.516325,Ruben,Your remark smells like premature optimisation
113,2017-06-30T05:23:45.518706,Collette,Ha
113,2017-06-30T05:24:36.531442,Lasonya,i like this <@Ciera>
113,2017-06-30T05:25:13.540303,Ruben,"<@Ciera> Some DBMSses indeed can, see RETURNING clause in PostgreSQL's UPDATE. <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/sql-update.html>"
113,2017-06-30T05:25:57.551430,Ciera,yeah that's what I was referring to
113,2017-06-30T05:26:25.557995,Ruben,...but don't expect such things to work in MySQL or Oracle.
113,2017-06-30T05:27:19.571085,Ruben,I never found the need to return something from an UPDATE (except maybe the nr. of records that were changed) because what I put into the UPDATE I have available in my program anyway.
113,2017-06-30T05:27:52.579247,Ruben,<@Ciera> So I'm curious about for what you want such a feature.
113,2017-06-30T05:31:18.630666,Ciera,we use it from time to time when we need to return ids for some processing (for example)
113,2017-06-30T05:31:43.636597,Suellen,"&gt; what I put into the UPDATE I have available in my program anyway
Not when there is an SQL function / expression in an UPDATE clause"
113,2017-06-30T05:32:59.655402,Ciera,you have available what you put in the update but you might not have all the row
113,2017-06-30T05:34:05.671116,Ciera,if you have read only data for example
113,2017-06-30T05:34:20.674541,Ruben,"Ah ok, I see. That might be handy indeed."
113,2017-06-30T05:35:20.689262,Suellen,I have to add: I don't think `UPDATE ... RETURNING ...` will increase performance substantially for a typical web app
113,2017-06-30T05:35:56.697993,Suellen,even the fastest ORM (something like Peewee) is still quite slow
113,2017-06-30T05:36:28.705792,Ciera,if your db is on the network you gain a bit
113,2017-06-30T05:36:42.709194,Ciera,but otherwise not really. It's just a nice to have
113,2017-06-30T05:36:43.709546,Suellen,"plus if I can get an empty page in 30 ms and a heavy page in 40 ms, then there is no point in optimizing just yet"
113,2017-06-30T05:59:45.038531,Lasonya,Thanks guys <@Ciera>  <@Ruben>  <@Collette>  <@Suellen> :taco:
113,2017-06-30T05:59:53.040553,Suellen,yum yum!
114,2017-06-30T11:24:35.675941,Rudolph,any pandas people in here?
114,2017-06-30T11:25:12.690499,Jeri,I’ve used it a little
114,2017-06-30T11:26:30.722523,Rudolph,I'm trying to do a groupby on a df
114,2017-06-30T11:26:44.727892,Rudolph,and the field I'm trying to group on needs to be preprocessed
114,2017-06-30T11:27:02.734853,Rudolph,I'm trying to figure out how to offload the preprocessing of that field to C so its not slow as crap
114,2017-06-30T11:28:06.760254,Rudolph,"it seems like `df.groupby(by=func_to_preprocess, df.ColumnToGroup)` should work, but the `by=` field seem to want the column header"
114,2017-06-30T11:28:13.762824,Rudolph,or a function
114,2017-06-30T11:28:15.763726,Rudolph,but not both
114,2017-06-30T11:40:50.060416,Winnifred,"<@Rudolph>, what is the function doing?"
114,2017-06-30T11:46:00.182256,Rudolph,"preprocessing the string, I'm just going to use `apply` to manipulate the column, then pass the column into groupby"
114,2017-06-30T11:46:06.184459,Rudolph,I was overthinking it :slightly_smiling_face:
114,2017-06-30T11:46:15.188288,Rudolph,thanks <@Winnifred>

117,2017-06-30T16:20:44.738914,Sherry,I keep getting an import error. I tried googling around and their fixes didn’t really work
117,2017-06-30T16:21:04.744646,Sherry,"it’s installed for sure, so I don’t know why I can’t import"
117,2017-06-30T16:27:57.859575,Ciera,can you do a `pip freeze`
117,2017-06-30T16:28:09.862673,Ciera,or `pip3 freeze`
117,2017-06-30T16:29:01.876989,Beula,The issue is your `pip3` is from `python 3.6` but your `python3` command is running `python 3.5`
117,2017-06-30T16:29:36.887302,Beula,"```
# from pip3 install slackclient...
Requirement already satisfied: slackclient in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages

# and from the python3 command
Python 3.5.1 (v3.5.1:37a07cee5969, Dec  5 2015, 21:12:44) 
```"
117,2017-06-30T16:29:48.890467,Beula,Execute the script with `python3.6`
117,2017-06-30T16:31:01.911579,Ciera,nice spot
117,2017-06-30T16:36:01.993005,Beula,<@Sherry> - consider using some virtualenvs to avoid this in the future :slightly_smiling_face:

117,2017-06-30T16:39:16.044543,Sherry,"ahh i figured it out, i used pip3.5, which i’ve never used before"

117,2017-06-30T16:40:31.065160,Sherry,mac!
117,2017-06-30T16:40:40.067500,Johana,on a mac i install brew and then install python2 and python3. you definitely don’t want to use system python for anything.
117,2017-06-30T16:40:55.071868,Johana,then i use penv to manage python versions and virtualenvs.
117,2017-06-30T16:41:01.073457,Sherry,ahh ok
117,2017-06-30T16:41:08.075309,Beula,"Yeah, mac is popular enough I can focus on it. Then I can learn windows :stuck_out_tongue:"
117,2017-06-30T16:41:21.078823,Beula,I'll try to do it over the weekend and it'll be free
117,2017-06-30T16:41:25.079979,Sherry,Thanks!!
117,2017-06-30T16:41:26.080242,Johana,windows you just install python from the msi.
117,2017-06-30T16:41:34.082365,Johana,and make sure you check the box to add python to the path.
117,2017-06-30T16:41:38.083655,Sherry,Yah i’m trying to install virtualenvwrapper
117,2017-06-30T16:41:41.084446,Sherry,but am getting that
117,2017-06-30T16:42:18.094145,Sherry,my virtualenvwrapper seems to be here `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`
117,2017-06-30T16:42:54.103468,Johana,your going to want to add some lines to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file.
117,2017-06-30T16:43:24.111211,Sherry,"it’s different if i’m using zsh, correct?"
117,2017-06-30T16:43:47.117156,Johana,"```
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.environments
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```"
117,2017-06-30T16:43:50.117874,Johana,something like that
117,2017-06-30T16:44:00.120472,Johana,yea you put it in your zshconfig however you have that setup.
117,2017-06-30T16:44:26.127735,Johana,i load my zsh config via my own script that i call at the end of the config zsh uses.
117,2017-06-30T16:45:12.139714,Johana,`WORKON_HOME` is the dir where all your virtualenvs are installed when you write the `mkvirutualenv` command
117,2017-06-30T16:45:56.151833,Patty,Just the last line should be sufficient 
117,2017-06-30T16:46:24.159535,Johana,i trimmed it down to those two.
117,2017-06-30T16:46:39.163499,Patty,Sorry spotty internet the rest of it popped through haha
117,2017-06-30T16:47:21.174711,Beula,"yeah, `~/.zshrc`"
117,2017-06-30T16:47:22.174788,Sherry,Done!
117,2017-06-30T16:47:24.175451,Sherry,got it
117,2017-06-30T16:47:28.176547,Beula,:thumbsup::skin-tone-4:
117,2017-06-30T16:47:38.179227,Sherry,so now no need to run this?
117,2017-06-30T16:47:42.180114,Patty,I wish more shells had bash compatibility layers like `fish` does 
117,2017-06-30T16:48:28.192269,Johana,the last two lines you paste into your shell config
117,2017-06-30T16:48:42.195978,Sherry,yup
117,2017-06-30T16:48:49.197948,Johana,you could run them yourself from the command line but that isn’t too efficient to do every time you open a terminal.
117,2017-06-30T16:48:57.200026,Sherry,ahh ok
117,2017-06-30T16:48:59.200398,Sherry,thanks!
117,2017-06-30T16:49:19.205569,Johana,if you ever use pyenv you will need to do something similar.
117,2017-06-30T16:49:22.206224,Sherry,"It’s bad practice to use folders with spaces when making the virtual environment, right?"
117,2017-06-30T16:49:26.207323,Johana,on a mac you can install that with brew. it makes everything super easy.
117,2017-06-30T16:51:50.245774,Johana,"dang, want to see how things get dated over time? this is a super simple ansible playbook for installing virtualenvwrapper from a yr ago. <https://gist.github.com/mikefromit/4281f29013fe3b4306a87cb64a2ad1fd>"
117,2017-06-30T16:52:40.259582,Sherry,"virtual environments are extremely cool, but they definitely have a learning curve to them"
117,2017-06-30T16:52:43.260359,Johana,lots of things have changed in ansible now.
117,2017-06-30T16:52:53.262872,Johana,"yea, i was a bit confused by them when i first started."
117,2017-06-30T16:53:26.271953,Johana,i was thankful for those few tutorials i found that really went through creating those.
117,2017-06-30T16:53:33.273764,Sherry,why would i want the virtual environment in the standard environment folder and not in my project folder?
117,2017-06-30T16:53:45.277048,Johana,i remember on my first projects i pushed to github i had committed my virtualenv.
117,2017-06-30T16:53:47.277600,Johana,lol
117,2017-06-30T16:54:01.281320,Johana,when you need to manage python versions.
117,2017-06-30T16:54:01.281327,Sherry,haha ouch
117,2017-06-30T16:54:12.283833,Sherry,my first push had my twitter app tokens!
117,2017-06-30T16:54:47.293375,Johana,yea that was bad. i’ve never done that but i’ve done some google hacks to look at when ppl did that.
117,2017-06-30T16:55:17.301345,Sherry,"Haha yah, luckily it was just a monitor i was setting up."
117,2017-06-30T16:55:57.311830,Johana,i ran a python script to use a custom google search with a googlehack string and then i had splunk index all the results. since the api only allowed a certain amount of calls for free I ran a cron daily.
117,2017-06-30T16:56:44.324534,Johana,i did my due diligence and contacted ppl.
117,2017-06-30T16:57:01.329042,Patty,Yeah the main problem with vanilla virtualenv is you end up with folders all over the place and management is a mess
117,2017-06-30T16:58:41.356086,Beula,If I don't use virtualenvwrapper I use pipenv or just docker (but local dev with docker on python isn't the best since you still need a local install for code completion
117,2017-06-30T16:59:26.368038,Patty,Hmm I get code completion in webstorm doing local docker dev. I mount the volume where the code is
117,2017-06-30T17:01:15.398936,Beula,"Node uses `node_modules` which is a sibling of the project, python uses `site-packages` which isn't - so my guess is that may be why"
117,2017-06-30T17:02:01.411199,Patty,Yeah was just realizing that
117,2017-06-30T17:02:20.416463,Sherry,Node is fun but callbacks are a headache haha
117,2017-06-30T17:02:32.419409,Beula,"Yeah, maybe that works - but then why bother with developing in docker?"
117,2017-06-30T17:02:47.423639,Beula,"callbacks are getting less and less common <@Sherry> , at least! :slightly_smiling_face:"
117,2017-06-30T17:03:22.432577,Patty,Current LTS of node has promises by default 
117,2017-06-30T17:03:31.434906,Patty,I'd call callbacks dead :)
117,2017-06-30T17:03:44.438201,Sherry,I’ve heard! they’re very confusing at first

117,2017-07-01T05:13:58.959534,Huong,And also clustering
118,2017-06-30T16:58:10.347727,Patty,Is pyenv still used a lot?
118,2017-06-30T17:02:17.415681,Patty,Unless you do a virtualenv in the root of the project?
119,2017-07-01T05:13:53.959160,Huong,Can someone suggest me some tutorials to help me start with data mining ?
120,2017-07-01T06:37:49.257209,Magdalena,anybody know how to intercept a form submission event? I can't seem to figure out how to target the submit event or bind a click event to the form submission button
120,2017-07-01T07:41:24.486100,Ruben,<@Magdalena> something like <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5384712/capture-a-form-submit-in-javascript> ?
121,2017-07-01T11:34:58.536911,Alba,Hey guys what are the best books to read regarding Python for fundamentals. I know for Django its two scoops
121,2017-07-01T11:36:33.545227,Ruben,<@Alba> Do you already know how to program?
121,2017-07-01T11:37:32.550317,Alba,Yeah. Looking for something more design focused and best practices
121,2017-07-01T11:37:40.551068,Alba,Currently reading idiomatic python
121,2017-07-01T11:37:47.551718,Alba,But that's more of like a skim
121,2017-07-01T11:38:18.554590,Ruben,"Ah ok. I came from C++ a long time ago, and I found the standard Python tutorial quite a good read. And I found some 'Python for C++ programmers' online texts."
121,2017-07-01T11:40:24.565305,Alba,Not a big cpp fan haha
121,2017-07-01T11:41:31.570875,Ruben,I had no choice.
121,2017-07-01T11:42:22.575029,Beula,Effective Python is good
121,2017-07-01T11:51:06.619964,Rickey,<@Alba> <http://www.allitebooks.com/fluent-python/>
121,2017-07-01T11:59:31.663580,Alba,Will take a look at both of those books :)) hopefully I can find a free download. The fluent python one is an early release
121,2017-07-01T12:08:42.716962,Alba,Meh I think the early release will be fine
121,2017-07-01T12:10:51.728748,Alba,Thank you very much <@Rickey> !
121,2017-07-01T13:36:28.175811,Rona,hola oclay que bola
121,2017-07-01T13:37:27.180721,Rona,que pasa
121,2017-07-01T13:37:48.182604,Rona,tambien eres programando del python
121,2017-07-01T14:04:06.315526,Johana,at one point in time around django 1.4 mongo was great with django but then ppl stopped maintaining some core libraries.
122,2017-07-01T12:50:39.933823,Magdalena,<@Ruben> thanks for the link! do you know if it's significantly different than if I use jquery to do this? I had trouble with targeting the correct element 
123,2017-07-01T13:59:44.292044,Odell,"Hi, I need a suggestion. I am planning to start a new project for logging user analytics using MongoDB. 
Which framework will be better to use with Mongo - Flask or Django?"
123,2017-07-01T14:03:35.312832,Johana,flask
123,2017-07-01T14:04:12.315989,Beula,+1 for that use case
123,2017-07-01T14:04:33.317857,Beula,"Though if you are doing user analytics, you may need something lower latency since that may be a ton of events"
123,2017-07-01T14:06:37.328711,Johana,i built my recent highlighter with elastic search. it worked really well. I would imagine throwing kibana on there could make for a neat analytics platform.
123,2017-07-01T14:08:28.338060,Johana,<https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>
123,2017-07-01T14:08:32.338352,Odell,<@Johana> Can you tell me more about it?
123,2017-07-01T14:09:41.344069,Johana,i’ve built an elk stack for logging at my old place of employment. it depends on what you mean by analytics :wink:.
123,2017-07-01T14:10:27.348171,Johana,you could analyze the data with scripts and use things like stochastic gradient descent and things like that or you can build dashboards.
123,2017-07-01T14:10:43.349534,Johana,not sure how you’re trying to check out these events.
123,2017-07-01T14:11:24.352768,Johana,we used the logs to determine if there were issues in the network.
123,2017-07-01T14:11:35.353580,Odell,"I will log request, pageviews and other user actions."
123,2017-07-01T14:11:54.355073,Johana,do you have any experience with flask?
123,2017-07-01T14:12:07.356231,Johana,or python web frameworks?
123,2017-07-01T14:12:30.358228,Johana,i try not to assume things.
123,2017-07-01T14:12:30.358323,Odell,Yes I've decent experience on django
123,2017-07-01T14:12:42.359309,Johana,k
123,2017-07-01T14:12:50.359850,Johana,just a sec let me bust out a code sample.
123,2017-07-01T14:13:17.362164,Odell,I can learn flask fast
123,2017-07-01T14:13:54.364922,Odell,pycharm is slow :stuck_out_tongue:
123,2017-07-01T14:15:13.371566,Johana,i also had to get my kid off of the table.
123,2017-07-01T14:16:23.377571,Odell,okay
123,2017-07-01T14:17:01.380533,Johana,for user analytics you could use django or flask. to get the user events you’ll need some sort of middleware. i’m not talking about that part. what i’m showing is how to get data into elastic search.
123,2017-07-01T14:17:33.383167,Johana,once you have data in elastic search then the kibana parts comes into play but you will also need to figure that part out.
123,2017-07-01T14:17:43.383952,Odell,ok
123,2017-07-01T14:20:46.399506,Odell,Waiting :slightly_smiling_face:
123,2017-07-01T14:21:00.400789,Johana,"ya, wondering if i should make a big gist. there are several things involved."
123,2017-07-01T14:21:49.404910,Odell,ok take your time :slightly_smiling_face:
123,2017-07-01T14:23:44.414193,Johana,dang i need to edit this in a bigger window. lol
123,2017-07-01T14:24:31.418202,Johana,"either way, in flask you’ll need to do something like that and establish a connection with elastic search."
123,2017-07-01T14:24:36.418621,Johana,when your app starts up.
123,2017-07-01T14:24:46.419408,Johana,there may be a flask-extension for it already
123,2017-07-01T14:24:59.420570,Johana,where you can simply add in the right settings.
123,2017-07-01T14:26:03.426163,Odell,ok then
123,2017-07-01T14:31:55.455871,Johana,i’ve updated it with the model. you need to create a model to describe how your document is structured.
123,2017-07-01T14:33:32.464249,Johana,oh cool. yea you can use this :smiley: <https://github.com/chiangf/Flask-Elasticsearch>
123,2017-07-01T14:35:31.473999,Odell,You used Flask + ES + Kibana?
123,2017-07-01T14:36:01.476130,Johana,no kibana
123,2017-07-01T14:36:12.476904,Johana,in my project recently.
123,2017-07-01T14:36:22.477761,Johana,my past project with ES and Kibana didn’t have flask
123,2017-07-01T14:36:46.479608,Odell,How did you build dashboard?
123,2017-07-01T14:39:31.492596,Johana,i built the dashboard with kibana.
123,2017-07-01T14:41:05.499820,Johana,flask is only involved in this process b/c it’s generating the event.
123,2017-07-01T14:41:41.502529,Johana,i’m just showing how to save data to elastic search in python with a flask view. once you have data in EL then you can use Kibana to do analytics. Kibana could be installed on a totally different server.
123,2017-07-01T14:42:48.507696,Johana,hmm.. i could probably PR this elastic search model code i have with this flask extension.
123,2017-07-01T14:42:58.508397,Johana,it’s nice mapping a document to a class.
123,2017-07-01T14:43:29.510865,Odell,"Yeah, that will be nice."
123,2017-07-01T14:44:07.513666,Johana,i know it’s a lot of pieces there and gaps but you get started down the path you will get each working :wink:.
123,2017-07-01T14:44:43.516799,Odell,i've few questions.
123,2017-07-01T14:45:05.518760,Johana,k
123,2017-07-01T14:46:19.524894,Odell,"Can you tell me about the architecture part, or process flow."
123,2017-07-01T14:48:21.534422,Odell,"Is it something like this - 
1. User creates an event.
2. Flask view logs data in ES.
3. Kibana gets data from ES and shows it in dashboard."
123,2017-07-01T14:48:58.537167,Odell,Aren't you using any async tasks queues like rabbitmq or kafka?
123,2017-07-01T14:59:23.585652,Johana,you could but in the most basic sense you would use the middleware to do a post on elastic search with the data about the event.
123,2017-07-01T15:01:08.595267,Odell,"I found this blog post for similar usecase - <http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/|engineering.hackerearth.com/2015/02/26/logging-millions-requests-what-it-takes/>
They used kafka + rabittmq + mongodb + S3 + redshift to build complete architecture"
123,2017-07-01T15:01:53.598921,Odell,ES will be better than this?
123,2017-07-01T15:04:54.613805,Johana,"oh idk about that. i haven’t used all those before. what i proposed was for something simpler but it could grow to using those things once you need “web scale”. hence, the “logging millions of requests everyday”."
123,2017-07-01T15:09:12.634770,Odell,"okay, thanks :slightly_smiling_face: Now I should connect the dots using the code you provided."
123,2017-07-01T15:10:09.639229,Odell,"One quick question, how many servers u used? What will be minimal cost to setup this?"
123,2017-07-01T15:10:25.640710,Johana,"yea, i’m thinking i may need to do an example app for this now."
123,2017-07-01T15:11:37.646473,Johana,do you already have a site you’re trying to integrate this into?
123,2017-07-01T15:11:52.647626,Johana,or your just interested in getting it going on your own site?
123,2017-07-01T15:13:09.653608,Odell,I want to integrate it to a website running on Django.
123,2017-07-01T15:13:50.657035,Johana,<https://qbox.io/blog/how-to-elasticsearch-python-django-part1>
123,2017-07-01T15:16:50.671127,Odell,cost involved?
123,2017-07-01T15:17:40.675100,Johana,oh idk the cost we had our own vm infrastructure.
123,2017-07-01T15:18:00.676559,Odell,How many VMs you used?
123,2017-07-01T15:21:54.695007,Johana,there was a central server that ran logstash and the elastic search server with kibana so 2 servers. we also had another server running OSSEC.
123,2017-07-01T15:22:51.699604,Johana,it’s been a few years now. i’ve slept since then and don’t remember all the details as i’m not involved in networking admin anymore.
123,2017-07-01T15:23:25.702175,Johana,<https://qbox.io/blog/welcome-to-the-elk-stack-elasticsearch-logstash-kibana>
123,2017-07-01T15:24:13.705584,Johana,i remember our biggest problem was storage.
123,2017-07-01T15:24:29.707026,Johana,there was also grokking all the different kinds of logs.
123,2017-07-01T15:27:04.718901,Johana,the one big gripe about ES is that it’s easy to get data in there but hard to take it back out. to combat this while you save a document for EL to index you can also create a record in a relational db. this will help for other kinds of reporting.
123,2017-07-01T15:29:33.729959,Johana,for logs we didn’t care about the relational db part. we needed to analyze them in real-time and then archive them.
123,2017-07-01T15:30:24.734155,Johana,you can also get ES running super quick with docker.
123,2017-07-01T15:30:39.735532,Odell,Why RDBMS and not MongoDB?
123,2017-07-01T15:32:07.742410,Johana,well ES is already a document store. using something like Mongo would be redundant but i guess if you wanted to you could.
123,2017-07-01T15:34:15.752811,Johana,it’s generally not a good idea to try and do things a relational database can do in a document database like joins. i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdms at the same time. this won’t be needed for every application.
123,2017-07-01T15:34:54.755882,Johana,"this is my docker-compose.yml for ES:
```
version: '3'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: nickstenning/elasticsearch-icu
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:9200:9200'
```

you can type `docker-compose up` and it will start the service for you."
123,2017-07-01T15:36:21.762760,Odell,"So I should store data in both, ES and RDBMS if I want to access it frequently?"
123,2017-07-01T15:37:02.766205,Johana,i don’t know what you should do b/c i don’t know the requirements i was just letting you know what you could do :wink:
123,2017-07-01T15:37:31.768579,Johana,&gt; i suggested saving to a rdbms in the process mainly so you can take advantage of an rdbms at the same time. this won’t be needed for every application.
123,2017-07-01T15:41:19.786309,Odell,"Hmm. By storing document in RDBMS, did you mean creating schema based on keys in document?"
123,2017-07-01T15:42:50.792964,Johana,"yea, you can save the data to the db and get back from the database the inserted record. That would look like this maybe `{""id"": 1, ""name"": ""a1gupta"", ""role"": ""1"", ""created_on"": ""2017-10-11 343434""}`. once you get what the database has you send it to ES."
123,2017-07-01T15:45:17.803900,Johana,that’s how you would make a search engine with ES btw. which is what i did recently. you can take those same values in the dict and pass them as query params to a search endpoint.
123,2017-07-01T15:51:04.830247,Odell,Thanks <@Johana> . I think I should start now to understand it better. :upside_down_face:
123,2017-07-01T15:52:06.834759,Johana,code it the way you see it :smiley: it looks like there may be a few problems to solve before getting to ES like getting the events you want.
123,2017-07-01T15:52:25.836258,Johana,i’m sure there are some django plugins that can help you with that.
123,2017-07-01T16:12:03.927764,Johana,ppl in the <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channel would know.
124,2017-07-01T21:15:32.046642,Elane,"I have something seemingly complex and puzzling. I’m trying to add dynamic localization to my library which also powers a REST API. I was able to add the gettext _() function by running this at my root before importing the other modules

```
LOCALE = os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), 'locale')
gettext.install('app, LOCALE)

from app import foo, bar
```

That works great. However, I want to add dynamic localization for certain functions. Ex:

```
# Using system
foo()
# Using given locale
foo(lang='es')
# Goes back to system
foo()
```

I’m trying to do this by running within a context switcher:

```
@contextmanager
def set_language(lang: str=None):
    # Set language
    if not lang is None:
        gettext.translation('app', LOCALE, languages=[lang], fallback=True).install()
    yield
    # Revert to system default
    gettext.install('app', LOCALE)

def foo(lang: str=None):
    with set_language(lang):
        print(_('Foo the bar'))
```

But I’m getting this opaque error and can’t figure out how to isolate it

```
print(_('Foo the Bar'))
TypeError: 'bool' object is not callable
```

The interesting part is that it works on the first call to foo but not the second. My guess is that something is going on after the `yield` which screws the system up, but I’m not sure where, why, or how to ask the right question"
124,2017-07-02T00:17:08.596109,Elane,"OH MY GOD. I’ve been testing this in the REPL. I have a function which returns a boolean that gets “thrown away”, but the REPL assigns it to `_` which overwrites the global `_` set by `gettext.install()`"

125,2017-07-02T11:19:14.814640,Georgeann,`append` to the list...for sure...now try
125,2017-07-02T11:22:52.831205,Deedee,"So there can be multiple `{'10.01.2005': {'issue': ['important1', 'important2'], 'url': ['url1', '<http://google.com>']}}` ?"
125,2017-07-02T11:23:23.833359,Georgeann,all. tired better not to sit at the computer. go to the beach.
125,2017-07-02T11:23:33.833974,Deedee,"so if important3 and url3 came in, there are different ""10.01.2005"" that it can go into?"

everything is very easy.))"
125,2017-07-02T11:34:16.882325,Deedee,"I don't think you can use a dictionary for this. Hopefully someone else can confirm, but I think you're looking at using a list instead."
125,2017-07-02T11:38:26.899961,Suellen,z[date]['issue'] is probably a list
126,2017-07-02T10:58:52.720788,Deedee,"and the date stay the same? So Jan 5, 2017 would have two {url_result, issue} sets?"

the third has no common poles with the first two.
the `merge` would be for the first and second if I understand correctly.
But why? And so they're fine."
131,2017-07-03T04:07:23.990292,Suellen,"Due to having no common columns and no index, the third df is just appended to the end"
131,2017-07-03T04:07:58.002050,Suellen,df.merge will merge the third df and the big one despite no common data between them

132,2017-07-03T07:57:38.644476,Ciera,that's not a silly question. It's the id of your bot that slack return when you use <https://api.slack.com/methods/rtm.connect>
132,2017-07-03T07:58:21.658066,Ciera,or `rtm.start` it's useful to filter message coming from your bot
132,2017-07-03T07:58:53.667702,Ciera,but normally they shouldn't need it as they can easily retrieve it for you
132,2017-07-03T09:10:42.222475,Ciera,yes. you can add a `finally` if you want a piece of code to always be executed
132,2017-07-03T09:11:47.248863,Ciera,it depends on the what but in some case it can overlapp yes
133,2017-07-03T09:09:51.201023,Susann,this is a pretty basic questions - but when an exception is thrown the rest of the code after where the exception occurred is not executed unless it was handled in a `try` `except`?
133,2017-07-03T09:10:38.220468,Susann,"I'm deciding whether I should test code with a context manager of an object that throws an exception, although I don't think I am correct in the what happens"
133,2017-07-03T09:12:40.271046,Susann,"so let's say that's the code and we're expecting a new_object to be created based on the paramteters, but an exception can occur like a URLError or something"
133,2017-07-03T09:12:52.275601,Susann,what I'm trying to do is test the correct exception is thrown/handled
133,2017-07-03T09:12:56.277393,Susann,so I was thinking...
133,2017-07-03T09:15:32.341793,Suellen,`as new_object` looks strange to me
133,2017-07-03T09:15:48.348469,Ciera,If you are testing code I believe both pytest and unitest have special context manager to test errors
133,2017-07-03T09:15:54.351171,Suellen,"just do
```
with self.assertRaises(URLError):
    new_object = NewObject(param_to_cause_exception)
```"
133,2017-07-03T09:15:59.353128,Susann,yah that is unittest
133,2017-07-03T09:16:03.355190,Suellen,"also, don't test anything else in this function"
133,2017-07-03T09:16:17.360894,Suellen,you're testing only the fact that wrong URL causes an exception
133,2017-07-03T09:16:33.367359,Ciera,in that case if the assert is correct the test will continue as expected
133,2017-07-03T09:16:36.368569,Susann,with the `as new_object` I can pass it through the rest of the code as an exception object which I found here<https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises>
133,2017-07-03T09:16:41.370825,Ciera,but <@Suellen> make a good point
133,2017-07-03T09:17:03.379866,Ciera,oh ok. You want to test what is in the exception ?
133,2017-07-03T09:17:04.380404,Susann,thanks <@Suellen> that does make sense
133,2017-07-03T09:17:08.381833,Susann,right
133,2017-07-03T09:17:25.388958,Susann,and how the rest of the code responds to that <@Ciera> if that makes sense
133,2017-07-03T09:17:45.397414,Ciera,both object have the same name that's a little confusing
133,2017-07-03T09:18:21.412151,Ciera,you can interact with the exception after the `with` like any other object. For example to check what's inside
133,2017-07-03T09:18:39.419348,Susann,"right, check error codes and such"
133,2017-07-03T09:19:07.431535,Susann,I think I was incorrectly thinking of how the object would be handled if an exception was thrown (not under test)
133,2017-07-03T09:19:31.441423,Susann,in my test I am asserting the correct exception is thrown given a bad parameter
133,2017-07-03T09:20:20.461799,Susann,I think I've got it from here thanks guys <@Suellen> :taco: <@Ciera> :taco:
133,2017-07-03T09:20:59.478376,Susann,I think I just gave you guys 2 tacos each but you guys were great so keep 'em

134,2017-07-03T09:42:13.039564,Mariano,Best way to order a list based on another list?
134,2017-07-03T09:44:53.110885,Ciera,there is something like `sorted()`
134,2017-07-03T09:45:13.120118,Ciera,and I guess you can pass like a lambda to do custom sort
134,2017-07-03T09:49:16.231300,Suellen,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; order = ['b', 'c', 'a']
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(['a', 'b', 'c'], key=order.index)
['b', 'c', 'a']
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
```"
134,2017-07-03T09:49:31.238066,Mariano,yeah <@Vada> helped me on the django channel. btw have a :taco:
134,2017-07-03T09:51:03.279211,Vada,<@Suellen> :taco: I missed that you could just provide order.index instead of a full on lambda. This will be much better

135,2017-07-03T13:59:16.231327,Suellen,Or should it be the whole domain name?
135,2017-07-03T13:59:55.243267,Ciera,this will point `www.my_awesome_website` to the same IP as `c.storage....`
135,2017-07-03T14:00:06.247203,Ciera,no you don't need to put the whole name
135,2017-07-03T14:00:15.250585,Suellen,so this should work :confused:
135,2017-07-03T14:00:21.252414,Ciera,yes

137,2017-07-03T16:15:56.467859,Elin,"On my machine, at the moment, at the same folder as my python script, and I want to store the photos in a subfolder."
137,2017-07-03T16:16:42.478729,Beula,"Oh, okay. Yeah, you should be able to just move them and `os.path.join`"

1. about `map` vs `as_completed`, if I dont care for the result order, I should use `as_completed` right?
2. If I use `map`, then even my 2nd job finished earlier than the 1st, my executor still wait for the 1st to finished then push new job to the executor?"
137,2017-07-04T05:55:21.485200,Kymberly,<@Gabriele>  I am thinking it might be due to missing dependencies for the `checksum` def. But I am not sure how to check that as the logs dont help much

140,2017-07-04T08:43:42.663341,Mariano,Linux. I'm using crontabs on django-beat
140,2017-07-04T08:44:10.672856,Mariano,I haven't found a way to do that using a crontab
140,2017-07-04T08:44:28.678962,Ciera,there must be :stuck_out_tongue:
140,2017-07-04T08:45:29.700472,Mariano,I have seen some hacking with bash but i think i don't have that available
140,2017-07-04T08:45:36.702881,Mariano,just a plain crontab
140,2017-07-04T08:45:41.704763,Suellen,don't have shell? how?

140,2017-07-04T08:46:26.720959,Ciera,it seems you need a small bash script indeed
140,2017-07-04T08:47:34.744685,Mariano,The crontab is ran by a scheduler built with on top of celery. Introducing the equivalent to the bash script will involve too much hacking i think
140,2017-07-04T08:49:16.780080,Mariano,meh. I'll just run the script every sunday (well they are celery tasks). And have the task checking if it's on the week that i want
140,2017-07-04T08:50:19.802176,Ciera,that should be the easiest
140,2017-07-04T08:50:45.810883,Mariano,I saw that the weekdays and the day of the month are an `or` proposition on crontabs
140,2017-07-04T08:51:23.824328,Ciera,I imiagne you could also run it only between the 7 and the 14 and only check if it's sunday
140,2017-07-04T08:51:56.835650,Ciera,more like 7 - 13 :stuck_out_tongue:
140,2017-07-04T08:52:25.846165,Mariano,That too. Or run it every sunday and check if it's between 7 and 14. I think this option will run less unnecessary times. There isn't much load on the system that i'm building so it doesn't matter

144,2017-07-05T07:48:18.134370,Lamont,Hi peeps. What is the most state-of-art machine learning technique or research project on learning langauge?
144,2017-07-05T07:49:51.162369,Lamont,*language (clearly i have a reason for my research)
144,2017-07-05T07:50:01.165577,Gabriele,What do you mean by 'learning language'? This is a VERY wide field
144,2017-07-05T07:50:36.176167,Gabriele,Are you familiar with word2vec? It's not the 'most' state of the art but it represented a big step forward a few years ago and is widely used
144,2017-07-05T07:51:11.186827,Gabriele,"(You might also reach a more specific audience in <#C2J4B66PK|machine_learning> , but there are fewer people there)"
144,2017-07-05T09:42:17.014760,Hyman,"Hello guys, I got a huge problem"
144,2017-07-05T09:43:06.041789,Jacinta,"Cool, thanks! No worries, biking and grilling should always take precedence."
144,2017-07-05T09:45:13.112852,Hyman,OK bro here it comes
144,2017-07-05T09:45:14.112979,Meg,"someone will read it and say something, but you need to put your issue out first"
144,2017-07-05T09:48:11.212889,Hyman,There is a website and a WiFi network. And what i want to do is to automatically connect any person on my WiFi to the website without theme authenticate themselves directly on the website
144,2017-07-05T09:48:42.229822,Gabriele,"Simple, flippant answer: disable authentication on your website"
144,2017-07-05T09:51:00.308289,Hyman,"No no, that isn't that. Persons on my WiFi can connect themselves but those out of it need to authenticate themselves"
144,2017-07-05T09:51:11.314495,Meg,do you have a static IP?
144,2017-07-05T09:51:29.324583,Hyman,"No, no static IP"
144,2017-07-05T09:51:32.326487,Meg,then sorry
144,2017-07-05T09:51:57.340552,Meg,"if you had a static IP through your ISP, then you could check the IP address on the incoming request"
144,2017-07-05T09:52:16.351735,Meg,and then filter to authentication if necessary
144,2017-07-05T09:54:05.415093,Beula,"If you're on a Windows domain you can do more, but that's a bit specialized"
144,2017-07-05T09:54:07.416224,Junita,can you run custom code on the wifi router?  you might be able to have it regularly send its ip
144,2017-07-05T09:54:55.444267,Junita,"when it updates you might have a moment where the site isn’t accessible, but it might do the trick."
144,2017-07-05T09:58:26.570469,Hyman,My problem now is to authenticate a person from it's IP address since I don't want to change even the website code
144,2017-07-05T09:58:54.587670,Meg,why?
144,2017-07-05T09:59:30.609021,Meg,"ok, better step back and describe things in more detail"
144,2017-07-05T09:59:56.625452,Meg,because it sounds like you're trying to do some things that are not advisable
144,2017-07-05T10:01:20.679291,Patty,"and depending on how secure you want this, IP whitelisting may not be the best bet"
144,2017-07-05T10:01:41.692258,Meg,"since you can spoof and use VPNs, and more"
144,2017-07-05T10:02:13.711202,Gabriele,"Have the site listen on 2 network interfaces, one inward-facing to your network, one outward-facing to the internet, and the inward facing one can use different auth criteria"
144,2017-07-05T10:06:13.854510,Hyman,<@Meg> Let me explain it more detailly
144,2017-07-05T10:08:49.945315,Hyman,"There is a website that I am setting up and i want to grant direct access to persons i a given location that is persons connected to my WiFi. If a person is connected to my WiFi, he can access the website with no problem, but if he is not in my WiFi, he should enter a passcode before proceeding to the site's content"
144,2017-07-05T10:09:35.973060,Meg,why do you want to have such a huge hole in your authentication
144,2017-07-05T10:09:45.979537,Meg,just have them sign in
144,2017-07-05T10:09:55.985855,Meg,and keep a session cookie active for them
144,2017-07-05T10:10:08.993222,Meg,"and so when they re-access the site, their login session is still active"
144,2017-07-05T10:10:48.017739,Gabriele,"I've seen this sort of thing done before to facilitate company intranets, and that's done primarily just by virtue of listening on an inward-facing network address. But sometimes there is still extra auth anyway, because it's not a great hardship."
144,2017-07-05T10:10:52.019900,Junita,Is it the case that it’s irrelevant *who* the user is that accesses content?  i.e. there is no user data specific to a user?
144,2017-07-05T10:11:00.024588,Gabriele,...also that.
144,2017-07-05T10:11:33.044988,Junita,"if it’s truly irrelevant who people are, then yeah, I’d combine <@Gabriele>’s comment with a VPN from the wifi router to the network that second interface is on"
144,2017-07-05T10:14:20.144598,Meg,not a bad suggestion
144,2017-07-05T10:14:31.151427,Meg,<@Hyman> do you have the expertise to do this?
145,2017-07-05T09:44:56.103116,Meg,<@Hyman> best to say your problem
145,2017-07-05T10:09:19.963533,Meg,why?
146,2017-07-05T12:26:46.012992,Ciera,what's the best way to join on a string x time the same value ?
146,2017-07-05T12:27:21.031794,Ciera,"like `', '.join('hello' for _ in my_list)`"
146,2017-07-05T12:27:56.051458,Ciera,But it seems a bit overkill
146,2017-07-05T12:30:25.134085,Jodie,<@Ciera>: is there a better way than that?
146,2017-07-05T12:31:05.155950,Meg,`'hello ' * n`
146,2017-07-05T12:31:21.164789,Meg,where `n` is the number of times to repeat
146,2017-07-05T12:31:49.179886,Shelly,But won't it add a space at the end?
146,2017-07-05T12:32:07.190037,Ciera,that does each letter <@Meg>
146,2017-07-05T12:32:26.201189,Ciera,"can do that `('hello',) * n`"
146,2017-07-05T12:34:11.257152,Ciera,I completly missed your point <@Meg> in fact :smile:
146,2017-07-05T12:34:14.258520,Ciera,got it
146,2017-07-05T12:34:35.269652,Vada,I feel the original was good enough tbh
146,2017-07-05T12:35:21.294476,Shelly,Wait. Got it :ok_hand:@ndevox
146,2017-07-05T12:36:48.340674,Ciera,I hoped something existed for that. I'll stay with the for loop more readable
147,2017-07-05T12:34:25.264444,Vada,"`('hello, ' * n).strip(', ')`?"

150,2017-07-05T14:41:32.364871,Patty,<@Sherry> is this what you ask for help with here?
150,2017-07-05T14:42:18.389181,Beula,"He asked about SSL, I thought - what are you seeing for captcha?"

150,2017-07-05T14:44:06.444637,Beula,"Oh. Yeah, the community is generally against enabling breaking TOS or anything Illegal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
150,2017-07-05T14:46:03.506473,Patty,"its a big grey area, so, yeah"
150,2017-07-05T14:52:27.714100,Sherry,What? I asked for help with setting up a SSL certificate that has nothing to do with a sneaker group..
150,2017-07-05T14:53:58.763276,Beula,I think it's more the soliciting DMs for help and such
150,2017-07-05T14:54:29.780042,Sherry,"Ah, okay. He’s the one who asked if I needed a dev, but there’s not really a need right now."
150,2017-07-05T14:54:36.783631,Sherry,No worries though
150,2017-07-05T14:56:58.859514,Beula,"Okay, generally speaking - the group would prefer to not be used for anything gray-area or illegal, whether DM, public, or private channels"

154,2017-07-06T11:02:03.326225,Franklyn,Question about unit testing and type hinting - is there a simple way to assert that a function call returns a certain type and that there are no other type warnings if return types have already been hinted in the function signature?
154,2017-07-06T11:07:36.544459,Suellen,mypy probably
154,2017-07-06T11:08:36.581793,Suellen,It's pretty intelligent in type inferring
154,2017-07-06T11:32:54.517635,Franklyn,is it possible to run nosetests with mypy?
155,2017-07-06T12:31:25.638024,Mei,anyone have any recommendations on best ways to test flask api’s?  I am writing an api in flask and want to do unittests on it but not sure the best way to do it with flask
155,2017-07-06T12:31:58.656412,Signe,do you want unit tests or integration tests?
155,2017-07-06T12:32:27.672734,Mei,"well this is all sorta new to me as far as testing goes I haven’t done it much in the past but I want to mainly ensure the code works and get back proper responses, etc"
155,2017-07-06T12:32:30.674609,Mei,since its basically a bot
155,2017-07-06T12:32:56.689057,Signe,"So there are various levels of testing. If you want a lot of confidence, you should do `end-to-end` testing"
155,2017-07-06T12:33:19.702107,Signe,"which basically means you spin up your app, then use `requests` to hit the api's and check that they actually work"
155,2017-07-06T12:33:48.717638,Signe,"an integration test would be just calling the handler, not using http. And a unit test would only check the logic of one function alone, as in, the function where the logic is"
155,2017-07-06T12:34:20.735734,Mei,yea basically the end to end is what I want
155,2017-07-06T12:34:31.741726,Mei,take the code spin up the flask app and make calls to the routes to verify they work
155,2017-07-06T12:34:36.744757,Mei,"before it deploys the code to heroku, etc"
155,2017-07-06T12:34:51.753105,Mei,so this will be a part of my jenkins setup
155,2017-07-06T12:35:00.758185,Mei,I’ve never done testing in the past lol need to learn how to integrate it into my projects
155,2017-07-06T12:36:49.818363,Signe,"Unfortunantly I dont know of any ""api testing frameworks"" in python"
155,2017-07-06T12:36:59.823914,Mei,its more of how do I test flask
155,2017-07-06T12:37:00.824193,Signe,but its really not very hard to just write tests that use requests
155,2017-07-06T12:37:03.825694,Mei,since its a flask app
155,2017-07-06T12:37:03.825756,Signe,and call your app
155,2017-07-06T12:37:12.830599,Mei,yea if thats all it is I guess I can do that
155,2017-07-06T12:37:23.836491,Signe,You also might want to look at: <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/testing/>
155,2017-07-06T12:37:31.841026,Signe,or ask more questions in <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>
155,2017-07-06T12:37:31.841034,Mei,"I was more curious how I test it and where for example where do I spin up the code and test it or does it just do it all local, etc"
155,2017-07-06T12:37:45.848341,Mei,yea I’ve been looking over that doc
155,2017-07-06T12:38:13.863337,Mei,"problem is that one is very db driven and I’m not even using a db yet, just want to test simple flask routes, maybe I’ll just go the route of requests"
155,2017-07-06T12:38:33.874752,Mei,"I’ll see what I can find, thanks"
155,2017-07-06T12:38:45.881340,Signe,if you dont have a DB then ignore the DB code
155,2017-07-06T12:38:53.886133,Signe,the rest will still work
155,2017-07-06T12:40:18.933650,Mei,yea thats why I’m checking it out just wasn’t sure if there was anything else or if this is the only info I’ve asked in flask too
155,2017-07-06T12:40:22.935858,Mei,didn’t realize they had a channel
156,2017-07-06T13:49:16.222131,Meg,code review help: package all html file keys from a S3 bucket with a provided prefix into a list
156,2017-07-06T13:51:32.298038,Meg,"so, I have a bunch of websites scraped and archived on S3"
156,2017-07-06T13:51:45.305542,Meg,"I want to get the key names for the html files only, for indexing in solr"
156,2017-07-06T13:52:07.317617,Meg,"this is the naive solution, and while it works, I think it could be improved.  Any options?"
156,2017-07-06T13:54:53.410526,Shelly,"i think you can use map, Not sure if it would improve the code"
156,2017-07-06T13:55:11.420779,Patty,"could change line 12 to be `for item in page.get('Contents', []):` or whatever empty iterable you want"
156,2017-07-06T13:55:13.421717,Patty,saves a line
156,2017-07-06T13:56:54.480064,Shelly,"Similarly `if item.get('Key', '').endswith('htm') or item.get('Key', '').endswith('html'):`"
156,2017-07-06T13:58:34.539053,Meg,I thought of that
156,2017-07-06T13:58:41.543241,Meg,but feel the readability is so-so
156,2017-07-06T13:59:09.559372,Patty,yeah gets a little overly verbose there
156,2017-07-06T14:00:09.595476,Shelly,"Well, I tried :slightly_smiling_face:"
156,2017-07-06T14:00:59.625727,Beula,"I like `any(key.endswith(x) for x in ['html', 'htm']):` so you can arbitrarily add more extensions if you want"
156,2017-07-06T14:01:09.631327,Beula,"but neither is ""right"" or better"
156,2017-07-06T14:01:38.648081,Shelly,I like this one
156,2017-07-06T14:04:54.760744,Meg,"alright, thanks"
156,2017-07-06T14:05:12.770400,Meg,It was the nested looping and checks that I was unsure about
156,2017-07-06T14:05:23.776778,Meg,wanted to be sure I wasn't missing something more pythonic
156,2017-07-06T14:07:45.858107,Shelly,You never know what Python has up in its sleeve
156,2017-07-06T14:52:53.377735,Patty,<@Meg> now flatten all of the loops into a one-liner
156,2017-07-06T14:54:12.422699,Meg,do that only if you want to be a clever bastard and screw with the people taking over after you :smile:
156,2017-07-06T14:54:49.443467,Patty,generating DELETE statements from a dictionary that came from a csv lol
156,2017-07-06T14:54:57.447714,Meg,:facepalm:
156,2017-07-06T14:55:02.451037,Patty,i flattened it for funsies
156,2017-07-06T14:55:11.455841,Meg,showoff
156,2017-07-06T14:55:19.459975,Meg,:smile:
156,2017-07-06T14:55:19.460437,Patty,it was a one-off script ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
156,2017-07-06T14:55:29.465646,Patty,the actual code i think is on my other machine
156,2017-07-06T14:55:30.466026,Meg,don't you mean off-by-one?
156,2017-07-06T14:55:35.469138,Meg,:smile:
156,2017-07-06T14:55:42.473347,Patty,don’t you mean off-by-one?

158,2017-07-06T15:17:23.165108,Hyman,Hello guys
158,2017-07-06T15:18:16.191790,Hyman,How can I implement a Single Sign on system for persons connected to a WiFi
158,2017-07-06T15:28:35.504478,Meg,this the same thing you were asking about the other day?
158,2017-07-06T15:35:25.712829,Ressie,<@Hyman> what kinda of enviroment do you have for wifi.
158,2017-07-06T15:35:58.729431,Ressie,<@Hyman> define single sing on.  To my network ears that sounds like 802.11x
158,2017-07-06T15:36:12.736206,Ressie,for your needs
159,2017-07-06T16:14:43.923567,Meg,"got a celery question here.

I have a master task, for lack of a better word, that takes in a list of URLs and chunks it up to an appropriate number of sub-tasks to execute for indexing in a solr server

I'd like to be able to record in the model record for that particular instance _how_ many URLs were successfully indexed.  But as the sub-tasks are executing asynchronously, with no feedback to the parent task, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to update the db on completion of the last sub-task."
159,2017-07-06T16:15:33.948592,Meg,Only thing I can think of is for each subtask to increment/update the db record on completion.  Is there a more elegant way to do this with Celery?
159,2017-07-06T16:17:14.999028,Beula,"I don't think that is too inelegant, but you could have the parent task get all results of the subtasks by polling them and do it that way - not sure it's much more elegant though"
159,2017-07-06T16:18:38.040577,Meg,"yeah, agreed"
159,2017-07-06T16:18:47.045405,Meg,thats about what I was thinking as well
159,2017-07-06T16:19:08.056148,Meg,but its pretty necessary for the parent and child tasks to be on different queues
159,2017-07-06T16:21:49.139479,Lamonica,Anyone have experience trying to persist CloudSearch/Elasticsearch search results? I am working on a system that maps document ids to search queries so relational data can be added in an RDS. However because documents AND search queries can be edited you need to routinely re-run the search to see if new documents need to be added in the mapping table or delete the outdated ones and the runtime is just going to grow as documents and saved search queries are added.
159,2017-07-06T16:23:17.185332,Beula,<@Meg> - I don't think which queue they run on matters for getting a result
159,2017-07-06T16:23:36.195269,Meg,<@Beula> I have to think about the queue and workers getting clogged up
159,2017-07-06T16:23:54.204737,Beula,"yeah, so the master task blocking them will cause issues"
159,2017-07-06T16:23:58.206610,Meg,correct
159,2017-07-06T16:24:10.212832,Meg,"thus, the different queues"
159,2017-07-06T16:24:30.223709,Beula,It would only block on 1 worker
159,2017-07-06T16:24:54.235907,Beula,"But yeah, in that case - DB increment seems like the option"
159,2017-07-06T16:25:52.266616,Meg,"alright, thanks"
159,2017-07-06T16:26:26.284471,Meg,nice to know I'm on the right track :slightly_smiling_face:
159,2017-07-06T16:26:44.293746,Beula,<@Collette> - any other thoughts :point_up::skin-tone-4: ?
159,2017-07-06T16:26:48.295752,Meg,"nobody else here uses python or the tools I use, so its good to get confirmation"
159,2017-07-06T16:27:06.305026,Meg,he's probably sleeping right now
159,2017-07-06T16:27:16.310296,Meg,but woould be interested in his and <@Patty>'s feedback as well
159,2017-07-06T16:27:27.316764,Beula,"I thought they had an on-done callback option, but I am not seeing it"

159,2017-07-06T16:29:38.385340,Patty,"ill catch up in a few, fire at work"
159,2017-07-06T16:29:41.387029,Patty,not a literal fire
159,2017-07-06T16:29:54.393667,Meg,"ok, good luck"
159,2017-07-06T16:29:59.396491,Meg,need some marshmallows?
159,2017-07-06T16:30:12.403580,Beula,literal fire by my mountain house :disappointed: may cancel my bike trip :cry:
159,2017-07-06T16:30:20.408445,Meg,whoops
159,2017-07-06T16:30:28.412467,Meg,colorado
159,2017-07-06T16:30:31.413992,Patty,no its someone using RUBY of all things spamming us with bad requests
159,2017-07-06T16:30:33.415305,Meg,snowbound seven months of the year
159,2017-07-06T16:30:41.419476,Meg,the rest you're bone dry
159,2017-07-06T16:30:54.426790,Meg,<@Beula> having fun with Joe's API?
159,2017-07-06T16:30:55.427182,Meg,:smile:

159,2017-07-06T16:31:09.434332,Beula,Can ruby run fast enough to spam it?
159,2017-07-06T16:31:22.441315,Meg,eventually
159,2017-07-06T16:31:35.448803,Meg,probably not DDOS level of spam though
159,2017-07-06T16:31:46.454342,Meg,like the one that took down kreb's blog
159,2017-07-06T16:31:55.459249,Beula,"oh yeah, that was crazy"
159,2017-07-06T16:32:04.463970,Beula,"that was the IoT hack, IIRC"
159,2017-07-06T16:32:20.473003,Meg,yep
159,2017-07-06T16:32:34.480429,Meg,"well, I'm out"
159,2017-07-06T16:32:43.485262,Meg,time to get home and head out on the bike for a bit
159,2017-07-06T16:32:59.493926,Meg,good evening/night/morning!
159,2017-07-06T16:45:59.894541,Patty,we have a really bad customer that spams us a lot with bad requests and they seem to do it scripted and its 400 400 400 400 and they dont handle errors in their scripts so it just keeps going
159,2017-07-06T16:47:00.925435,Patty,<@Meg> I was going to suggest `on_success` with a handler to write results to the db
159,2017-07-06T16:49:46.010520,Patty,"you could also get the values from calling it e.g.,: ```
result = task.apply_async(*args, **kwargs)
result.collect() # after processing is complete this list grows```"
159,2017-07-06T16:50:12.023184,Patty,<http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/reference/celery.result.html>
160,2017-07-06T16:45:09.868651,Patty,no ruby cant DDOS aws im sure :stuck_out_tongue:
160,2017-07-06T16:46:05.897879,Patty,:facepalm:
160,2017-07-06T16:52:46.100471,Patty,"personally i prefer `on_success`, however i would then make sure that if there is an error that you handle responding with either how many were indexed, or bail the whole indexing out (probably not this because lol solr reindexing speeds)"
160,2017-07-06T16:53:09.112236,Patty,or you can consider ANY indexing a “success” and still use `on_success`
160,2017-07-06T16:53:19.117507,Patty,"man, i miss my job where i did a ton of celery and solr"
161,2017-07-06T17:39:17.384827,Meg,"Yeah, I'll probably do that in the master task, combined with polling of the subtasks. When the subtasks complete, the master will finish as well, and then can handle success, failure, etc"
161,2017-07-06T17:46:43.561141,Beula,Oh so Joe suggests it and now it's okay the master task blocks! table flip /s
162,2017-07-06T18:01:06.895541,Sherry,Is abort() not a flask function anymore?

164,2017-07-06T20:31:59.332900,Sherry,"Hi again, I have a flask app that I am running that is collecting real time slack data from my slack server. I am appending messages to a list (i’m using RTM in python) and need my flask app to constantly allow get requests to view the messages. I am having a hard time figuring out threading with flask. Are there any good guides to do so?"
164,2017-07-06T20:53:43.591560,Mariano,Try using some type of caching system like redis. Every flask request lives in it's own thread. So communication between them can be hard and i think it's not recommended
164,2017-07-06T20:54:01.595136,Mariano,try to use something like `redis` to store that list

166,2017-07-07T00:54:34.058089,Signe,"If someone has a question i dont quite know the answer too, i try to find it, mainly for me. But then once i do, i get tacos, sometimes"
166,2017-07-07T00:55:00.062231,Signe,Im here to learn what i dont know that i dont know
166,2017-07-07T00:55:33.067437,Shelly,"<@Signe> I think we should have a digress bot, which warns when chatters are going out of channel topic area."
166,2017-07-07T00:55:57.071084,Signe,Is that a hint to me ;) im always guilty of that
166,2017-07-07T00:55:58.071270,Deedee,1/2 of those tacos are from me in the 2 wks I've been here. :laughing:
166,2017-07-07T00:56:13.073346,Deedee,I PUT YOU ALL ON THE MAP!
166,2017-07-07T00:56:13.073362,Signe,You sent me 100+ tacos?
166,2017-07-07T00:56:51.079273,Shelly,"<@Signe> Wasn't hinting anyone, just a random thought. Should have been on <#C07EFN21K|random>. My bad."
166,2017-07-07T00:57:11.082304,Signe,Haha no worries. Im just being silly. Tone is hard on slack :(
166,2017-07-07T00:57:39.086360,Deedee,<@Signe> joking. Have had lots of help from everyone here (especially those from list). Incredibly grateful.
166,2017-07-07T00:57:56.088762,Shelly,<@Alesia> would have anything to add ?
166,2017-07-07T00:58:08.090515,Signe,Its an interesting idea for a slash command for people to annonymously report digression. Maybe add a feature request in <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> for sirbotalot?
166,2017-07-07T00:58:22.092639,Shelly,yup

167,2017-07-07T05:39:45.554172,Mirna,Hi
167,2017-07-07T05:40:56.579679,Mirna,Does anyone have experience in `protobuf`? I want to know how to map a `dictionary` to `protobuf`. I’ve tried this one : `<https://github.com/davyzhang/dict-to-protobuf>`. But it doesn’t work in nested case.
167,2017-07-07T05:42:49.618659,Suellen,"<@Mirna>
found in one of my projects:
`from protobuf_to_dict import protobuf_to_dict, dict_to_protobuf`"
167,2017-07-07T05:43:11.626169,Suellen,The library is called `protobuf3-to-dict`
167,2017-07-07T05:43:22.630293,Suellen,And it handles nested data
167,2017-07-07T05:43:39.636118,Mirna,Ah I see thx <@Suellen>
167,2017-07-07T05:45:47.681004,Carri,There's also <https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/python/google/protobuf/json_format.py#L112> that from the protobuf library
167,2017-07-07T05:50:46.786726,Thomasina,So I ended up trying to use Flask-HTTPAuth as recommended in this thread <https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful/issues/492> however I'm getting `AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'as_view'` even with the most basic demo code. I'm not sure why it wouldn't work...
167,2017-07-07T05:51:34.803829,Mirna,<@Carri> Thx a lot Christ :smile:
167,2017-07-07T05:54:44.872216,Suellen,"Well, functions don't have `as_view`"
167,2017-07-07T05:56:10.902574,Thomasina,"Yes, but I'm not sure why it would be doing that in the first place. I'm just using the standard Flask, Flask-Restful, and Flask-HTTPAuth libraries like in the project, but the `@auth.login_required` decorator throws that error. The project linked in the thread uses it in the same way but apparently doesn't have that problem..."
167,2017-07-07T05:56:17.904961,Thomasina,I have all the requirements installed so... :confused:
167,2017-07-07T05:56:30.909387,Suellen,<https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful/blob/ff64cdbef03aa2ce108a7dc06ca336035ec68b70/flask_restful/__init__.py#L444>
167,2017-07-07T05:56:42.913624,Suellen,Flask-restful registers a view like this
167,2017-07-07T05:56:48.915651,Suellen,and the view is supposed to be a class
167,2017-07-07T05:57:04.921309,Suellen,which have an `as_view` method it seems
167,2017-07-07T05:57:24.928348,Suellen,but `@auth.login_required` returns a function. do you apply this decorator to a class?
167,2017-07-07T05:59:20.968420,Thomasina,Oh shooooooooooot!! Wow! You're right! I had it on a class rather than a function.
167,2017-07-07T05:59:50.978705,Thomasina,Thanks a million!
167,2017-07-07T05:59:59.982172,Suellen,:slightly_smiling_face: you're welcome
167,2017-07-07T06:00:41.999218,Thomasina,"I gotta keep learning, maybe someday I can be as good with Python as you seem to be. :smile:"
168,2017-07-07T14:43:30.476938,Ciera,Is it considered bad practice to append the working dir to the `sys.path` ?
168,2017-07-07T14:45:59.551996,Johana,i think it may be frowned upon. i usually try to avoid it but when i need alembic `env.py` to be aware of my metadata i do this so that i can import it and have it do autogenerated migrations. The benefits i get out of that are huge so i think it’s worth appending to the sys.path.
168,2017-07-07T14:48:31.627559,Beula,"In general cases, yes"
168,2017-07-07T14:48:36.630258,Ciera,ok. It's the only solution I found for <@Alesia> to import plugins without the need to have them installed
168,2017-07-07T14:48:46.635293,Beula,`python -m sirbot` would add the CWD
168,2017-07-07T14:48:52.638209,Beula,if sirbot is an executable module
168,2017-07-07T14:49:09.646800,Ciera,yeah but it's ugly :smile: there is a `sirbot` entry point
168,2017-07-07T14:49:21.653249,Ciera,so it's just `sirbot --config file`
168,2017-07-07T14:49:33.659112,Beula,then make them pip installable!
168,2017-07-07T14:50:47.696354,Ciera,yeah they should be but your custom config is also a plugin
168,2017-07-07T14:51:11.708089,Ciera,so making a `setup.py` and installing that every them you modify isn't very user friendly
168,2017-07-07T14:51:26.715826,Beula,What's the config look like?
168,2017-07-07T14:51:37.721295,Johana,ya pip installable would fix it
168,2017-07-07T14:51:38.721942,Ciera,my solution is to add to the sys path only on `ModuleNotFoundError` so if every thing is installed no problem
168,2017-07-07T14:51:40.722823,Beula,Is it not just a yaml in `~/.sirbotrc`
168,2017-07-07T14:51:58.731683,Beula,"if that works and it makes the user experience better, that's a good solution"
168,2017-07-07T14:51:58.731750,Ciera,yes but you also need to do your business logic
168,2017-07-07T14:52:04.734437,Ciera,what sirbot-pythondev is to us
168,2017-07-07T14:53:26.775808,Ciera,just wanted to know if it was `oh my god never do that` or more `best not to but hey it's python go ahead`
168,2017-07-07T14:56:48.877745,Beula,The latter :slightly_smiling_face:
168,2017-07-07T14:57:04.885742,Beula,Making a better user experience is worth it if only the library has to deal with it!
169,2017-07-07T16:05:37.794704,Beula,"Single, otherwise it includes all that whitespace "
170,2017-07-08T00:59:50.447732,Alba,Hey guys reading some idiomatic Python and saw they had a pattern match on a tuple. Just wondering what `user` would look like here for this to be able to work
170,2017-07-08T01:09:17.483368,Beula,"It's just iterable unpacking, you don't need the parens even for it. The ""user"" here is some sequence type.

You can do that with dicts I think now, but only 3.6+ retain order"
170,2017-07-08T01:11:06.489357,Shelly,"try `(name,age) = chase.values()`, can't confirm the order "
170,2017-07-08T01:48:04.604982,Alba,Thanks guys :)) I see what you mean now <@Beula> and <@Shelly> got it to do what i wanted it to do haha

176,2017-07-09T18:21:39.421841,Meg,or use code formatting

176,2017-07-09T18:22:01.423503,Meg,so the reason why that function is not working is because you're using `and` for everything
176,2017-07-09T18:22:29.425678,Meg,there's no way a variable can be `''` and `' '` at the same time
176,2017-07-09T18:22:54.427550,Meg,"so, for you, the best thing would be to break it out into an if-else conditional test"

176,2017-07-09T18:28:07.452461,Hyacinth,yeah
176,2017-07-09T18:28:22.453645,Meg,"eg `test_items = [['None'], '', ' ', 'item']`?"
176,2017-07-09T18:29:30.458780,Hyacinth,"Right. In fact, it's looks like `list = [ [item,item1,item3], item, [item4,item5], [None] ] `"
176,2017-07-09T18:29:46.460227,Hyacinth,So i need to check when there is no value.
176,2017-07-09T18:30:05.461634,Meg,and definition of no value is an empty string
176,2017-07-09T18:30:12.462264,Meg,or a string with just spaces
176,2017-07-09T18:30:22.463073,Meg,or an item of type `None`
176,2017-07-09T18:30:23.463222,Meg,correct?
176,2017-07-09T18:36:17.490471,Deedee,"`not val` satisfies `None` and `""""`

179,2017-07-10T10:44:08.556739,Aimee,has anyone worked with `gspread` to retrieve and write data to google spreadsheets? getting data from the spreadsheet works totally fine but i am having trouble writing to it. followed the documentation. maybe someone has had similar issues and i am missing something
180,2017-07-10T12:16:43.115913,Myong,Anyone here familiar with SVN?
180,2017-07-10T12:18:29.178200,Gabriele,The version control software?
180,2017-07-10T12:19:36.218014,Myong,Yeah.
180,2017-07-10T12:19:58.230712,Myong,Oh the joys of not being able to use Git
180,2017-07-10T12:20:27.247166,Gabriele,I spent several years with it. What's the problem?
180,2017-07-10T12:22:19.313007,Myong,Got a huge code base of multiple versions of a project and I needed to basically just get the newest versions. It seems that something happened to my local directory so it may or not be updating and checking out everything from the server
180,2017-07-10T12:22:48.330786,Myong,But it seems like a common issue is a `forcibly closed connection` also `truncated http response` and `hash mismatch`
180,2017-07-10T12:23:35.357903,Gabriele,ugh... sounds weird. Are you pulling from an HTTP repository then?
180,2017-07-10T12:23:37.359148,Myong,The hash mismatch problem seems fixed by going to the local directory where the issue occurred and running `svn update --set-depth empty` then `svn update --set-depth infinity`
180,2017-07-10T12:24:50.402623,Myong,<@Gabriele> yes
180,2017-07-10T12:25:04.410670,Myong,It's a outside hosted server
180,2017-07-10T12:25:10.413692,Myong,outside of our network that is
180,2017-07-10T12:25:48.436327,Myong,Also occasionally run into hanging on update. I use the CLI cause the GUI is just way too slow having to cleanup due to locked repo.
180,2017-07-10T12:26:02.445113,Myong,Where in the console it will just sit for a while
180,2017-07-10T12:26:20.455921,Myong,and eventually I have to `ctrl-c` and then `svn cleanup` and `svn update`
180,2017-07-10T12:26:46.471426,Myong,"It probably wouldn't be such a huge PITA, but it's a massive repo"
180,2017-07-10T12:29:03.552053,Gabriele,"yeah... sorry that I probably can't help, because I've never had that sort of problem with it"
180,2017-07-10T12:30:24.600016,Myong,"No problem, thanks anyways"

182,2017-07-10T16:07:09.865299,Beula,"Looks like you are trying to access the MySQL server through the socket, I think you need to set it to use the port and the hostname `my-db` (or whatever `link` arg you name)"

something like this?"
182,2017-07-10T16:12:07.021123,Beula,"No, it's what you link it as, so the `docker run --name=test-app -p 8000:8000 -it -v $PWD:/app --link my-db --env-file=.env myapp:dev` The `--link my-db` would name the link `my-db`"
182,2017-07-10T16:12:39.037444,Beula,"So I think you need to change your mysql connection string to be looking at the port, not a local socket"

182,2017-07-10T16:14:57.109369,Beula,"that looks invalid, `--link` requires an argument"
182,2017-07-10T16:15:21.122177,Beula,"I am saying, just use what you originally posted, but in your app code where you connect to the database, use the hostname `my-db`"
182,2017-07-10T16:17:50.201199,Beula,What lib are you using to talk to your DB?
182,2017-07-10T16:19:51.263498,Bella,mysql-python

182,2017-07-10T16:21:25.313133,Beula,"So presuming you are using `--link my-db`, you should be able to change `localhost` to `my-db` for the host"

184,2017-07-10T18:32:32.771155,Staci,haha I'm just wondering how they managed to access them back in 1600 with no computers
184,2017-07-10T18:33:02.780569,Patty,That’s Windows for ya
184,2017-07-10T18:33:06.782121,Patty,"(well, Active Directory)"
184,2017-07-10T18:33:07.782319,Carrol,I wonder if it has anything to do with noatime family of mount flags. they are often used with ssds
184,2017-07-10T18:34:01.799888,Patty,"with AD, times are represented as tickts from midnight, Jan 1 1600 in active directory, powershell cant handle it"
184,2017-07-10T18:34:05.801161,Patty,it means it wasnt accessed
184,2017-07-10T18:34:28.808514,Staci,Well I just opened the file
184,2017-07-10T18:34:33.810038,Patty,Powershell and AD have different epochs as well
184,2017-07-10T18:34:42.812755,Patty,0001 vs 1600
184,2017-07-10T18:35:08.821188,Staci,I think the network shared drive is doing something weird with the last accessed date
184,2017-07-10T18:35:36.829870,Carrol,I bet it doesn't update it to save drive's lifespan
184,2017-07-10T18:35:38.830296,Patty,yeah since it’s probably managed through AD
184,2017-07-10T18:36:52.852584,Patty,"basically, it’s a combination of python, Windows, PowerShell, and Active Directory in a storm of a mess"

184,2017-07-10T18:38:25.880714,Patty,AD permissions may also be preventing you (or the script) from seeing the last modified time
184,2017-07-10T18:40:58.927108,Staci,That last accessed date was going to come in handy
184,2017-07-10T18:41:08.929919,Staci,But it's all fucked

184,2017-07-10T18:45:09.003157,Patty,its a bit that gets marked when the file is archived - which has some weird definitions

This is probably a silly question, but do you by chance know if this was enabled if it would retro date everything accessed previously? This is probably a pipe dream, but maybe the data is stored locally on everyone's own PCs?"
184,2017-07-10T19:22:35.646462,Patty,<@Staci> if auditing is the issue and it wasn’t on then you probably wont. Unless someone replaced a file with their local version then maybe
184,2017-07-10T19:28:19.737266,Patty,Have you tried `os.path.getmtime(path)`?
184,2017-07-10T19:33:15.816095,Staci,I haven't. I'll test it

How would I get the index of a namedtuple field through code without looking at the definition? This is so I can write a code that will use this named tuple by field name rather than index so if the indexes change later down the line with code changes it won't break, and for easier reading?

```

186,2017-07-10T23:20:46.592963,Meghan,"Yeah, it would. I shouldn't program at night. :slightly_smiling_face:"
186,2017-07-10T23:21:11.597003,Meghan,"Though, in yours the else isn't necessary."
186,2017-07-10T23:23:22.617615,Deedee,"technically, this could all be brought down to:
```

right?"
186,2017-07-10T23:23:52.622278,Meghan,"No. Include is a whitelist, if include is empty it should give all entries not in exclude."
186,2017-07-10T23:23:58.623288,Deedee,because in both of the first 2 if's you are demanding that `entry` not be an element of exclude

186,2017-07-10T23:24:49.631251,Deedee,this is yoru orginal code
186,2017-07-10T23:25:36.638704,Deedee,"so if `include is None`, it goes to the `else` and checks that `entry` be an element of `exclude`"
186,2017-07-10T23:25:41.639434,Deedee,right?
186,2017-07-10T23:26:01.642691,Deedee,sorry... NOT an element of `exclude`
186,2017-07-10T23:26:05.643413,Meghan,Right.
186,2017-07-10T23:26:41.649382,Deedee,"but if include NOT None, you are checking that `entry` not an element of `exclude`"

I could remove the if include and include it in the next if"
186,2017-07-10T23:27:41.659421,Deedee,I'm just saying that `if include:` doesn't seem to have any bearing on what the condition does.
186,2017-07-10T23:27:58.661874,Deedee,because entry still has to NOT be an element in `exclude`
186,2017-07-10T23:29:40.678535,Deedee,"so essentially this function returns False when entry is in exclude, regardless of anything else that happens."
186,2017-07-10T23:30:21.686079,Meghan,If include isn't an empty list then the entry is included if not in exclude. If include has entries and the entry matches one of the items in include then the entry is included if not in exclude.
186,2017-07-10T23:32:23.706777,Meghan,"So, if whitelist then only include entry if it is in whilelist (and also not in blacklist).

If only blacklist include everything not in blacklist."
186,2017-07-10T23:32:29.707812,Deedee,brb
186,2017-07-10T23:33:31.718196,Meghan,"The first if is necessary as well, because without it the code would see if entry is in an empty list, which it never will be and the lack of whitelist means nothing gets through."
186,2017-07-10T23:36:40.749052,Meghan,It might be better if I changed those variables names to whiltelist and blacklist.

186,2017-07-11T00:09:58.075628,Meghan,Full code to the above: <https://github.com/TomFaulkner/pypihole>
186,2017-07-11T00:32:03.287987,Signe,<@Meghan> the easy answer is that you should never change the indexes/order on a named tuple
186,2017-07-11T00:32:50.295851,Signe,"Thats a breaking change. If your concerned about that, you should probably use a class or dictionary and not let people use indexes"
186,2017-07-11T00:34:04.308359,Meghan,"Yeah, I think I probably have to agree there. As nice as namedtuples are, that does make it easy to break things should the data being analyzed changed."
186,2017-07-11T00:37:07.337114,Kiersten,"<@Meghan> Are you trying to get the index of the property, when you first defined it?

186,2017-07-11T00:40:45.371478,Meghan,"Actually, in the case of a namedtuple, it might make sense to do the underscore to avoid someone naming one of their fields 'fields' and breaking things."
186,2017-07-11T00:42:47.390382,Deedee,"I know we already went over this but I really think that:
```

            return True

        if entry not in exclude:

190,2017-07-11T08:08:35.229443,Carri,you could set a timer for example to refresh your API keys
190,2017-07-11T08:09:31.249459,Patty,You’re better off using `crontab` over keeping script running. Better chances of it running successfully because a long-running process can die for a lot of reasons

190,2017-07-11T08:11:40.294252,Carri,and have your signal handle in your python app to refresh API keys on receiving a HUP

190,2017-07-11T08:19:49.468415,Ruben,How does the API provider know when you start your script? Does the script ask for keys when it starts for the first time?
190,2017-07-11T08:21:19.501216,Tristan,"Yes, script do first get request and then give some code which I use in params when doing new request to API. After 2 hours this code expires and my export of data stop."
190,2017-07-11T08:25:43.600091,Patty,are you continually hitting an API and just need the re-register of the API key to run every 2 hours?
190,2017-07-11T08:32:01.745084,Tristan,"Yes, but I have while loop forever !"
190,2017-07-11T10:04:44.624343,Patty,"<@Tristan> but between getting the new API keys you are running other requests, correct? Also, what site is this? There may be a way to get longer API keys"
190,2017-07-11T10:07:41.734959,Tristan,"Joe, I get this code from api and then I request one api every 15 seconds in ```while True: ``` loop  and parsing response. After 2 hours code expires and my loop don’t have response. This is proxmox KVM virtualization."
190,2017-07-11T10:09:28.801213,Patty,"ah okay, yeah then the previous mentions of daemonizing the process is probably your best bet"
191,2017-07-11T07:52:35.904111,Meg,crontab?
192,2017-07-11T10:44:42.173773,Tami,"Hey, versioning and giving my commits build numbers is something I've neglected for a while. How should I go about it? I'm using Mercurial + Kiln currently, and I know there is a tag system which can help out with that but I'm just not sure where to begin. Isn't the best practice to have something like `&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;hotfix&gt;.&lt;build&gt;`? Also, is there a way to make this automatically generated?"
192,2017-07-11T10:47:00.263918,Gabriele,"I prefer to make my versioning explicit... at least the major/minor/hotfix slots. It's not usually practical for an automated system to know whether a given change is API-breaking or not, after all"
192,2017-07-11T10:52:31.484783,Beula,"It really depends on what you're making. If it's a web app or API, then build numbers should be fine. However for a library you do want explicit versioning. Some ci solutions allow you to have a manual intervention point"
192,2017-07-11T11:16:31.459538,Tami,"<@Gabriele> <@Beula> Thanks, I'll think about what exactly it is I'm doing. I think manual versioning is the way to go for now, and ignore tagging commits."
192,2017-07-11T11:17:48.509968,Gabriele,"I do tag commits... it's just a manual process for me, or facilitated with git-flow or whatever"
192,2017-07-11T12:06:04.437572,Beula,"General question, that came up in the TestPodcast slack group: what preferred docstring format do people use? reStructuredText, Google, etc?"
192,2017-07-11T12:21:59.017692,Gabriele,Shouldn't the math.pow arguments be the other way around?
193,2017-07-11T11:11:28.262003,Margy,"Hey guys, I'm trying to run Docker (with a Debian image) on a Mac. My Python installation on Mac has case-sensitive imports but not in Docker, and this is breaking the `queue` module which has both `queue` and `Queue`. I'm guessing the Python build on Mac deals with Mac having case-insensitive file system but in Docker it's a Debian build so it doesn't, but because Docker is using case-insensitive file system, it causes issue. Is there any way around this?"
193,2017-07-11T11:13:11.328113,Meghan,"<@Kiersten> <@Beula> The issue is that I want to pass the field name to a generic function so it can be used to filter on any field name. <https://github.com/TomFaulkner/pypihole/blob/master/pypihole/pypihole.py> See the counts_client and _counts_generic functions. (line 62 and 69-70 in particular)

I do access the namedtuple with the entry.client and such wherever possible, of course. But, I don't think that is possible here."
194,2017-07-11T12:06:29.453610,Johana,reStructeredText here but i have used google and numpy before
194,2017-07-11T12:06:59.473440,Johana,numpy is really nice to use when having to make ML researchers document their code.

194,2017-07-11T12:08:36.533898,Beula,interesting
194,2017-07-11T12:08:50.542055,Beula,I do the default pycharm (reStructuredText) too
194,2017-07-11T12:22:03.020447,Gabriele,Also: <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/backoff/1.4.0>
194,2017-07-11T12:22:35.039412,Beula,That packaged didn't work for me because I am yielding a generator and need the state vs just re-calling the function
194,2017-07-11T12:22:46.045755,Gabriele,aha
194,2017-07-11T12:23:28.070805,Beula,"the short is I am hitting a few APIs with `requests` that do pagination, and sometimes they give random 502s because their SLA isn't great"
194,2017-07-11T12:23:41.078974,Vita,for a second i thought that was a joke class telling people to leave you alone when you were coding
194,2017-07-11T12:24:21.102703,Beula,I think the `pow` is right <@Gabriele> - the retry count^backoff-factor
194,2017-07-11T12:24:27.106567,Beula,is that not the normal way to do it?
194,2017-07-11T12:25:03.128328,Beula,"for my case, it goes from 10s, 21s, 33s"
194,2017-07-11T12:26:14.170845,Gabriele,"hmm, I guess"
194,2017-07-11T12:27:26.214854,Beula,"Nah, I think you are right. 1.1^1, 1.1^2, etc makes sense"

194,2017-07-11T14:09:33.825952,Junita,"ooh, that’s neat"
194,2017-07-11T14:11:07.880712,Beula,"Thanks <@Suellen> - I'll take a gander. Looks pretty neat, and likely that I could just define a nested function to make sure the state is kept correctly across paged requests"
194,2017-07-11T14:13:49.973763,Beula,"Oh man, that lib showed me `pook`, which looks pretty awesome for testing"
194,2017-07-11T14:19:39.179392,Margy,"<@Junita> I did more research on my problem. It seems on Mac/Windows, Python enforces case-sensitivity with import at compilation. Because I run Debian in Docker on Mac, Python does not enforce case-sensitivity (it's Debian) but the filesystem is not case sensitive, so import does not distinguish cases. One of my dependencies uses `queue`, which internally imports `Queue`. Without case-sensitivity, it causes circular import, where `queue` imports itself. There are others reporting this type of issue: <https://forums.docker.com/t/python-import-source-files-from-docker-volumns-can-not-distinct-upper-lower-cases-in-lib-name/20527> . I worked around this with a very ugly hack, by appending the path of `Queue` at the front of `sys.path` right before a call that results in `queue` getting imported, and then I delete the path from `sys.path` after. I only need this for development so it seems to be OK."
194,2017-07-11T14:22:25.275450,Junita,"I’d be shocked if there’s a case mistake in the python standard library.  It was Queue in Python 2, and is queue in Python 3 - are you sure perhaps it’s not an issue of the python version?"
194,2017-07-11T14:27:43.460713,Gabriele,"Looks like there is some platform-specific case-handling behavior (PEP 235) and it predates things like Docker, so maybe it's not surprising it gets confused"
194,2017-07-11T14:28:46.498175,Junita,Right but the general issue for people using Docker on Mac is that it’s “Linux” so the file system isn’t case-sensitive.  This isn’t so much a Docker issue as an issue of people being exposed to a case-sensitive file-system
194,2017-07-11T14:29:02.507508,Margy,I think the `queue` is for backwards compatibility for 3 to 2
194,2017-07-11T14:29:12.513449,Margy,"```
from __future__ import absolute_import
import sys
__future_module__ = True

if sys.version_info[0] &lt; 3:
    from Queue import *
else:
    raise ImportError('This package should not be accessible on Python 3. '
                      'Either you are trying to run from the python-future src folder '
                      'or your installation of python-future is corrupted.')
```"
194,2017-07-11T14:29:54.538694,Margy,The import on line 6 is circular without case-sensitivity
194,2017-07-11T14:30:51.572752,Junita,"Well there is a class Queue in the Queue module, maybe that’s messing it up?   What happens if you do `from Queue import Queue`?"
194,2017-07-11T14:33:17.659090,Margy,"The issue was, that small piece of code tries to import `Queue`, while it itself is `queue`, which effectively allows code to import python2 `Queue` even though they refer to python3 `queue`"
194,2017-07-11T14:33:37.670689,Margy,But it broke without case-sensitivity
194,2017-07-11T14:33:50.678523,Margy,The actualy implementation of `Queue` is perfectly fine
194,2017-07-11T14:36:25.768785,Junita,oh - is your python file itself named queue.py?
194,2017-07-11T14:41:32.943991,Margy,"There is a queue module (basically the code I pasted), I think it's a dependency from another package"
194,2017-07-11T14:42:02.960924,Margy,Probably just to bridge python 3 and 2
195,2017-07-11T13:18:04.002368,Signe,<@Shelly> :taco:
196,2017-07-11T13:36:32.643971,Junita,<@Margy> did you get your problem figured out?  could you share how you tried to import things?  This shouldn’t be a problem

199,2017-07-11T18:51:50.165591,Mariano,yeah. I'm restarting the IDE
199,2017-07-11T18:52:39.180422,Mariano,too good for it.

201,2017-07-12T04:45:26.170823,Zackary,Hi guys! Anyone who knows how to set up queued or delayed mails in django? Kind of like how you do in Laravel
201,2017-07-12T05:20:36.003325,Junita,<@Zackary> have you looked at something like django-celery?
201,2017-07-12T07:10:39.303435,Zackary,<@Junita> No - I will have a look at it. Thanks!
201,2017-07-12T07:11:43.323504,Zackary,"<@Junita> btw, do you know anything about best practice for using environment vars in Django? It’s very easy with Laravel, pulling the env vars from a .env file… But django doenst seem to do it that way.

So far, I have just placed an env.py file in the root of the project, and imported it into my settings.py."
201,2017-07-12T07:12:55.345178,Junita,yeah I actually wrote a little tool to simplify doing that in my python projects: <https://github.com/jimjkelly/yaep>
201,2017-07-12T07:13:59.364285,Junita,"but the basics if you don’t want anything fancy is just `os.getenv(KEY, default)`"
201,2017-07-12T07:14:15.369222,Junita,"oh, and loading the `.env` file I suppose"
201,2017-07-12T07:56:11.150223,Zackary,"Okay, thanks <@Junita>"
201,2017-07-12T08:56:28.567600,Noemi,"Yeah, pip was happy, confirmed that all of my dependencies are there too. I am puzzled"
202,2017-07-12T09:19:52.273496,Thomasina,I'm using Flask and have fallen victim to the surprisingly common circular dependency issue. Do I pretty much have to use an app factory pattern to get around this?
202,2017-07-12T09:22:30.356682,Beula,"<@Thomasina> pretty much, if you have source to look at we may be able to suggest something else, but my guess is the factory is the simplest way"
202,2017-07-12T09:26:16.477415,Gabriele,"I also found that it helped to avoid various flask extensions, because they would usually mean dragging in a further dependency on the `app` object to implement whatever behavior the extension added"
202,2017-07-12T09:31:42.657953,Beula,<@Thomasina> Here is a sample app we deprecated from <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> - <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old>
202,2017-07-12T09:34:25.750136,Thomasina,"<@Beula> Well, my current code works, _but_ I'm making use of `from models import *` and using any other method of import fails. I heard that importing like that should generally always be avoided though. I'm not entirely sure why that is (yet) so I'm not sure if it's worth fussing over or if I might as well continue with it as is."
202,2017-07-12T09:36:36.825383,Thomasina,"<@Gabriele> I'm using several Flask extensions, but I suppose the issue in this case comes from Flask-SQLAlchemy specifically. I'm wondering why the extensions exist if they're so prone to these problems though? Is the user just expected to use an app factory pattern? I'm surprised that even the most basic Flask tutorials seem to have this issue. The first tutorial I ever did wouldn't run due to a circular import error, even though the tutorial didn't mention any error and seemed to produce the correct results of the app running as if there was no error."
202,2017-07-12T09:37:02.840233,Beula,It's discouraged because it pollutes the namespace with everything from `models`
202,2017-07-12T09:37:08.843230,Beula,Including its imports
202,2017-07-12T09:37:08.843600,Gabriele,All I can say is that I stripped Flask-SQLAlchemy out for exactly this reason. Other people managed to coerce it into working. :slightly_smiling_face:
202,2017-07-12T09:38:37.894236,Beula,"for example:

```
# module a.py
import secrets

def do_thing():
    pass

# module b.py
from a import *
locals()   # will have do_thing and secrets available...!
```"
202,2017-07-12T09:38:57.905445,Thomasina,<@Gabriele> To be frank the reason I'm using the extension is because it seemed a lot more straightforward to use than SQLAlchemy by itself. Guess I'll have to choose between app factory and that.
202,2017-07-12T09:39:25.921315,Beula,Any reason you dislike the app factory? I'd say the extension is worth it IMO
202,2017-07-12T09:39:30.924040,Gabriele,"I have an app factory, and even that didn't solve all my problems, because various functionality likes to have the app at module-level for decorators, etc"
202,2017-07-12T09:40:38.963691,Thomasina,"<@Beula> Despite being a coder for longer than I'd like to specify, I've never had to implement an app factory pattern, and I'm wondering how much learning there would be. I generally learn pretty quickly but I am on a fairly tight schedule."
202,2017-07-12T09:41:06.980182,Beula,"It depends on if you need to import the app elsewhere to work with it, I usually avoid that (but sometimes you cant)"
202,2017-07-12T09:41:36.997665,Thomasina,Also wondering if that is in fact the best move considering what Kylotan said. If implementing the pattern would still leave me with import issues later on...well...it sounds like it could be more efficient to just ditch problematic extensions
202,2017-07-12T09:41:36.997872,Beula,"In those cases, I use an `init_app` in a module that initializes the top level things that need to be decorated by `@app`"
202,2017-07-12T09:41:57.009708,Beula,I can't say I have had those issues
202,2017-07-12T09:42:09.016685,Beula,You just need to pass the app around sometimes during the startup/bootstrap phase
202,2017-07-12T09:42:53.041819,Gabriele,The app factory is really simple. Giving it the name 'factory' makes it sound like some sort of complex pattern but really it's just a function that returns a thing.
202,2017-07-12T09:43:44.071767,Beula,"Yeah, I added a link to a thread above <@Thomasina> for reference"
202,2017-07-12T09:44:59.116874,Thomasina,"<@Beula> so to be clear, `init_app` is a method of a module separate from the main module that runs the init code that I'd usually have in my main module, or...?"
202,2017-07-12T09:45:44.143323,Beula,"Yeah, it's simply a way to lazily initialize other things that depend on the app object"
202,2017-07-12T09:46:13.160044,Beula,"for example, how I do blueprints: <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/blueprints/__init__.py#L7>"
202,2017-07-12T09:46:39.175556,Beula,And how I do the external dependencies (extensions): <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/external.py#L28>
202,2017-07-12T09:46:49.181537,Thomasina,"Yes, blueprints. I see most Flask-based projects on GitHub use these but I'm not using them _at all_. I think I'm probably missing something here."
202,2017-07-12T09:47:21.200566,Gabriele,blueprints help you keep the `app` out of most of your files
202,2017-07-12T09:47:32.207025,Beula,"yeah, that will cause you issues. But you can do an `init_app` style like this, rather than importing the app directly (which is probably why you have the issue)"
202,2017-07-12T09:47:39.211166,Beula,to get around it temporarily
202,2017-07-12T09:47:48.216537,Beula,but blueprints == important
202,2017-07-12T09:48:19.235129,Thomasina,"Ya, even though I don't completely understand it, I feel that I should be implementing blue prints and an app factory pattern asap to avoid even more headaches later on..."
202,2017-07-12T09:48:55.256714,Beula,"Yeah, they are really helpful"
202,2017-07-12T09:49:33.279306,Gabriele,It's annoying that this stuff is buried towards the back of the Flask docs (if I remember correctly) because I'd contend it's almost impossible to build a non-trivial Flask app without it
202,2017-07-12T09:49:53.291508,Beula,They want people to get the initial wins to like it
202,2017-07-12T09:52:16.377811,Beula,Part of why I am not using flask as much is that it encourages crap like this: <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/external.py#L39>
202,2017-07-12T09:52:21.381037,Thomasina,"<@Gabriele> Ya, it boggles my mind how non-obvious these things are to new users of Flask such as myself. I wasn't even aware these things existed for awhile, never mind that they were at all important."
202,2017-07-12T09:53:01.404822,Beula,"Unfortunately most blogs and stuff only show happy path projects, few people educate on good patterns"
202,2017-07-12T09:53:14.412263,Thomasina,"`from .models`
How does that work? O_o"
202,2017-07-12T09:53:23.417619,Beula,relative import
202,2017-07-12T09:53:46.431591,Beula,<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#intra-package-references>
202,2017-07-12T09:54:39.464137,Thomasina,"Ohhh, I see. Being rather new to Python I hadn't seen that before. Didn't exist in any other language I'd been coding in either. I take it that's something to avoid as well? I think I fell victim to at least a few of those tutorials that have some not-so-good practices mixed in with them"
202,2017-07-12T09:55:09.482574,Beula,"relative imports are okay, but yeah - generally importing in a function/class/method is discouraged"
202,2017-07-12T09:55:24.491999,Junita,"yeah, relative imports themselves are actually quite good"
202,2017-07-12T09:55:37.499958,Thomasina,Do imports by themselves generally have a lot of overhead?
202,2017-07-12T09:55:48.506945,Beula,relative imports lets you avoid refactor annoyances with renaming packages and such
202,2017-07-12T09:55:59.513744,Junita,you get to be quite explicit about where you are getting stuff from
202,2017-07-12T09:56:32.533955,Junita,in the general case I wouldn’t worry about import overhead
202,2017-07-12T09:56:44.541908,Beula,<https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSpeed/PerformanceTips#Import_Statement_Overhead>
202,2017-07-12T09:56:59.550891,Beula,"&gt; import statements can be executed just about anywhere. It's often useful to place them inside functions to restrict their visibility and/or reduce initial startup time. Although Python's interpreter is optimized to not import the same module multiple times, repeatedly executing an import statement can seriously affect performance in some circumstances."
202,2017-07-12T09:56:59.550901,Thomasina,"I imported some APIs within functions because I thought it was kind of wasteful to import - for example - a Yelp, FourSquare, and EventBrite library when only the TicketMaster library would be needed for a certain call to my API, and after learning you can import in functions in Python."
202,2017-07-12T09:57:29.570000,Beula,It actually does have impact that matters
202,2017-07-12T09:57:51.583855,Beula,"Ideally you'd only do that at app-startup, not each call (e.g. don't import into an http endpoint handler)"
202,2017-07-12T09:58:25.605045,Gabriele,"...yeah, I was about to say that. You usually want this sort of thing out of the way at startup time"
202,2017-07-12T10:00:49.698858,Thomasina,"Wouldn't the result be the same? I mean, at the risk of sounding like an idiot (this is my first PaaS project), every time someone calls my API doesn't `app.py` - in my Procfile: `web: python app.py` - run again and the whole process starts over?"
202,2017-07-12T10:01:01.707001,Gabriele,no
202,2017-07-12T10:01:49.737510,Gabriele,"At least not usually. Python servers, including Flask, are typically long-running processes. They sit waiting for requests, and when they've finished with one, they wait for the next"
202,2017-07-12T10:01:55.741269,Beula,you also want to use gunicorn (or a different interface server)
202,2017-07-12T10:01:58.743033,Beula,don't use the flask devserver for prod
202,2017-07-12T10:02:46.774204,Beula,"but the way some of those work is as <@Gabriele> said. Some will restart a subprocess after it's handled some number of requests to limit memory growth, or something similar"
202,2017-07-12T10:03:51.815478,Thomasina,"Oh no, how do I know if I'm using the devserver on Heroku? It completely slipped my mind and I didn't use gunicorn...so I guess I am? :dizzy_face:"
202,2017-07-12T10:04:03.823513,Beula,`python app.py` suggests you are
202,2017-07-12T10:05:05.862900,Thomasina,Well...yes...I think I am. I guess when I was brand new and just starting the project I somehow thought that Heroku would take of the server stuff...guess that doesn't make much sense.. whoops
202,2017-07-12T10:05:17.871027,Gabriele,"It's fine in the short term if you're still developing or have a tiny number of users, but you'll probably want to test in a 'proper' config sooner rather than later to verify that everything still works"
202,2017-07-12T10:06:31.916937,Gabriele,"For example, we had big problems when we moved our Flask app to Elastic Beanstalk because it has its own particular way that it expects Flask apps to be structured, which didn't match our existing setup"
202,2017-07-12T10:07:14.943673,Thomasina,"So - and I still can't believe I didn't already realize this - Heroku runs my project on a server but it's truly a bare server without any HTTP functionality for example, which is why something like gunicorn is needed, right?"
202,2017-07-12T10:07:49.965970,Beula,they have a load balancer in front
202,2017-07-12T10:07:56.970168,Gabriele,"No, it's more that Flask has its own built-in HTTP server that is not designed to run at scale, just to service your local developer requests and that's about it"
202,2017-07-12T10:08:30.991896,Thomasina,"So, without the Flask server running, Heroku would take care of that part? :upside_down_face:"
202,2017-07-12T10:09:08.015292,Beula,no
202,2017-07-12T10:09:30.028876,Beula,"Without the flask server or gunicorn running, heroku would show an error page"
202,2017-07-12T10:10:12.055258,Gabriele,"Go here, scroll down to ""The Web Server"": <https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xviii-deployment-on-the-heroku-cloud>"
202,2017-07-12T10:10:20.060310,Meg,"so the flow is something liek this

request -&gt; Heroku LB -&gt; Heroku Instance -&gt; Guincorn/wsgi -&gt; Flask/Django"
202,2017-07-12T10:11:46.113852,Meg,the internal flask http server is not meant for production
202,2017-07-12T10:12:05.125916,Meg,"its slow, can't scale at all"
202,2017-07-12T10:12:24.137968,Thomasina,"<@Gabriele> Haha, I had learned a lot of what I know from that tutorial but hadn't gone through the whole thing. Guess I should've taken time to do the _whole_ thing."
202,2017-07-12T10:12:28.140357,Meg,thats why you need to have somethign up front to separate into processes and handle concurrent requests
202,2017-07-12T10:32:04.902293,Thomasina,<@Meg> Wow. That's a super clear explainer! Thanks!
202,2017-07-12T10:32:49.933105,Thomasina,<@Meg> So gunicorn takes care of this process splitting and such?
203,2017-07-12T10:08:54.006598,Meg,thats what you need gunicorn for
203,2017-07-12T10:24:50.612825,Johana,i’ve used the factory pattern and blueprints since the beginning with many extensions and never had any issues.
203,2017-07-12T10:25:49.651388,Zackary,Any preferred web hotels to use for hosting django?
203,2017-07-12T10:28:51.771928,Beula,"Depends on what you want, there is <http://pythonanywhere.com|pythonanywhere.com>, <http://heroku.com|heroku.com> as two _easy_ solutions (infrastructure as a service)"
203,2017-07-12T10:29:12.785455,Beula,I just use Digital Ocean or AWS (usually the former)
203,2017-07-12T10:31:59.898411,Meg,DO for personal
203,2017-07-12T10:32:01.900025,Meg,AWS for work
203,2017-07-12T10:33:04.943576,Meg,correct
203,2017-07-12T10:35:48.051610,Johana,DO for personal but if you are new to AWS you can get a year free of their micro-instances which is really nice.
203,2017-07-12T10:36:41.087147,Johana,<https://aws.amazon.com/free/>
203,2017-07-12T10:37:04.101731,Johana,"&gt; These free tier offers are only available to new AWS customers, and are available for 12 months following your AWS sign-up date. When your 12 month free usage term expires or if your application use exceeds the tiers, you simply pay standard, pay-as-you-go service rates (see each service page for full pricing details). Restrictions apply; see offer terms for more details."
203,2017-07-12T10:38:45.167522,Thomasina,And is the benefit of using blueprints solely to help with avoiding circular import issues?
203,2017-07-12T10:38:58.175939,Junita,if you don’t have a lot of experience with all that stuff I’d say Heroku can be a good first step
203,2017-07-12T10:39:19.189905,Junita,"as matt said, infrastructure as a service makes things nice and easy"
203,2017-07-12T10:39:32.198198,Beula,"<@Thomasina> - no, blueprints are just a good way to break up your app into components and separate concerns."
203,2017-07-12T10:40:07.220770,Beula,They can help with the import issue since you decorate the route with `@bp.route` instead of `@app.route` though
203,2017-07-12T10:41:53.291661,Thomasina,<@Beula> the breaking up an app into components thing sounds like good OOP really. So blueprints somehow extend this concept?
203,2017-07-12T10:42:09.302115,Gabriele,I'd say it's more about general modularity than OOP
203,2017-07-12T10:43:08.340354,Thomasina,"Ah, ok"
203,2017-07-12T10:43:16.345608,Thomasina,"Also, I'm using Flask-restful so I don't have any route decorators, instead `api.add_resource(API_Users, '/users/')` :speak_no_evil: Not sure if that makes a difference in your example, <@Beula>"
203,2017-07-12T10:44:20.388905,Beula,"I am not familiar with that one, but it looks like they probably build on top of blueprints and you have to register the `api` with your app"
203,2017-07-12T10:46:27.475251,Thomasina,"Register the api? Sorry... I'm not sure if I understand. :disappointed: ""Register""? Which `api` might that be?"
203,2017-07-12T10:47:06.501700,Beula,"Ah, no you use `Api(app)` or `api = Api(); api.init_app(app)`"
203,2017-07-12T10:47:12.505743,Beula,That is what I was looking for
203,2017-07-12T10:47:49.531345,Johana,"```
api = Api(app)

class HelloWorld(Resource):
    def get(self):
        return {'hello': 'world'}

api.add_resource(HelloWorld, '/')
```"
203,2017-07-12T10:48:37.563178,Johana,"api = Api(app) is registering api with app, no?"
203,2017-07-12T10:50:23.633909,Thomasina,"Ah, yes, that's right. I guess it's the ""you have to register the `api` with your app""...this is what I'm already doing, right? I'm not sure if it was meant that I need to do this (e.g. I haven't done it) or if it's just being stated that I was required to do this..."
203,2017-07-12T10:53:33.762705,Johana,"to do this with a blueprint you can do:
```
#extensions.py
api = Api()
```


```
from extensions import api
bp = Blueprint('api', __name__, url_prefix='/api/v1')

api.init_app(bp)

class HelloWorld(Resource):
    def get(self):
        return {'hello': 'world'}

api.add_resource(HelloWorld, '/')
```"
203,2017-07-12T11:00:38.061646,Thomasina,<@Johana> Oh nice! Thanks for the example! Makes a lot more sense to me now.
203,2017-07-12T11:01:10.084009,Thomasina,"So I guess I should dive into learning to implement gunicorn, blueprints, and app factory patterns now. Thanks for the help guys! I can't tell you how much I appreciate it."
203,2017-07-12T11:01:24.093910,Johana,i haven’t updated this in a while but it’s a good approach to using blueprints and app factory pattern. <https://github.com/mikefromit/real_world_flask>
203,2017-07-12T11:02:37.145866,Beula,"Here is another take, but it's a cookiecutter so slightly less obvious to read: <https://github.com/mrasband/cookiecutter-flask>"
203,2017-07-12T11:03:25.178566,Johana,mine is slightly based off mattupstates blog article <http://mattupstate.com/blog/how-i-structure-my-flask-applications/>
203,2017-07-12T11:03:51.196113,Johana,i asked him tons of questions about his structure in the #pocoo channel on irc.
203,2017-07-12T11:04:20.215708,Johana,this was when i was learning flask. i don’t use everything he does.
203,2017-07-12T11:04:49.235368,Beula,"I guess adding a procfile to either/both would help newbies that use heroku, even if they don't use heroku it at least shows the ""prod command"""
203,2017-07-12T11:07:23.339644,Johana,flask project structure is interesting and i have found that even my own has evolved over time as i pick up new conventions. i do run several flask apps in production for my organization. one of them runs our biglearn platform and is very similar to the link i posted.
203,2017-07-12T11:08:44.393353,Johana,it powers this guy: <https://openstax.org/openstax-tutor>
203,2017-07-12T11:10:13.453210,Johana,i don’t mention that to toot my own horn. i just happen to love flask and i want to assure everyone that it can run enterprise level stuff.
203,2017-07-12T11:18:48.799903,Ciera,Yeah it's not possible
203,2017-07-12T11:24:16.020575,Junita,<@Noemi> are you running the tests in both instances from the root of the api_tests folder?
203,2017-07-12T11:27:35.155168,Noemi,"I have a set of UI tests structured the same way using pytest and selenium, I don't have this issue with those"
204,2017-07-12T11:00:36.059737,Danille,"Guys, hi
I have searched for it a little bit, but still dont find information

When I write a custom path in django logging settings like ‘filename’: ‘logs/main.log’ a error occur saying that there is no such file

Am I really should create it manually? Or there is a way it can be done automatically, if no such file exist?"
204,2017-07-12T11:01:54.115493,Johana,i had many ideas for it initially but it was pushed up mainly to help someone who had a project structure question.
204,2017-07-12T11:18:01.767779,Alba,"<@Ciera> re: github api 

did you find out if you can invite a user to a team if they haven't joined the organization yet?"
204,2017-07-12T11:21:34.911727,Meg,<@Noemi> no clue. but I would suggest you have your dev and deployment environments on the same OS
204,2017-07-12T11:21:44.918368,Meg,"and if you can't, use docker or vagrant to do so"
204,2017-07-12T11:21:58.928493,Meg,then you would avoid OS-distinct issues like this
204,2017-07-12T11:24:18.021993,Meg,A possible exception would be Java webapps where you're using Tomcat/Jetty/some other container
204,2017-07-12T11:25:27.068517,Noemi,"<@Junita> yes, root of the directory"
204,2017-07-12T11:26:55.127901,Noemi,Just noticed a hint on the pytest output saying to make sure modules/packages have valid python names. What makes them invalid names?
204,2017-07-12T11:27:38.156965,Junita,"my guess is there’s something different about the environment, which beyond the general wisdom of OS issues would ensure that general setup is the same (python version, dependency versions, etc)"
204,2017-07-12T11:28:20.185676,Noemi,"Hmm alright, I guess I'll have to keep looking into it"
204,2017-07-12T11:40:02.656626,Noemi,Same error when I execute the python file directly without the pytest runner
204,2017-07-12T11:41:19.707586,Junita,"to a degree that makes sense, `base` is not in the same directory"
204,2017-07-12T11:41:27.712667,Junita,test runners will usually do a little magic to make all this work though
204,2017-07-12T11:41:42.722996,Noemi,"Yeah, the same approach works in my other test suite"
204,2017-07-12T11:41:50.728069,Junita,"essentially, they’ll add your project root to your `PYTHONPATH`"
204,2017-07-12T11:46:34.915790,Noemi,That shouldn't be something I need to do manually though right?
204,2017-07-12T11:50:35.074284,Junita,"no it often is taken care of automatically, but I haven’t really used pytest much because I’m a relic and nobody told me that nose wasn’t a thing anymore"
204,2017-07-12T12:07:55.757119,Noemi,<@Junita> well I just spun up a VM with the same OS as our dev server and I am seeing the error there too. Now to figure out what's causing it
204,2017-07-12T12:10:48.864123,Junita,"yeah I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s an environment configuration issues rather than strictly an OS issue, but that does sort of bring out a strength of something like Docker - not just that the OS is the same but the environment is configured the same"
204,2017-07-12T12:11:00.872361,Junita,"because otherwise yeah, you end up spending time chasing down stuff like this"
204,2017-07-12T12:11:10.878231,Junita,doesn’t resolve the problem though.  :confused:
204,2017-07-12T13:30:36.685712,Noemi,"<@Junita> okay, so I think PyCharm must doing something to resolve the import paths for me. The code, which also errors out on the command line of the VM I created runs in the PyCharm debugger. When I print out sys.path I see the path I am trying to import from though, so I really don't know..."
204,2017-07-12T13:31:13.707908,Junita,"ah, yeah, that might do it"
204,2017-07-12T13:31:34.720387,Noemi,"But again, I don't know why the same isn't happening with my other test suite"
204,2017-07-12T13:32:51.766416,Junita,is the other test suite within the same hierarchy?
204,2017-07-12T13:40:41.040564,Noemi,"Yeah, both on the desktop of my dev box and both in the Jenkins home directory on the dev server"
204,2017-07-12T13:42:15.093821,Noemi,"Alright, at pycharm &gt; run &gt; edit configurations if I uncheck Add content roots to PYTHONPATH, it fails from the IDE as well"
204,2017-07-12T13:42:33.104546,Noemi,Now we're getting somewhere
204,2017-07-12T13:43:39.142771,Noemi,I think...
204,2017-07-12T13:44:46.182012,Beula,Have you tried with `python -m pytest` instead of `pytest`?
204,2017-07-12T13:45:43.215871,Beula,"That said, with `pytest` you may be better served using fixtures instead of base classes for a few reasons:

1. It doesn't need to be importable
2. It allows you to test the library code and the installed code (depending on how you invoke it)
3. Tests are simpler being functions, IMO"
204,2017-07-12T13:51:03.405157,Noemi,"From the file I was trying to import into, I commented everything out including the import statement, printed out sys.path and ran just that script from the command line with pytest. Sure enough, the directory I was trying to import from was not there, so it looks like if I want to keep using my current method, I need to add it manually"
204,2017-07-12T13:52:39.463033,Noemi,"<@Beula> I have not really done much with fixtures before, but in this case it sounds like it could work since currently the only thing I have in my base are some values and a method that generates a key from them using hashlib"
204,2017-07-12T13:53:10.481803,Noemi,"Also, you make a good point about functions vs classes"
204,2017-07-12T13:53:18.486835,Noemi,For tests
204,2017-07-12T13:53:27.492462,Beula,"<@Detra> has a book about testing with pytest, maybe worth the look."

209,2017-07-13T03:36:52.066594,Tristan,"Hi folks, I ask yet but I can’t find resolution. Some advice I need. I have script with some export of data which collecting data over API. To work correctly over API I must to get some seurity key over API, that key expires after 2 hours. That script open HTTP server and listen on some address. Because is work as server I have
```while True:
            time.sleep(15)

               collecting data command
                collecting data command````
But after 2 hours I need to start function to collect new API secure key.
How to resolve that ?
I tryed to add variable ```wakeup = time.time()``` and to add in while loop 
```if wakeup - time.time() &gt; 7200:
              api_key()```
but I understand that can’t work on this way. :disappointed:"
209,2017-07-13T03:54:10.395331,Gabriele,"<@Tristan>  That last way will work, if you do the expression the right way around"
209,2017-07-13T03:54:26.400647,Gabriele,`time_elapsed = time.time() - start_time`
209,2017-07-13T03:55:34.423393,Gabriele,another way is just to wrap your usual requests in a function that will request the new API key and re-request if necessary
209,2017-07-13T04:05:02.624972,Tristan,"<@Gabriele> How to integrate that in
```while True:
        time.sleep(15)```

The best way is to restart whole script after 2 hours, but I don’t want to use cron.
Do you have some idea ?"
209,2017-07-13T04:06:58.665782,Gabriele,wrap that script in another script that re-runs it until it's killed?
209,2017-07-13T04:07:27.675830,Gabriele,and just have the inner script quit out after 2 hours. Although I don't see why you need to restart the script
209,2017-07-13T04:10:50.747046,Tristan,How to integrate ```time_elapsed = time.time() - start_time``` in my while loop ?
209,2017-07-13T04:12:03.773080,Gabriele,"How do you think? That tells you how long has passed. When a certain time has passed, you'll want to break out of the loop (if you want to restart the script), or get a new token/key (if you don't)"
209,2017-07-13T04:14:12.818088,Tristan,"sorry I’m newbie in python. Can I add this in while loope whith if, and when certain time has passed to call my function for new key ?"
209,2017-07-13T04:15:47.851871,Gabriele,"Before the loop, when you get the token for the first time: `start_time = time.time()`"
209,2017-07-13T04:16:38.870241,Gabriele,"And in the loop, before each request:
```
if time.time() - start_time &gt;= 7200:
    api_key()
```"
209,2017-07-13T04:17:06.880313,Gabriele,"You'll probably want a value lower than 7200 anyway, because waiting until the last second means you might get a failed request at the end"
209,2017-07-13T04:18:41.914582,Tristan,"kylotan, thank you."
209,2017-07-13T04:20:25.953019,Gabriele,"(also, test it with a number like 60, so you don't have to wait 2 hours to see if it's correct or not!)"
209,2017-07-13T04:20:27.953872,Gabriele,No problem.
209,2017-07-13T04:25:27.062722,Tristan,<@Gabriele> Of course. Thank’s :wink:
209,2017-07-13T04:41:13.417756,Tristan,"<@Gabriele> Do you have some idea ?
I added start_time variable before loop, and added this in loop. My loop now looks:
```while True:
        if time.time() - start_time &gt;= 60:
            get_key()

        time.sleep(15)```
When I start script, after 60 seconds scripts run get_key function what is good, but then on after each 15 second again."
209,2017-07-13T04:49:08.597643,Gabriele,"ah, of course. you'll need to reset start_time to time.time whenever you get a new key."
209,2017-07-13T04:51:29.652658,Tristan,"I supposed, but how I can to do that in this if statement ?"
209,2017-07-13T04:53:09.691340,Tristan,<@Gabriele>
209,2017-07-13T04:54:26.720718,Tristan,Can I only to add again ```start_time = time.time()``` in this if statement ?
209,2017-07-13T04:54:29.721585,Gabriele,yes
209,2017-07-13T04:54:37.724722,Tristan,cool !
209,2017-07-13T04:55:21.740872,Gabriele,"you could probably improve the code by setting that time inside the get_key function, so that you don't need it in the if statement"
209,2017-07-13T04:58:11.805767,Tristan,"yes, I thinking about that. Thank you <@Gabriele> I will test !"

210,2017-07-13T04:33:36.245174,Vada,<@Thomasina> I'm guessing it is probably module:function

211,2017-07-13T05:18:47.274189,Suellen,is there a directory named migrations after init?
211,2017-07-13T05:21:17.332279,Suellen,`app/migrations`...
211,2017-07-13T05:21:27.336072,Suellen,maybe it was expected in the root directory
211,2017-07-13T05:21:49.344643,Thomasina,But I have no idea why it's doing that since last time I used `init` this problem didn't occur and I changed literally nothing...
211,2017-07-13T05:22:15.354312,Suellen,"no idea, but now I'm afraid to update flask-migrate"
211,2017-07-13T05:22:26.358345,Thomasina,Only difference is this is on a new server
211,2017-07-13T05:22:37.362807,Thomasina,Oh...maybe they changed something? Hmm...
211,2017-07-13T05:24:45.412162,Thomasina,I guess not. I tried running it locally rather than on Heroku and it worked as expected.
211,2017-07-13T05:43:24.834490,Thomasina,"Running locally it uses `/migrations/`, on Heroku it uses `/app/migrations/` :neutral_face:"
211,2017-07-13T05:43:29.836297,Thomasina,Just confirmed it
211,2017-07-13T05:45:57.890842,Suellen,Environment variables?
211,2017-07-13T05:50:21.988532,Thomasina,"<@Suellen> I'm not sure, but checking on Heroku the `app` folder does indeed contain my application and there is no `migrations` folder in it even though the log up there says otherwise."
211,2017-07-13T07:54:56.364471,Thomasina,So if I run the Python scripts while inside bash on the server it works perfectly...weird
212,2017-07-13T07:57:21.410639,Meg,I suppose this is one of the reasons why I'd avoid managed PAAS if possible
212,2017-07-13T07:57:29.413168,Meg,DO/AWS over Heroku
212,2017-07-13T08:11:11.691509,Thomasina,"<@Meg> Well, I'm using Heroku because with lower traffic it's cheaper, and because AWS would take longer to learn and I probably don't have enough time with this project"
212,2017-07-13T08:11:54.706943,Meg,"true, AWS/DO require you to have a good amount of knowledge/time to learn beforehand"
212,2017-07-13T08:12:44.724322,Meg,and that's a selling point of heroku
212,2017-07-13T08:12:48.725643,Thomasina,"Ya, I mean, I will use AWS eventually, but when I have the time to learn its ins and outs. Actually I started with AWS but switched to Heroku once I realized the complexity, haha"
212,2017-07-13T08:12:56.728210,Meg,but don't forget they're built on top of AWS
212,2017-07-13T08:13:07.731776,Meg,so you're actually using AWS services through Heroku
212,2017-07-13T08:13:39.742642,Thomasina,"I'm surprised they're allowed to make a product with AWS that competes with AWS, but I guess it's because anyone who pays for Heroku pays indirectly for AWS."
212,2017-07-13T08:15:50.789009,Meg,correct
212,2017-07-13T08:15:56.791297,Meg,and AWS really doesn't care about that
212,2017-07-13T08:16:11.796766,Meg,since more customers for Heroku means more services Heroku pays them for
212,2017-07-13T08:16:31.803786,Meg,and its a useful service
212,2017-07-13T08:16:54.811633,Meg,I think things would be different if heroku were provider-agnostic
212,2017-07-13T08:17:07.816423,Meg,"eg, pick between Azure, AWS, DO, etc"
212,2017-07-13T08:20:52.896142,Thomasina,"Ya, that's true"
213,2017-07-13T08:45:07.457332,Thomasina,"So, after reading up I _think_ I kinda get _what_ a blueprint is now, except I don't really understand _why_ one should use blueprints. All the examples seem to show either very abstract things or super simple things that don't seem to benefit from a blueprint as far as I can understand."
213,2017-07-13T08:52:58.654586,Gabriele,"I have separate blueprints for standard view routes, for JSON APIs, and for admin and testing APIs. I can quickly turn off the whole admin and testing APIs by commenting out the single line that attaches that blueprint"
213,2017-07-13T08:53:48.675695,Gabriele,I can also mount all the routes in one blueprint with a different URL path with just one change
213,2017-07-13T08:55:00.706887,Junita,yeah I actually have all of my blueprints feature toggleable by environment variables
213,2017-07-13T08:55:32.721381,Junita,and essentially the benefit is modularity
213,2017-07-13T08:58:27.798373,Thomasina,"I see. Then, I suppose the difficulty I'm having is in understanding how I can use them in my own project. Hopefully it will become clearer after I learn more about them."
213,2017-07-13T08:59:39.830398,Gabriele,"_How_ to use them is very straightforward. The docs show that. _Why_ to use them is trickier, until you have done enough big projects that you start valuing modularity from the start."
213,2017-07-13T09:03:03.928863,Thomasina,"Yes, I do value modularity greatly but always felt that the package -&gt; class -&gt; property/method approach was comprehensive enough. Naturally I'm trying to think of something similar to blueprints in any other language but the examples I see for blueprints seem like things that - to me - in any other language could be done just as easily with classes."
213,2017-07-13T09:04:07.959205,Thomasina,And since Python has classes and the like this confuses me.
213,2017-07-13T09:04:20.965493,Gabriele,"blueprints aren't a language feature, they're a Flask feature"
213,2017-07-13T09:04:47.978196,Gabriele,"It's giving you a way to make a Flask app out of smaller sub-apps that you might want to mix and match, or change independently"
213,2017-07-13T09:05:20.994066,Gabriele,(assuming we're talking about Flask blueprints and not some other blueprints... just noticed we're not in <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>)
213,2017-07-13T09:07:07.044823,Junita,"I think an important point is that if you don’t see the need, you don’t need to use them.  It’s worth exploring them to know they’re there, but you’ll know when you need them."
213,2017-07-13T09:07:14.047894,Thomasina,"Yes, I meant Flask. ""Sub-apps""? So would you perhaps say that this is a way of building an app, but having different parts of the app actually be different apps, where each one is coded like an individual Flask app, and then everything is ""plugged in"" to each other?"
213,2017-07-13T09:07:34.057705,Junita,"If everything is working fine without them for you, there’s no need to over-engineer your project."
213,2017-07-13T09:07:57.068381,Gabriele,"they're not entirely 'sub-apps' but they are modular parts of a larger app, yes."
213,2017-07-13T09:08:26.082323,Thomasina,"<@Junita> If I don't implement them now though, and my Flask API grows in complexity over time, will it be a major headache when the time comes to use blueprints though?"
213,2017-07-13T09:08:45.091411,Junita,I don’t think so.  I refactored some things into blueprints on a previous app and it really wasn’t that bad.
213,2017-07-13T09:09:34.115144,Junita,To the extent it will be a pain it will likely be untangling some of the things that have grown to annoying for you
213,2017-07-13T09:09:56.125290,Junita,But with a good test suite refactoring isn’t so bad.  So write good tests.  :slightly_smiling_face:
213,2017-07-13T09:11:18.164928,Thomasina,"<@Junita> Ah ok. Thanks. :slightly_smiling_face: Then, would you perhaps be able to give me an example of where blueprints would be very useful? All the examples I see are abstract or purely for example and wouldn't be very helpful in a real-world scenario."
213,2017-07-13T09:12:12.190742,Junita,"So one example is that as <@Gabriele> and I said, it’s quite easy to “turn on” and “turn off” a blueprint - I literally do it based on the presence of environment variables."
213,2017-07-13T09:12:23.196045,Junita,so for example when I launched a product we had an Invite system
213,2017-07-13T09:12:48.208155,Junita,"which was a blueprint, and we were able to turn on and off the need for invites via a simple environment variable change, no need to rebuild and redeploy."
213,2017-07-13T09:13:10.218730,Junita,that’s perhaps a pretty niche example of a concrete use though - I really think the modularity is the real benefit.
213,2017-07-13T09:13:42.234202,Junita,"Things just are cleaner and easier to work with, reason about, etc. when working with them, in my opinion.   But that’s a bit more subjective"
213,2017-07-13T09:14:47.266210,Thomasina,Would that be very different from a simple `if os.environ['INVITE_PAGE'] == 1:` in the code for the endpoint where the page would be though?
213,2017-07-13T09:15:11.278218,Gabriele,you'd have to add that for every single endpoint
213,2017-07-13T09:15:24.284901,Thomasina,"Oh, good point! (pun intended :wink: )"
213,2017-07-13T09:16:03.304540,Junita,"Right, as well as any other associated stuff you’ve done."
213,2017-07-13T09:20:27.437861,Thomasina,"I'm using Flask-Restful which means that the various methods for endpoints (POST, GET, PATCH, etc.) are grouped into classes. However it does feel a bit messy since that means `/users/`, `/users/&lt;user_id&gt;/`, `/users/auth/`, `/users/&lt;user_id&gt;/friends/`, `/users/&lt;user_id&gt;/friends/requests/` and others all have their own classes (some with similar names...I mean how am I supposed to meaningfully differentiate the first two by name?). I'm wondering if this setup could benefit from blueprints in some way."
213,2017-07-13T09:21:43.476599,Junita,Maybe.  I only briefly messed with Flask Restful so I’m not too familiar with it.
213,2017-07-13T09:25:50.606681,Thomasina,"I'm wondering if anyone even uses Flask-Restful for complex APIs, or if it's generally only used for simple ones."
213,2017-07-13T10:38:59.279494,Thomasina,"Gonna use this <https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Testing/> and wondering if it's ok to put my testing code within my app's main script, or if it should be in its own script"
213,2017-07-13T10:40:14.327339,Thomasina,"So, in its own module then?"
213,2017-07-13T12:11:27.870004,Thomasina,`print(__name__)` would print the name of the current...method?...module?
213,2017-07-13T12:15:15.005209,Gabriele,It should be the module. <https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html>
213,2017-07-13T12:16:37.053581,Thomasina,So if my primary application script is `app.py` and I have `app = Flask(__name__)` I suppose I'm setting it to `app` then? I'd test but my code is in the middle of a major change so I can't run it.
213,2017-07-13T12:17:45.093325,Gabriele,"Yes, unless you're running the app.py file directly"
213,2017-07-13T12:18:17.112740,Beula,It's best to explicitly replace `__name__` with a string in the Flask initializer
214,2017-07-13T10:39:50.311894,Gabriele,testing code should be outside the app
214,2017-07-13T10:40:26.335664,Johana,i use flask-restplus and from what i understand it is inspired from flask-restful.
214,2017-07-13T10:41:12.365586,Johana,I believe using a `class` and inheriting from Resource is a the same pattern.
214,2017-07-13T10:43:20.447804,Gabriele,I usually have my tests in a separate directory alongside the package for the main app. But I don't use Flask-Testing or any other extension so I don't know what that recommends.
215,2017-07-13T12:47:34.137391,Jessie,"Hi guys! I have launced an aws instance with SES(full access) role, Now how can i send an email to AmazonSES without smtp {username/password} credentials on server. An example in python or any relevant link would be great. Basically i dont want the creds to be on server."
216,2017-07-13T13:12:28.999447,Thomasina,"```if __name__ == '__main__':
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)```
So this should not be in the production code, otherwise it'll run the Flask dev server, right?"
216,2017-07-13T13:23:32.368820,Beula,"No that is fine, that only runs if you directly call `python file.py`"
216,2017-07-13T13:23:47.376973,Beula,"But if you use gunicorn, `gunicorn file:app` it would not run the devserver"
216,2017-07-13T13:24:25.398893,Thomasina,"Ah, ok. gunicorn runs a specific function unlike Python which runs the entire script...I should've noticed that. Thanks!"
216,2017-07-13T13:27:26.501395,Thomasina,"<@Beula> In <https://github.com/pyslackers/website-old/blob/master/pyslackers/> you have `pyslackers.__main__:app` in `Dockerfile` but in `__main__.py` there is no `app` function. Instead `app` is a variable as in `app = create_app(resolve_config(os.getenv('PY_ENV', 'dev')))`. How does that work?"
216,2017-07-13T13:28:16.529715,Beula,"Gunicorn uses that as the WSGI gateway, it's the ""callable"" for the spec"
216,2017-07-13T13:28:38.542810,Beula,"So `app` is a `Flask` instance, and that is a callable (per how wsgi works)"
216,2017-07-13T13:29:25.569963,Thomasina,"Oh, wow. @.@ Every time I think I'm understanding everything there's something new to learn. I'll add WSGI to my list of things to learn more about."
216,2017-07-13T13:30:19.602467,Beula,you don't have to worry too much about it fortunately - just enough
216,2017-07-13T13:35:58.801610,Thomasina,"Oh, really? Good to know. Thanks!"
216,2017-07-13T13:39:01.904689,Thomasina,"Wow. Ya, I expected it to be quite a bit more complicated. Makes sense!"
216,2017-07-13T13:40:10.945178,Thomasina,"By the way, you have `from pyslackers import create_app, models` in __main__.py but there is no `pyslackers` module...?"
216,2017-07-13T15:04:59.918391,Thomasina,"I'm thinking maybe this is from running __main__.py directly, and perhaps I need a script to run from the parent folder that acts as the true primary script, but I'm not sure"
217,2017-07-13T14:42:09.124146,Beula,`pyslackers` is the package the whole app is in
217,2017-07-13T14:42:16.128644,Beula,`create_app` is from `pyslackers.__init__`
217,2017-07-13T14:42:25.133280,Beula,models is another module
217,2017-07-13T15:03:33.868383,Thomasina,"<@Beula> Oh ok, that's what I thought but for some reason when I run my app - Broadway - locally with Python I get ""No module named broadway"" from the line `from broadway import create_app`"
217,2017-07-13T15:05:26.933591,Beula,"yeah, you want `python -m broadway`"
217,2017-07-13T15:05:36.939466,Beula,"the `-m` runs it as a module, executing `__main__.py`"
217,2017-07-13T15:05:43.943368,Beula,but it sets the PYTHONPATH to be the CWD
217,2017-07-13T15:08:36.036122,Thomasina,"Ah, ok! That worked though. Even though I didn't know better I did think that running `__init__.py` or `__main__.py` directly seemed a bit...off. Haha I'm so thankful for your help and this whole Slack. :slightly_smiling_face:"
217,2017-07-13T15:08:57.046812,Thomasina,Are Python devs just more helpful people? Seems like it.
217,2017-07-13T15:10:00.079861,Junita,"We’re more efficient than other developers, so we have time to be helpful.  :stuck_out_tongue:"
217,2017-07-13T15:11:48.136200,Beula,I am at a ruby job and avoid it a lot
217,2017-07-13T15:11:53.138633,Thomasina,"Haha, while initially I wasn't crazy about Python, the more I learn about it the more I like it, and one of those reasons is that I feel it can be very efficient, to create all kinds of things rather quickly"
217,2017-07-13T15:12:38.162050,Beula,"I use the `__main__` trick to get around some annoyances with importing, python pathing, etc. Because with that way, gunicorn can pick it up and I keep the top level directory clean"
217,2017-07-13T15:12:46.166006,Beula,I hate how the top level directory can get so cluttered :smile:
217,2017-07-13T15:14:24.217834,Thomasina,"Ya, the cluttered top level was something that I disliked. Before this I was making apps with Adobe Air and most of the time I'd have a single script in my top level and then have everything else in sub directories which felt really organized. Glad to know how to do this in Python."
217,2017-07-13T15:15:17.245396,Beula,"I think I may be slightly non-standard in that regard. But since `flask` introduced the CLI, I have been liking this approach."
217,2017-07-13T15:15:35.255086,Beula,"For aiohttp apps, it made it so I could just have an optional CLI to run the application"
217,2017-07-13T15:18:16.338741,Junita,flask introduced a CLI?  heh.  here I’ve been making a manage.py entry point for all these years.
217,2017-07-13T15:26:41.606815,Johana,yea it uses click now.
217,2017-07-13T15:30:30.729312,Junita,I suppose that makes sense.
217,2017-07-13T15:31:04.747960,Thomasina,Oh wait...do I not need `manage.py` for my DB deployment then?
217,2017-07-13T15:32:19.787858,Johana,the click cli in flask supports it.
217,2017-07-13T15:32:50.804222,Johana,<http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/cli/#custom-scripts>
217,2017-07-13T15:34:16.849933,Junita,it’s funny because I’ve been meaning to go through the Flask docs again because I knew there were probably a ton of things like that which have changed over the years.
217,2017-07-13T15:42:16.100445,Beula,"It's pretty nice, for example with the `flask-migrate` extension:


```
export FLASK_APP=website/__main__.py
flask db migrate
flask run
```"
217,2017-07-13T15:43:15.131144,Thomasina,"So I can use this to make deployment more elegant than having to run `python manage.py db init`, `python manage.py db migrate`, and `python manage.py db upgrade` separately?"
217,2017-07-13T15:43:21.134028,Junita,yeah I was always writing that stuff myself like a sucker
217,2017-07-13T15:43:56.152991,Beula,"Yeah, you can make a custom command that does those for you"
217,2017-07-13T15:44:16.162975,Beula,"`db init`, if using flask-migrate, is only a 1 time thing though, just setting up the local config and migrations folder"
217,2017-07-13T15:44:33.171554,Beula,so neither `db migrate` nor `db init` would be needed during deployment
217,2017-07-13T15:52:05.411570,Thomasina,"Oh, nice. Guess I'm kind of micro-optimizing by wanting to combine the init and migrate into one command as well then. Haha"
217,2017-07-13T15:52:42.431625,Beula,I do the upgrade/run at boot each time so it's always up to date for prod ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
217,2017-07-13T15:53:00.441509,Beula,"but init is one time ever for a project, and migrate creates the migrations"
217,2017-07-13T15:53:11.447047,Beula,"so I don't think you need those often enough, those are developer run manually"
217,2017-07-13T15:53:55.471269,Thomasina,"Ah, ok."
217,2017-07-13T15:54:03.475567,Thomasina,Good point
217,2017-07-13T15:54:11.479755,Thomasina,"In `__main__.py`, `from broadway import create_app` results in `No module named 'broadway'`... Hmm... It's definitely the right name"
217,2017-07-13T15:54:32.491210,Beula,how are you running it?
217,2017-07-13T15:54:41.496141,Thomasina,`python -m broadway`
217,2017-07-13T15:54:55.503798,Thomasina,From the module's parent directory
217,2017-07-13T15:55:08.510830,Beula,"and the dirs are:

```
broadway
  - __init__.py
  - __main__.py
```
?"
217,2017-07-13T15:55:13.513607,Thomasina,Yep
217,2017-07-13T15:55:26.520550,Beula,python2 or 3?
217,2017-07-13T15:55:51.533865,Beula,delete out your __pycache__ dirs
217,2017-07-13T15:56:24.552528,Thomasina,Same error. :thinking_face:
217,2017-07-13T15:56:27.554028,Beula,"Oh, there is a `__pycache__` at the top level too - do you have an `__init__.py` in the `backend` dir?"
217,2017-07-13T15:56:29.555365,Beula,That would cause it
217,2017-07-13T15:56:52.567707,Thomasina,"Oh, no but there used to be. It became my Broadway module."
217,2017-07-13T15:57:08.575978,Beula,"is this pushed somewhere, or a work thing?"
217,2017-07-13T15:57:56.601433,Thomasina,I'm working on the company repo which I've cloned. The above image is from the local copy. I'm just trying to run it locally on my own PC
217,2017-07-13T15:58:12.610179,Beula,"Yeah, I was just hoping to see the code to look for anything funky"
217,2017-07-13T15:58:15.611798,Beula,hmm
217,2017-07-13T15:58:36.622944,Beula,and `pwd` has you in the `backend` directory?
217,2017-07-13T15:58:36.623221,Thomasina,Could such a thing be cause by a circular import error?
217,2017-07-13T15:58:50.630641,Thomasina,Yep
217,2017-07-13T15:58:52.631653,Beula,"It shouldn't, you'd probably see a circular import related error in my experience"
217,2017-07-13T15:59:13.642686,Beula,:thinking_face: not sure what to suggest given what I can/can't see
217,2017-07-13T15:59:38.656370,Beula,what's main.py look like? just `from broadway import create_app`?
217,2017-07-13T16:02:44.757919,Beula,"I think it may be the broadway from the `__init__`, try changing the `import broadway.external` to `from . import external`"
217,2017-07-13T16:03:22.778795,Beula,"external looks ok, the init otherwise looks ok and then in `__main__.py` I think the `.external` may be a problem"
217,2017-07-13T16:03:51.794604,Beula,"Usually in this case, I would comment out pretty much everything in __init__ and make sure that imports. Then start re-adding things"
217,2017-07-13T16:04:07.802928,Beula,"I gotta get back to work, I will check back in a bit"
217,2017-07-13T16:10:16.996120,Thomasina,"So I commented out lines one by one as you said and found the problem line. It's `app.config.from_object(config)`. The way I have this set up is that I pass in `os.environ['APP_SETTINGS']` which contains the relevant configuration class (e.g. `broadway.config.DevelopmentConfig`), and it's this that's throwing the error. I've tried without `broadway` and without `broadway.` but neither of those are working. Before modulizing this I just used `config.DevelopmentConfig` which worked."
217,2017-07-13T16:11:59.049794,Beula,"The error is now related to config, not imports?"
217,2017-07-13T16:13:29.096000,Thomasina,"No, still the same error, but if I comment out `app.config.from_object(config)` in `__init__.py` I no longer receive any errors"
217,2017-07-13T16:13:53.108510,Beula,"yeah, sounds like you just need to change how the config is resolved"
217,2017-07-13T16:24:15.430751,Thomasina,"Even hard-coding it like `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` produces the same error `no module named 'broadway'` even though `broadway` is not anywhere in the parameter. Again, if I comment out this line, the error disappears. :thinking_face:"
217,2017-07-13T16:25:51.480602,Thomasina,"`from broadway import config, util` in `models.py` appears to have caused the problem. Specifically `config`."
217,2017-07-13T16:26:46.508987,Beula,"try relatives for anything other than `__main__`, `from . import config, util`"
217,2017-07-13T16:34:36.758974,Thomasina,Guess I spoke too soon. I'm not even sure what's going on now. I'm not sure if the line in `models.py` is relevant at all. I just can't get `app.config.from_object()` to work no matter what I provide it with.
217,2017-07-13T16:35:03.773318,Beula,Even a raw class?
217,2017-07-13T16:36:20.813481,Thomasina,Yep. `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` causes `NameError: name 'config' is not defined`
217,2017-07-13T16:36:32.819597,Beula,is config imported?
217,2017-07-13T16:36:40.823432,Beula,sounds like not
217,2017-07-13T16:38:01.865209,Thomasina,"Well, I thought that was the issue, so I tried adding `import config` and now I'm back to the old error `No module named 'broadway'`, referring to `from broadway import create_app, models, util` in `__main__.py`, and if I comment out `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` in `__init__.py` the error no longer occurs."
217,2017-07-13T16:38:49.890479,Beula,`from . import config` is probably better
217,2017-07-13T16:39:20.906485,Thomasina,"Oh, my bad. Yes it's `from . import external, config` in `__init__.py`"
217,2017-07-13T16:40:10.932417,Beula,"It sounds like you still have a bad import somewhere, something external or config or something like that import"
217,2017-07-13T16:40:48.952108,Thomasina,"Changing `from broadway import create_app, models, util` in `__main__.py` to `from . import create_app, models, util` changes the error to `ImportError: cannot import name 'create_app'`"
217,2017-07-13T16:45:07.087288,Beula,"yeah, because it's trying to import a module, not a function"
217,2017-07-13T16:52:58.330636,Thomasina,When should I use `from broadway` vs. `from .`? I didn't know there was a difference actually
217,2017-07-13T16:55:10.398374,Beula,"you _should_ be able to use `from broadway` everywhere, but I am not sure what is causing you issues ATM. the `.` is a ""relative"" import so it just removes any ambiguity of which package you're talking about"
217,2017-07-13T16:55:45.416749,Beula,"But you can't do relatives in something like `__main__` because the `broadway` package isn't initted yet, or something like that"
217,2017-07-13T17:09:03.820796,Beula,<https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strftime> <@Margareta>

219,2017-07-13T17:12:21.914336,Thomasina,I placed some `print()`s at certain points to see if things were actually executing. After running `python -m broadway` I can see...
219,2017-07-13T17:12:44.925355,Thomasina,`created app` prints _after_ `app = create_app(os.environ['APP_SETTINGS'])` runs
219,2017-07-13T17:13:03.934403,Thomasina,Why was there no error at the beginning? Is this behaviour normal?
219,2017-07-13T17:13:21.942848,Beula,python executes as it reads
219,2017-07-13T17:14:05.963388,Beula,"I am kind of dumb, but in this case with flask you can do:  `FLASK_APP=broadway/__main__.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run`"
219,2017-07-13T17:14:19.970192,Beula,"No need for the python -m and such (though that looks like windows, not sure how the flask CLI work sthere)"

219,2017-07-13T17:14:57.987424,Thomasina,Oh? Was I on a chase?
219,2017-07-13T17:15:43.009330,Beula,"No, I meant this whole refactor with the `__main__` and such"
219,2017-07-13T17:15:54.014375,Beula,It's hard when I can't review the code

219,2017-07-13T17:16:27.029614,Beula,is it working?
219,2017-07-13T17:17:11.049746,Thomasina,Yep

219,2017-07-13T17:17:35.060604,Thomasina,"I'm happy that it's working, but honestly I'm even more confused than before :upside_down_face:"
219,2017-07-13T17:18:16.080024,Beula,probably a flask devserver oddity
219,2017-07-13T17:25:30.277686,Thomasina,"Well, that never would have occurred to me. I'll have to remember that."

221,2017-07-13T20:48:04.880429,Margareta,it appears im missing something in `s3.Bucket(bucket_name).upload_file(file_name)`
221,2017-07-13T20:53:00.939804,Margareta,"i think i sorted things out (please correct me if im wrong)  upload_file requires the following: `Filename, Bucket, Key, ExtraArgs=None, Callback=None, Config=None` and key was missing"
222,2017-07-13T22:52:47.288050,Magdalena,anybody know how I can use jquery to target specific elements that Django automatically brings up?
222,2017-07-13T22:54:03.301044,Magdalena,"specifically I'm trying to click on a button if the Django generic form error element is visible to the user, but targeting the element directly always brings up the modal that is triggered by the button, or doesn't trigger at all if I use the visible selector "
223,2017-07-13T23:47:52.823942,Graham,Guys am having a problem deciding whether to use function or class base view with minimal angular or jquery for frontend
223,2017-07-13T23:49:30.839054,Graham,or start with function base then refactor
224,2017-07-14T00:47:31.374146,Johana,it all depends on what you like.
224,2017-07-14T00:48:54.386842,Johana,"i prefer to stay as close to a function as possible before creating a class. however, there are great times to use a class and really depends on the use case. if you offer up some examples or ideas of what you are trying to do maybe someone has a way they have done it before."
224,2017-07-14T00:53:46.429773,Reina,"i don't understand the 2nd elif condition
```
choice = int(input(""Choose a number in the list: ""))
a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
new_list = []

    if choice not in a:
        print(""Choice should be in the list."")

    elif choice &gt; i:
        my_list.append(i)
    else:
        print(my_list, "",\nelements containing this list is smaller than"", choice)
        break
```"
224,2017-07-14T01:02:32.513058,Deedee,"<@Reina> in `for i in a:`, i takes the value of actual elements in `a`: ie: 1, 1, 2, 3, ... , 89"
224,2017-07-14T01:04:13.528981,Deedee,"that '2nd elif' is simply comparing the user's input `choice` to whatever value `i` has during that iteration. If `choice &gt; i` (ie: user's input = choice = 10, and it is the for loop's first iteration, i will have value of 1), then append `1` to `my_list`"
224,2017-07-14T01:09:24.577563,Reina,"<@Deedee>
what i understand is --&gt; what choice we give it will be more than that i

like if i give 90 and then it will be compare 90 &gt; i  so it will append 90 in list"
224,2017-07-14T01:09:32.578702,Reina,that is confusing
224,2017-07-14T01:09:43.580358,Reina,because else part saying other thing for same
224,2017-07-14T01:12:46.609027,Deedee,"The program starts with a list `a` w/ values.
It asks user to input a number. Let's say user feeds program `8`.
So `choice == 8`
1st for iteration:
`i is 1` and choice is 8
Skips the first if b/c choice is in a"
224,2017-07-14T01:13:11.612871,Deedee,goes to `elif choice &gt; i:`
224,2017-07-14T01:13:21.614456,Deedee,"here choice is 8, i is 1"
224,2017-07-14T01:13:52.619065,Deedee,i gets appended to `my_list`
224,2017-07-14T01:14:59.629633,Deedee,i... so 1. NOT choice
224,2017-07-14T01:17:20.651369,Deedee,"<@Graham> saw you typing, wanna chime in? :slightly_smiling_face:"
224,2017-07-14T01:19:14.669377,Deedee,"<@Reina> 
&gt; like if i give 90 and then it will be compare 90 &gt; i  so it will append 90 in list
No. The first if will prohibit this and tell you that you must enter a number from the list."
224,2017-07-14T01:20:47.684275,Reina,now i got it
224,2017-07-14T01:20:49.684485,Reina,Thanks
224,2017-07-14T01:20:53.685221,Deedee,yep

226,2017-07-14T02:13:04.211864,Carri,"As for simplifying it, it's already reasonably straight forward. Alternate approaches could be changing your `list = ` statement to `filter(lambda d: not n % d, range(2, n))`."

227,2017-07-14T04:34:50.446082,Chery,Could you try to answer me a question please?
227,2017-07-14T04:35:45.463718,Shelly,Yes if it is related to python.
227,2017-07-14T04:36:13.472500,Collette,<@Chery> <https://mikeash.com/getting_answers.html>
227,2017-07-14T04:36:28.477305,Chery,I'm currently learning how to use modules and call other files. It's is possible to have a file named(main.py) and call another file(ship.py). And from ship.py execute a function in main.py Sorry if I'm not explaining clear enough.
227,2017-07-14T04:37:59.505601,Chery,"From the function main.py I want to execute some code of the file ship.py and also I want to do it the other way, from ship.py I want to execute functions of main.py"
227,2017-07-14T04:39:07.527960,Collette,"<@Chery> this is called a 'circular import', and that's generally prohibited"
227,2017-07-14T04:39:17.531194,Chery,Oh
227,2017-07-14T04:39:20.532298,Collette,"`main.py` sounds like an entry point, why would you import something from it?"
227,2017-07-14T04:39:21.532778,Chery,I'll search about it
227,2017-07-14T04:39:37.537730,Carri,"```
# main.py
import ship
ship.some_function()

# ship.py
import main
main.some_other_function()

227,2017-07-14T04:40:25.554059,Chery,"Yeah malinoff, that was my idea, but at main.py I have a function to create a delay_print and I also want to use it at ship.py"
227,2017-07-14T04:40:39.558505,Collette,<@Carri> have you tried to run this snippet before posting? :slightly_smiling_face:
227,2017-07-14T04:40:41.559166,Carri,as long as you don't do `from main import some_other_function` and `from ship import some_function` you won't have circular import issues. Although the import semantics have changed in Py3.x to help prevent circular imports
227,2017-07-14T04:40:48.561695,Chery,<@Carri>  Like this it gives me an error
227,2017-07-14T04:41:05.567030,Shelly,<@Chery> Restructuring your code would help
227,2017-07-14T04:41:15.570453,Collette,<@Chery> then move `delay_print` into `ship.py`
227,2017-07-14T04:41:37.577674,Collette,And do `from ship import delay_print`
227,2017-07-14T04:42:32.595372,Chery,"<@Collette> Yeah, that would work, and what about if I put this functions in another file and call them?"
227,2017-07-14T04:44:19.630018,Collette,"<@Chery> you don't ""call files"" in python. You _import_ things from _modules_ and _packages_"

231,2017-07-14T13:17:43.693432,Kandis,why does it only output one number

231,2017-07-14T13:18:36.719888,Cleta,because hcf can hold only one number
231,2017-07-14T13:19:08.735905,Kandis,but hcf is a name that we give it
231,2017-07-14T13:19:28.746198,Cleta,yes. try making HCF a list
231,2017-07-14T13:19:45.754700,Shelly,"In first loop hcf is 1, next it gets overwritten with 2, next 3, next 6, hcf variable will continue to hold 6 until the loop hits 24"

237,2017-07-14T22:17:22.724440,Rickey,a `VOLUME` is a better option
237,2017-07-14T22:17:37.725553,Deedee,was just reading that... `-v` right?
237,2017-07-14T22:17:50.726564,Deedee,oh... VOLUME in the actual Dockerfile?
237,2017-07-14T22:18:20.728721,Deedee,and that will keep them synced so I can dev on local and updates container on the fly?
237,2017-07-14T22:18:33.729624,Rickey,just `VOLUME /usr/share/nginx/html`
237,2017-07-14T22:19:53.735454,Deedee,that'll map to whichever folder Dockerfile is in?
237,2017-07-14T22:20:36.738833,Rickey,"and the `-v` option  when you run your container,something like `docker run -v /home/lex/Development/Web:/usr/share/nginx/html bla..`"

I'm rolling with the built in template that comes with visual studio 2017, and publishing from visual studio as well.  the publish goes well, I can see the files made it but I'm getting some splash page instead of my Flask site.  Anyone run into something similar to this and solve it before? any help appreciated"
239,2017-07-15T02:57:03.757615,Thomasina,Hi. I can't get the lid off this jar.

239,2017-07-15T03:00:49.771041,Kiersten,What if I helped open something.. i dunno.. like pickled sardines or something
239,2017-07-15T03:00:58.771598,Kiersten,i will feel bad

239,2017-07-15T03:02:16.776574,Thomasina,After I take it out of the can I don't usually eat it all so I put it in a jar.
239,2017-07-15T03:09:05.799867,Kiersten,bread in a can? bread in a jar? are we from the same world?

why is there no data site?"
241,2017-07-15T04:48:20.138787,Thomasina,"So, I have an import error that I've been trying to solve (with help from here) for the past two days and still haven't been able to solve. I'm building a REST API and I've put my source into its own module titled `broadway`. I'm implementing an app factory pattern. In `__main__.py` I have `from broadway import create_app, models, util`, and `create_app` is defined in `__init__.py`. These are the entire contents of `__init__.py`:
```from flask import Flask
from . import config
from .external import init_app

# App factory function
def create_app(config_data):
    app = Flask('broadway')
    app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
    external.init_app(app)
    return app```
When running my application locally with `python -m broadway` the application returns the following error: `from broadway import create_app, models, util - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'broadway'`"
241,2017-07-15T04:50:32.146294,Thomasina,"Strangely commenting out `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` in `__init__.py` fixes the error. This is not a real solution of course since then my app is missing vital configuration info. Also, in this example the parameter (`config.DevelopmentConfig`) is hard-coded as originally `config_data` was passed to it but I changed it to make sure the data being passed wasn't the actual issue."
241,2017-07-15T04:52:59.154252,Thomasina,I just don't get how the line in `__init__.py` relates to the import error at all.
241,2017-07-15T04:54:26.158635,Thomasina,"Also, I put a bunch of `print()`s throughout my code to see what was going on. They _all_ printed, even the ones after the actual `create_app` function runs in `__main__.py`."
241,2017-07-15T04:55:22.161605,Thomasina,"It was suggested that this was a problem with the Flask development server. After running my app with the Flask CLI it launched without errors. Then the problem was that all the endpoints of my API returned 404s, even though there were no errors in the actual Python reported (Flask's debug mode was on)."
241,2017-07-15T08:33:17.933312,Deedee,":open_mouth: Same. I thought <@Thomasina> was kidding this whole time. Looks like something I'd try, though, TBH."

244,2017-07-15T09:17:26.116542,Madaline,Hi is anyone active ?
244,2017-07-15T09:17:58.118664,Krysta,Does sitting down class as active?
244,2017-07-15T09:18:35.121243,Madaline,That all depends on the class. :slightly_smiling_face:
244,2017-07-15T09:20:52.131121,Madaline,I have a code challenge that I'm working on from Google.. they give it to you when you do certain searches. It's a recruiting tool to get candidates for interviews.
244,2017-07-15T09:21:08.132301,Madaline,I've found a few solutions but they don't seem to be scaling up for some reason.
244,2017-07-15T09:21:38.134337,Madaline,I have to find the largest number that can be divided by 3.
244,2017-07-15T09:22:42.138722,Signe,"&gt; dont seem to be scaling up
Can you explain?"
244,2017-07-15T09:23:22.141551,Madaline,"They give a number 954311
and the largest number that is divisible is 94311"
244,2017-07-15T09:23:57.143867,Madaline,The length of the number can be up 10 digits long.
244,2017-07-15T09:24:21.145656,Madaline,Mine works perfectly up to 6 but beyond that I think there is an error
244,2017-07-15T09:26:19.154643,Madaline,My latest attempt was the fastest to execute but failed 4 of 5 tests. I don't get the error from them so I dont know why it failed.
244,2017-07-15T09:28:27.163474,Madaline,In other attempts it ran slower (I built a set of permutations) and passed 4 out 5 tests.
244,2017-07-15T09:29:02.165708,Madaline,Knowing that the number of digits in the list can grow up to 10.. my guess is it's not scaling up properly.
244,2017-07-15T09:29:13.166423,Signe,Tell me what your code does when the number isnt divisible  by 3
244,2017-07-15T09:29:18.166770,Signe,In your own words
244,2017-07-15T09:30:16.171189,Madaline,If the number is not divisible by three it increments down one and checks the next one if that is divisible by three.
244,2017-07-15T09:31:18.176006,Signe,"Ok. What if the number ""decrement by one"" cant be made with the numbers in the list?"
244,2017-07-15T09:32:20.180995,Madaline,"Let me explain more. 
First I take the list of numbers and I sort them high to low. 
I join the values together, appending one to the other."
244,2017-07-15T09:32:45.183190,Madaline,"So 5,3,4,1,2
becomes 5,4,3,2,1
then 54321"
244,2017-07-15T09:33:07.184810,Madaline,I then iterate down from the 54321 until I find the first number divisible by 3.
244,2017-07-15T09:33:10.185013,Madaline,then I return that
244,2017-07-15T09:34:00.188869,Signe,"Yes. So your list is [5,4,3,2,1] but 54320 wouldnt be possible because 0 isnt in your list"
244,2017-07-15T09:34:51.192965,Madaline,The range gives me the iteratable. At that point the list is gone.
244,2017-07-15T09:35:02.193802,Signe,Exactly
244,2017-07-15T09:35:25.195561,Madaline,I do see the number increment down and I do get a return result that is divisible by 3.
244,2017-07-15T09:36:04.198318,Signe,"Ok walk me through the problem in just words and you doing it by hand. Dont use your code. 
"
244,2017-07-15T09:36:52.201772,Signe,"If i give you the list [2,2,2,2,7], what is your process?"
244,2017-07-15T09:37:32.204441,Madaline,"let's use [8,7,2,6,4] as the 2's will hide some steps"
244,2017-07-15T09:37:47.205570,Madaline,so I need to turn that in to 87642
244,2017-07-15T09:38:07.207095,Madaline,then find the largest number that is equal to or less then that number and is divisible by 3
244,2017-07-15T09:38:49.210188,Signe,"Lets use [8,7,3,6,2] since the largest num isnt divisible by 3"
244,2017-07-15T09:38:58.210811,Madaline,That's the point.
244,2017-07-15T09:39:13.211895,Signe,Exactly
244,2017-07-15T09:39:24.212679,Madaline,It has to be closest to or equal.
244,2017-07-15T09:39:31.213146,Signe,"So, whats the next number you try?"
244,2017-07-15T09:39:49.214472,Signe,"After 87643 fails, then what?"
244,2017-07-15T09:40:06.215859,Madaline,"my code is stepping down to 87641, then 87640, etc.."
244,2017-07-15T09:40:26.217669,Madaline,checking each for % 3 == 0
244,2017-07-15T09:40:59.220180,Madaline,AH!
244,2017-07-15T09:41:02.220456,Signe,"Ok, is 87642 a valid answer to the problem where the input is [8,7,6,4,3]?"
244,2017-07-15T09:41:13.221276,Madaline,I realize where I made one mistake..
244,2017-07-15T09:41:40.223240,Madaline,OK the number has to use all numbers in the set..
244,2017-07-15T09:41:49.223856,Madaline,Let me show you my other approach if you don't mind.
244,2017-07-15T09:42:47.228020,Signe,&gt; finds the largest number that can be made from some or all of these digits 
244,2017-07-15T09:42:55.228633,Madaline,In this approach. I take all the numbers in the set and create every permutation from them. Then increment through the new list in descending order.
244,2017-07-15T09:43:26.230970,Madaline,"In this one, I filter the list to remove duplicates."
244,2017-07-15T09:44:43.236524,Madaline,I also break up the sets by length because I hit a memory limit error on submission. In that case the first hit for 954311 is 94311.
244,2017-07-15T09:45:27.240025,Signe,Good. Your on the right track. 
244,2017-07-15T09:45:29.240147,Madaline,"l = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]"
244,2017-07-15T09:46:39.245700,Signe,Large numbers will have a LOT of permutations. So it's probably best to load them lazily rather than making a set
244,2017-07-15T09:47:04.247654,Madaline,it could be a memory error.. they don't specially say..
244,2017-07-15T09:47:39.250526,Signe,It could also be an issue with string sorting vs number sorting :)
244,2017-07-15T09:47:40.250601,Madaline,when I created one big set for all permutations that's when i got the memory error. but this code runs it just fails test 4 and I get no error
244,2017-07-15T09:47:58.252127,Signe,You might want to try converting every sting into an int before sorting
244,2017-07-15T09:48:20.253789,Madaline,That makes sense.
244,2017-07-15T09:49:16.258199,Madaline,"data_set = map(int, data_set) 
should take of that?"
244,2017-07-15T09:50:06.262028,Signe,"Ya, i think so"
244,2017-07-15T09:51:34.268625,Madaline,thanks i really appreciate you talking me through the problem.
244,2017-07-15T09:52:03.270718,Madaline,I'm a product manger.. it's been a loooooong time since I had to worry about code challenges. :smile:
244,2017-07-15T09:53:20.276704,Madaline,I prefer to be explicit in the code but I don't want to look like a Jr. Do you think there is a better approach?
244,2017-07-15T12:36:22.129942,Madaline,This code also timed out..
244,2017-07-15T12:37:01.133316,Madaline,Correction.. I'm trying it with iterator on the permutation and that timed out
244,2017-07-15T12:38:04.138792,Madaline,I think building the list and then sorting it is the problem.
244,2017-07-15T12:41:41.157715,Madaline,returning 0 is something I missed. I'll try that too
244,2017-07-15T12:43:35.167762,Cleta,<@Madaline> why are you using set in line 10?
244,2017-07-15T12:44:03.170166,Minerva,"what about something like (note: you'd have to re-write to get it to work with a list of numbers as input)
```
from itertools import permutations

def permutation_gen(x):
     for r in sorted([i for i in range(len(str(x)) + 1)], reverse=True):
         for p in permutations([i for i in sorted([i for i in str(x)], reverse=True)], r=r):
             s = sum([int(i) for i in p])
             if s % 3 == 0:
                 yield(int(''.join(p)))

def get_largest_3_modulo(x):
    try:
        y = next(permutation_gen(x))
    except StopIteration:
        y = 0
    return y

get_largest_3_modulo(954311)
```"
244,2017-07-15T12:47:16.187951,Madaline,I had started with a similar approach but their verification tool was not reporting errors properly.
244,2017-07-15T12:48:18.193357,Cleta,"<@Madaline> sorry, didnt see the new one."
244,2017-07-15T12:48:31.194499,Madaline,code that ran perfectly in my Jupyter was failing.. So split it up and simplified it .
244,2017-07-15T12:49:41.200815,Madaline,This approach looks much better then what I was doing.
244,2017-07-15T12:51:27.210624,Madaline,This is what I originally tried but I hit memory errors.
244,2017-07-15T12:54:44.227820,Madaline,"In case anyone is interested in triggering the Google code challenge. I've been spending a lot of time searching for Python, crawlers, NLP, analytics, algorithms, etc... This is the second time it came up for me in the last 2 months.. I  was on vacation last time it came up so time ran out."
244,2017-07-15T13:11:55.320151,Madaline,<@Cleta> I have a quick question about your example. One line 6 there is SUM of the permutation and then you are checking if it is divisible by 3. Then on line 8 your yield is the joined integer. Is this a faster way or an error?
245,2017-07-15T12:35:54.127549,Minerva,"for one it doesn't look like your code handles the condition: `If it is not possible to make such a number, return 0 as the answer`"
245,2017-07-15T12:36:27.130316,Minerva,"two, i like nhumrich's idea to lazily evaluate, which you could do with generators"
246,2017-07-15T13:33:24.430596,Deedee,"any number that is divisible by three has the sum of its digits = to a small multiple of 3, 6, 9, ...
So 33333, if added together equal 15, which in turn equals 6"
246,2017-07-15T13:33:37.431702,Deedee,so I would add all elements of list and see if that sum is % 3
246,2017-07-15T13:33:50.432628,Minerva,^this
246,2017-07-15T13:34:58.438219,Deedee,Not sure if that fits
246,2017-07-15T13:35:53.442650,Madaline,Thank you.. Its funny. I never really have to deal with this type of problem.
246,2017-07-15T13:35:56.442888,Minerva,"not sure if it is faster than modulo-ing the int, that's just what came to mind"
246,2017-07-15T13:36:22.445037,Madaline,I can time it and see if it helps performance
246,2017-07-15T13:44:54.487976,Minerva,"<@Madaline>, just doing a modulo a la `if int(''.join(p)) % 3 == 0:` is a little faster, i'm guessing because the other way adds a list comprehension step. good catch"
246,2017-07-15T13:47:18.500203,Madaline,Thank you both.. <@Minerva> <@Deedee>.. I think this should unblock me..
246,2017-07-15T14:26:11.699225,Madaline,Thanks again! Hopefully I can get through the rest and get an interview. :smile:
247,2017-07-15T15:06:55.910265,Cleta,yup
247,2017-07-15T15:13:17.942215,Kandis,<@Shelly>
247,2017-07-15T15:13:42.944121,Kandis,whats the function of the last line of this code
247,2017-07-15T15:14:02.945810,Kandis,i see the difference with and without it in the output is this:
247,2017-07-15T15:14:14.946914,Kandis,"Out[1]: [‘English’, ‘Math’, ‘Science’]"
247,2017-07-15T15:14:27.948067,Kandis,What is Out[1]:
247,2017-07-15T15:14:33.948519,Kandis,?
247,2017-07-15T15:15:24.952684,Cleta,"yea, I am happy that something out of my school math class helped. :stuck_out_tongue:"
247,2017-07-15T15:16:46.959659,Shelly,<@Kandis> It sorts the dictionary based on the keys
247,2017-07-15T15:17:15.962077,Kandis,what is Out[1]?
247,2017-07-15T15:17:15.962102,Cleta,<@Kandis>  it sorts the keys Alphabetically
247,2017-07-15T15:17:40.963902,Shelly,May be you are using some interactive python shell like Jupyter
247,2017-07-15T15:17:41.964050,Kandis,so the list() gets it printed automatically?
247,2017-07-15T15:18:14.966799,Shelly,<@Kandis>  What tool are you using to write/run the code anyway?
247,2017-07-15T15:19:21.972170,Kandis,i see. so the sorted() does not really have any effect on this dictionary
247,2017-07-15T15:19:43.973910,Kandis,<@Shelly> <@Cleta> :taco:
247,2017-07-15T15:20:39.978259,Shelly,"`Sorted` sorts the dictionary based on the keys in increasing order since you are passing the list of keys here, here it is in alphabetical order."
247,2017-07-15T15:21:19.981024,Kandis,yup i got it :slightly_smiling_face:!
247,2017-07-15T15:21:30.981921,Shelly,Cool :thumbsup:
247,2017-07-15T15:30:10.023343,Cleta,"<@Kandis> to elaborate more on <@Shelly> ‘s answer, the function `marks.keys()` returns a list of keys in the dictionary and `sorted()` returns the sorted list. Although why is there a conversion to list when it will return a list anyways?"
247,2017-07-15T15:31:06.028345,Kandis,<@Cleta> mmm good point..
247,2017-07-15T15:31:10.028673,Kandis,idk either
247,2017-07-15T15:39:40.068972,Cleta,"interesting to note is that it doesn’t effect your dictionary in any manner, it will return a list of sorted elements anyways. even if you pass a string to `sorted()` function but if you use the `list.sort()` function , it changes the list."
247,2017-07-15T17:05:03.453483,Meghan,"From <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html>:

249,2017-07-16T04:53:02.701373,Thomasina,"So, I have an import error that I've been trying to solve for the past three days and still haven't been able to figure out. I'm building a REST API and I've put my source into its own module titled `broadway`. I'm implementing an app factory pattern. In `__main__.py` I have `from broadway import create_app, models, util`, and `create_app` is defined in `__init__.py`.

These are the entire contents of `__init__.py`:
```from flask import Flask
from . import config
from .external import init_app

# App factory function
def create_app(config_data):
    app = Flask('broadway')
    app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
    external.init_app(app)
    return app```
When running my application locally with `python -m broadway` the application returns the following error: `from broadway import create_app, models, util - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'broadway'` (edited)

Strangely commenting out `app.config.from_object(config.DevelopmentConfig)` in `__init__.py` fixes the error. This is not a real solution of course since then my app is missing vital configuration info. Also, in this example the parameter (`config.DevelopmentConfig`) is hard-coded as originally `config_data` was passed to it but I changed it to make sure the data being passed wasn't the actual issue.

I just don't get how the line in `__init__.py` relates to the import error at all.

Also, I put a bunch of `print()`s throughout my code to see what was going on. They _all_ printed, even the ones after the actual `create_app` function runs in `__main__.py`.

It was suggested that this was a problem with the Flask development server. After running my app with the Flask CLI it launched without errors. Then the problem was that all the endpoints of my API returned 404s, even though there were no errors in the actual Python reported (Flask's debug mode was on)."

I am trying to achieve a functionality where I can open a `new command prompt` and run some batch commands. Then redirecting the output to a `logfile` and `console` on real time. So I am using `wtee.exe` (ex command: `dir 2&gt;&amp;1 | wtee.exe logFile.txt`).

Choosing `popen` over `os.system` because I need control over the new process (new command prompt)

As I wont be able to use pipe symbol in Popen. I did the below functionality

```newConsole = Popen(
      ['cmd','/V:ON /K dir 2&gt;&amp;1'],
      creationflags=CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE,stdout=PIPE,stderr=STDOUT
      )
outputLog = Popen(
      [wtee.exe,'logFile.txt'],
      stdin=newConsole.stdout,
      )```
I can see the log file is generated and also the output in command prompt (on main window and not in new console).

So please help to find out the way how can I print the output in new console opened using subprocess."

253,2017-07-16T11:31:53.164111,Ruben,Usually JSON files can be loaded with json.loads(f) and then used as a standard Python data structure (nested arrays and dicts etc)

253,2017-07-16T11:57:26.280426,Ruben,"I agree that the *from future* is quite useful for all of the people who use Python 3 already, but I'm less convinced of the *with open() as f* context manager. I think the file object will be closed anyway when it goes out of scope; the context manager seems to add extra complexity and an extra indentation level. However I _do_ think a file context is useful when writing a file as part of a larger operation, so you can indeed force it to close (and flush to disk)."
253,2017-07-16T11:58:27.285176,Vonnie,"I did try python 3 earlier but a lot of the scripts/recipes were written in 2.7, so I had to downgrade"

253,2017-07-16T12:01:04.300484,Vonnie,i can run that in the command prompt and save the output.
253,2017-07-16T12:01:23.302291,Vonnie,would i be able to edit the code and add some more to it? as in to get other data from it?
253,2017-07-16T12:01:28.302644,Ruben,What is your ultimate goal? To extract the tweets from the file?
253,2017-07-16T12:01:47.304255,Ruben,Oh yeah sure you could extract anything and everything from it
253,2017-07-16T12:02:46.309263,Vonnie,"Basically I just need to make the file easier to read so I can count the number of tweets, retweets, see who tweets the most, and do a word cloud."

253,2017-07-16T12:04:12.316806,Vonnie,Yup. That's what the plan is. I just need to get a better idea of what people are doing and saying

253,2017-07-16T12:04:35.318580,Vonnie,yeah i mean that was just the easiest part :slightly_smiling_face:
253,2017-07-16T12:05:17.322021,Vonnie,there was another script which had the functions i needed but it gave me the same error
253,2017-07-16T12:05:30.323019,Ruben,"Counting the number of retweets is somewhat harder, is that mentioned in the Tweet object? If so, you could fetch it and do something with it. Retweets always belong to one specific tweet, no?"
253,2017-07-16T12:06:21.327013,Vonnie,well i could skip that. just would prefer to see who the most prolific ones are
253,2017-07-16T12:07:00.329913,Ruben,"You mean, you are only interested in tweets that get a lot of retweets?"
253,2017-07-16T12:07:50.334036,Vonnie,"well i am analysing twitter trends. have four big files. want to see who tweets the most, which ones got the most RTs, geotag them, and make a word cloud."
253,2017-07-16T12:08:21.336394,Ruben,"Why do you have 4 big files, and not 2 or 6 or 35?"
253,2017-07-16T12:08:43.338036,Vonnie,the script i followed didn't give me the option to make smaller ones
253,2017-07-16T12:08:55.338932,Vonnie,so basically i collected a lot of tweets for trends
253,2017-07-16T12:09:03.339525,Vonnie,the four files are for four trends
253,2017-07-16T12:09:17.340572,Ruben,"Ah, every trend gets its own stream file!"
253,2017-07-16T12:09:26.341250,Vonnie,yes
253,2017-07-16T12:09:43.342477,Vonnie,and those files are around 1 gb to 1.5 gb each
253,2017-07-16T12:11:39.352031,Ruben,"*who tweets the most* -&gt; Every tweet has a 'user' object, and in there is a 'name' attribute with the name of the user who made the tweet. You could use a dictionary to store all usernames and the tweet count. You know, going from the beginning to the end of the tweets and storing the username in a dict, or incrementing the tweet count if the user is already in the dict."
253,2017-07-16T12:12:39.356748,Ruben,"The when the counting is done, you could convert the dict to a list of (name, tweetcount) tuples and sort that on decreasing tweetcount. Then print out the first 10 items of the result and you have a TOP 10 of most prolific tweeters."
253,2017-07-16T12:12:46.357359,Ruben,Or is it twitterers?
253,2017-07-16T12:12:59.358414,Ruben,:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
253,2017-07-16T12:12:59.358444,Vonnie,Either name works :)
253,2017-07-16T12:13:49.362256,Ruben,<@Vonnie> Dont worry about the file size because the construction 'for line in f: ...' doesn't load the entire file into memory.
253,2017-07-16T12:14:52.367146,Vonnie,Ahh
253,2017-07-16T12:14:58.367613,Vonnie,So no need to iterate 
253,2017-07-16T12:17:11.378275,Vonnie,Would I be too lazy if I asked someone here how I can do that? 
253,2017-07-16T12:19:40.390141,Ruben,"<@Vonnie> For example, to show the Twitter users with the most tweets:
```
import json
import collections

twitterers = collections.defaultdict(int)

with open(""stream_BhagNawazBhag.json"") as f:
    for line in f:
        ob = json.loads(line)
        # text = ob.get(""text"", """")
        user = ob.get(""user"")
        if user:
            username = user.get(""name"", """")
        if username:
            twitterers[username] += 1

print ""Most prolific twitterers (or tweeters? Twitter users?)""

for k, v in sorted(twitterers.iteritems(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True):
    msg = u""%s - %d tweets"" % (k, v)
    print msg.encode(""utf8"")
    if v &lt; 6:
        break # We're not interested in people with less than 6 tweets

''' Will output:

Most prolific twitterers (or tweeters? Twitter users?)
KhalidMunawarPTI - 29 tweets
Adger Alam - 15 tweets
Mamma Mia - 12 tweets
Kashif Mughal 🇵🇰 - 12 tweets
zain ali - 9 tweets
Nuzhat Khan - 9 tweets

Fahid Gill - 8 tweets
PeacefulBalochistan - 8 tweets
ⱲᎪႭᴀᏚ ҚᏂᎪⴖ 🇵🇰 - 7 tweets
Osman Kasim - 7 tweets
Maida Farid - 7 tweets
balochi - 7 tweets
Farrukh Hasan - 6 tweets
Pervez  esabzai - 6 tweets

PM - Imran Khan - 5 tweets
'''

```"
253,2017-07-16T12:20:09.392897,Vonnie,Wow
253,2017-07-16T12:20:17.393703,Vonnie,That's really good 
253,2017-07-16T12:20:44.395816,Vonnie,I need to sit down and work on my python skills after September 
253,2017-07-16T12:21:53.401196,Ruben,<@Vonnie> Yeah it really pays to know the data structures and the common idioms.
253,2017-07-16T12:22:11.402584,Ruben,I am sure my code can be made even better.
253,2017-07-16T12:23:51.410324,Ruben,"Do you see a bug there? `not interested in people with less than 6 tweets` still, I see a line which says `PM - Imran Khan - 5 tweets`. How do you think that could be prevented?"
253,2017-07-16T12:24:46.414835,Vonnie,Maybe not include RTs 
253,2017-07-16T12:24:54.415557,Vonnie,It probably has included RTs 
253,2017-07-16T12:25:10.416952,Ruben,"No, I don't do anything with retweets in the code above."
253,2017-07-16T12:26:39.423867,Vonnie,Maybe I can let that slide 
253,2017-07-16T12:26:45.424341,Vonnie,Will just truncate the rest 
253,2017-07-16T12:28:20.431863,Ruben,"The solution is to test _before_ outputting something, like:
```
for k, v in sorted(...):
    if v &lt; 6:
        break # We're not interested in people with less than 6 tweets
    msg = u""%s - %d tweets"" % (k, v)
    print msg
```

instead of:

```
for k, v in sorted(...):
    msg = u""%s - %d tweets"" % (k, v)
    print msg
    if v &lt; 6:
        break # We're not interested in people with less than 6 tweets
```"
253,2017-07-16T12:28:48.434008,Vonnie,Ahh
253,2017-07-16T12:30:22.442254,Ruben,You know what the `break` statement does?
253,2017-07-16T12:31:02.445777,Vonnie,Terminate 
253,2017-07-16T12:34:34.463768,Ruben,Terminate what? The whole program?
253,2017-07-16T12:35:13.466829,Vonnie,Inside the loop 
253,2017-07-16T12:35:43.469266,Ruben,Correct! The break terminates the loop in which it is placed
253,2017-07-16T12:37:05.475960,Vonnie,Glad I remember some of my stuff 
253,2017-07-16T12:42:04.500488,Vonnie,Will try this out 
253,2017-07-16T12:42:55.504427,Ruben,Another nice question. What's the difference between a *class* and an *instance* ? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
253,2017-07-16T12:45:11.515630,Vonnie,A class consists of objects etc 
253,2017-07-16T12:45:49.518672,Vonnie,And an instance is an object 
253,2017-07-16T12:47:03.524486,Ruben,"I agree that an instance is an object, but not that a class 'consists of' objects."
253,2017-07-16T12:51:42.547183,Ruben,"Mjah not bad. A *class* is indeed a kind of definition which says what data exists and what methods (functions) there are to operate on it. However, having a *Person* class doesn't give you actual persons. You'd have to _instantiate_ some Person objects and give them names, ages, etc..."
253,2017-07-16T12:53:41.557055,Ruben,"And in Python, as well as Swift, we can instantiate objects by calling the class as if it were a function. `fred = Person()` will instantiate an instance of the class Person and have `fred` reference it. In Javascript you have to use `new` to create a new instance of a class."
253,2017-07-16T12:53:58.558431,Ruben,In Ruby too!
253,2017-07-16T12:54:28.561081,Vonnie,Ahh
253,2017-07-16T12:54:51.562833,Ruben,So you like learning Python?
253,2017-07-16T12:55:20.565244,Vonnie,I found it more interesting than other languages 
253,2017-07-16T12:55:45.567327,Vonnie,Need to learn so I can be better 
253,2017-07-16T12:55:51.567893,Vonnie,I can analyse data 
253,2017-07-16T12:55:59.568545,Vonnie,Usually use r 
253,2017-07-16T12:56:15.570081,Vonnie,In this case need to use python 
253,2017-07-16T12:59:30.585509,Ruben,"Oh, I never tried 'R'. I was charmed by Python many years ago because of its great data structures and ease of manipulating them. Nowadays I'm also looking into JavaScript (it has become lots better lately) and Clojure and ClojureScript (LISP always fascinated me, so expressive and succinct!)."
253,2017-07-16T13:00:03.588250,Vonnie,That's why am using python here 
253,2017-07-16T13:00:10.589328,Vonnie,Easier to just get what I need.
253,2017-07-16T13:01:36.597587,Ruben,"The JavaScript community has even invented *coffeescript* which is a kind of JavaScript but without all the brackets and syntax burden! It uses indentation for blocks of code, just like Python does. Same goes for CSS languages like Less and Sass, and template languages like Jade and Pug."
253,2017-07-16T13:01:58.599423,Vonnie,Need to research it 
253,2017-07-16T13:02:16.601137,Vonnie,"As u mentioned earlier, it wasn't really a json file "
253,2017-07-16T13:02:55.604543,Vonnie,Just wanted it to be readable so I can analyse it properly 
253,2017-07-16T13:03:31.607610,Ruben,I agree that it should be text-only (not binary!) so you can inspect it in an editor
253,2017-07-16T13:03:51.609179,Ruben,"But serialized JSON, everything on one line, is just as useful as XML ;-)"
253,2017-07-16T13:03:59.609843,Vonnie,Haha 
253,2017-07-16T13:04:15.611218,Ruben,I use *pprint.pprint(obj)* to print out objects nicely
253,2017-07-16T13:04:18.611453,Vonnie,Here's the thing. I am working on a paper for my dissertation 
253,2017-07-16T13:04:34.612607,Vonnie,My supervisor said that I won't be judged for code 
253,2017-07-16T13:04:49.613794,Vonnie,Just the analysis as it's about  social media 
253,2017-07-16T13:05:14.616179,Vonnie,So that's why I know it's not unethical to ask 
253,2017-07-16T13:05:34.617722,Ruben,"I helped some PhD's in the past, (for free), maybe I can help you too?"
253,2017-07-16T13:06:10.620611,Vonnie,I would appreciate it. Lost a lot of time as my father was ailing from cancer and lost his battle a month ago 
253,2017-07-16T13:06:51.623810,Ruben,I'm so sorry to hear that. It happened to my grandparents.
253,2017-07-16T13:07:09.625324,Ruben,<@Vonnie> Another PhD I helped was about <https://github.com/motoom/farasabina>
253,2017-07-16T13:07:20.626206,Vonnie,Sorry to hear that 
253,2017-07-16T13:08:27.631685,Ruben,"I could help you with the hard programming parts of the data analysis of your dissertation, and the only compensation I ask for is that I can open-source the software on GitHub as a showcase."
253,2017-07-16T13:09:00.634221,Ruben,Would you be fine with that?
253,2017-07-16T13:09:08.634822,Vonnie,That would be great. I would appreciate it 
253,2017-07-16T13:09:28.636381,Vonnie,Code being open source helps 
253,2017-07-16T13:09:47.637840,Vonnie,Would it be OK after I get my grade?
253,2017-07-16T13:10:20.640693,Ruben,"<@Vonnie> My email is <mailto:motoom@xs4all.nl|motoom@xs4all.nl> - and I'm glad you agree with me that Open Source is great. It's all for the advancement of Science, no? It is so important that peer reviewers can inspect every step in the scientific process."
253,2017-07-16T13:10:34.641844,Vonnie,Indeed 
253,2017-07-16T13:10:44.642623,Vonnie,Learning should be for everyone 
253,2017-07-16T13:10:51.643184,Ruben,Open-sourcing your data and methodogies fit in that pattern.
253,2017-07-16T13:11:17.645369,Vonnie,Yes will help others 
253,2017-07-16T13:12:21.650230,Ruben,"Now, Science and Art... I've also done Art projects (for free!) like <https://github.com/luismqueral/jumpcityrecords> for which I did all the programming"
253,2017-07-16T13:12:33.651212,Vonnie,Let me check 
253,2017-07-16T13:13:48.657399,Ruben,<@Vonnie> I think this is the correct SoundCloud URL: <https://soundcloud.com/jumpcityrecords>
253,2017-07-16T13:14:39.661413,Vonnie,That's quite cool
253,2017-07-16T13:15:06.663660,Ruben,"Too bad Luis is not active on the project anymore, but, interests shift and people move to other things."
253,2017-07-16T13:15:17.664488,Vonnie,True 
253,2017-07-16T13:16:09.668635,Ruben,At least there is a history of music that was produced by the project :grinning:
253,2017-07-16T13:16:23.669670,Vonnie,That's the best part 
253,2017-07-16T13:16:36.670694,Ruben,"Yes, the Internet (Web?) never forgets things."
253,2017-07-16T13:17:02.672657,Vonnie,Yeah u can't delete it 
253,2017-07-16T13:18:40.679893,Ruben,Some people try it: <http://lifehacker.com/5958801/how-to-commit-internet-suicide-and-disappear-from-the-web-forever>
253,2017-07-16T13:18:44.680168,Vonnie,Things last 
253,2017-07-16T13:18:59.681337,Vonnie,Even embarrassing tweets 
253,2017-07-16T13:19:17.682640,Ruben,And why can&amp;#39;t they get their single quotes correct?
253,2017-07-16T13:19:42.684580,Ruben,"*Especially* embarrassing tweets, LOL"
253,2017-07-16T13:20:58.690507,Vonnie,Yeah that's what makes me laugh 
253,2017-07-16T13:21:12.691660,Vonnie,My main aim was to understand troll like behaviour 
253,2017-07-16T13:21:32.693030,Vonnie,My supervisor said it was too ambitious and I needed to stick with something on a smaller scale 
253,2017-07-16T13:22:39.698001,Ruben,But how would you detect 'troll behaviour'?
253,2017-07-16T13:23:12.700608,Vonnie,Yeah that's why he said it was too ambitious :)
253,2017-07-16T13:23:35.702269,Ruben,But do you have an idea what makes a 'twitter troll'?
253,2017-07-16T13:23:36.702378,Vonnie,So I suggested I crawl four trends 
253,2017-07-16T13:24:02.704315,Vonnie,A person who harasses others and is vile. 
253,2017-07-16T13:24:18.705660,Vonnie,So I crawled them 
253,2017-07-16T13:24:28.706356,Ruben,"I agree, but how do you deduce that from the text of the tweets? You looking for certain troll-words?"
253,2017-07-16T13:24:38.707126,Vonnie,Yes and that's why I want to do a word cloud 
253,2017-07-16T13:24:42.707363,Vonnie,Here's what I did 
253,2017-07-16T13:24:44.707547,Ruben,"Ah, I see."
253,2017-07-16T13:24:48.707817,Vonnie,I knew which trends to follow 
253,2017-07-16T13:25:04.709049,Vonnie,Two of them in favour of the govt 
253,2017-07-16T13:25:09.709509,Vonnie,They are a bunch of paid trolls 
253,2017-07-16T13:25:28.710921,Vonnie,Other trends were full of hatred 
253,2017-07-16T13:26:13.714395,Vonnie,My hypothesis is that the same people are taking part in those trends 
253,2017-07-16T13:27:10.718987,Ruben,"Interesting! You begin with a hypothesis, and do work to prove of disprove it. That's the scientific method, isn't it?"
253,2017-07-16T13:27:39.721166,Ruben,...and are you also capable of making predictions after analysis of all teh data?
253,2017-07-16T13:28:03.723006,Ruben,"Like, what people are likely to be trolls? What behaviour is indicative of trolls?"
253,2017-07-16T13:29:13.728117,Vonnie,Yes that's the idea 
253,2017-07-16T13:29:39.730170,Vonnie,Well that's why I am going for something simpler 
253,2017-07-16T13:29:45.730603,Vonnie,To detect patterns 
253,2017-07-16T13:29:59.731714,Vonnie,If I have time I can do a sentiment analysis but that would be overkill 
253,2017-07-16T13:30:30.734480,Vonnie,As I am balancing exam preparation and work on the project. Had to defer it because I had to be there to take care of my father 
253,2017-07-16T13:31:28.739018,Vonnie,"Ps before they complain, I would move this discussion to private. Too many lines of text here "
253,2017-07-16T13:31:39.739804,Ruben,That is OK. How do we do that?
253,2017-07-16T13:32:07.741824,Vonnie,Well maybe communicate via dm here?
253,2017-07-16T13:32:24.742980,Vonnie,Alternatively email is also good 
253,2017-07-16T13:33:28.747698,Ruben,(Discussion moved to private channel)
253,2017-07-16T14:57:36.157753,Janay,Any idea to implement array and their operations without using numpy 
253,2017-07-16T15:34:24.336853,Minerva,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html>? what are you trying to do and why not numpy?
254,2017-07-16T12:47:34.526885,Vonnie,A template?
255,2017-07-16T21:54:51.319215,Alvina,Hello. Does anyone know host django in aws ec2 problem?

255,2017-07-17T01:21:07.812152,Marcie,"<@Alvina> that usually means there's some sort of issue with the ELB hitting the health endpoint, make sure your ELB health checks are able to hit your server and check your server logs"
256,2017-07-17T00:56:45.631366,Hattie,Hey everyone.
256,2017-07-17T00:57:01.633403,Hattie,I've a Django interview coming up in about 8 hours.
256,2017-07-17T00:57:35.637451,Hattie,Any tips on what I should be looking at? I've only a few months experience with it.
256,2017-07-17T01:21:39.815927,Marcie,"<@Hattie> get as much sleep as possible, maybe play around a bit with some Test Driven Development for django"
256,2017-07-17T01:22:04.818961,Hattie,"I'm at work, lol"
256,2017-07-17T01:22:19.820779,Hattie,I had a good 5 hours of sleep.
256,2017-07-17T01:22:31.822187,Hattie,Its 10AM here and the interview is at 6PM
256,2017-07-17T01:22:37.822844,Marcie,ahh
256,2017-07-17T01:22:40.823196,Marcie,that's not too bad i guess
256,2017-07-17T01:23:40.830353,Marcie,"if it's a junior position, try and focus on what you've learned in your months with django, try and identify what you're doing well and what you're excited to learn next"
256,2017-07-17T01:24:43.838348,Marcie,"ensure you know how testing frameworks interact with django, ensure you know how to write some tests, maybe go over the model and filtering examples again so you're aware of filter chaining and foreign key relationships"
256,2017-07-17T03:42:07.417543,Alvina,Got you. Thanks <@Marcie>
257,2017-07-17T02:54:01.690540,Thomasina,"`/reports/&lt;lat&gt;/&lt;long&gt;/` vs. `/reports/?lat=x&amp;long=y`
What do you guys think? :slightly_smiling_face:"
257,2017-07-17T04:10:46.932418,Suellen,<@Thomasina> first one
257,2017-07-17T04:11:11.939795,Suellen,"there are always gonna be `lat` and `long` params, and this way it looks pretty"
257,2017-07-17T05:14:03.208345,Meg,"<@Thomasina>, have to disagee with <@Suellen>. The second would be my preference"
257,2017-07-17T05:14:28.217300,Meg,"especially with a rest api resource, wince `report` is a verb, and defines a resource"
257,2017-07-17T05:14:40.221771,Meg,`lat` and `long` are attributes for that resource
257,2017-07-17T05:15:51.247182,Meg,but I would suggest definining what the requirements for `report` is... eg `location`
257,2017-07-17T05:16:10.253566,Meg,`/report/location?lat=&lt;lat&gt;&amp;long=&lt;long&gt;`
257,2017-07-17T05:16:15.255607,Suellen,looks awful %)
257,2017-07-17T05:16:43.265257,Meg,so this is better? `/report/90.49283/-56.934`?
257,2017-07-17T05:16:50.267421,Meg,"that doesn't make any sense,"
257,2017-07-17T05:16:53.268641,Suellen,why?
257,2017-07-17T05:16:57.270075,Suellen,it's the same thing
257,2017-07-17T05:17:07.273602,Meg,"looking at it, it has no context at all"
257,2017-07-17T05:17:22.278818,Suellen,and why do you need context while looking at the URL?
257,2017-07-17T05:18:10.295465,Suellen,"`?`, `=` and `&amp;` have almost no place in 2017"
257,2017-07-17T05:18:14.296917,Meg,oh bull
257,2017-07-17T05:18:23.299867,Meg,they absolutely do
257,2017-07-17T05:18:40.305825,Suellen,"As a user, it's more confusing to see `?`, `=` and `&amp;`, then just `/`"
257,2017-07-17T05:18:55.311443,Suellen,why do my URLs have to look like that?
257,2017-07-17T05:18:57.312022,Meg,"so, I fail to see how the first makes more sense"
257,2017-07-17T05:19:08.315951,Meg,location with two numbers in slashes
257,2017-07-17T05:19:21.320255,Meg,what are those numbers?
257,2017-07-17T05:19:22.320835,Suellen,Let's see how FB does it: `<https://www.facebook.com/notes/equine-calculator/how-to-claim-your-vanity-url-for-your-facebook-page/474147772600069/>`
257,2017-07-17T05:19:43.328359,Suellen,`<https://www.facebook.com/help/121237621291199>`
257,2017-07-17T05:20:00.334220,Suellen,Not `<http://facebook.com/?action=help&amp;id=1212376|facebook.com/?action=help&amp;id=1212376>...`
257,2017-07-17T05:20:06.336337,Meg,doesnt apply here exactly
257,2017-07-17T05:20:21.341385,Meg,because `/help` is just one resource that takes in one parameter
257,2017-07-17T05:20:37.346881,Meg,`/report/number/number` is pretty crappy design
257,2017-07-17T05:20:40.347867,Suellen,"no, that's way too technical of an explanation"
257,2017-07-17T05:20:55.352998,Meg,doesn't tell me anything abut what `report` is to take
257,2017-07-17T05:21:31.364973,Meg,<http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api#advanced-queries>
257,2017-07-17T05:21:34.365900,Suellen,once you visit literally one report page you'll know exactly how to use it
257,2017-07-17T05:22:13.378966,Meg,and then looking through a list of URL endpoints
257,2017-07-17T05:22:21.381787,Meg,where `report` can have multiple filters
257,2017-07-17T05:23:19.401724,Suellen,&gt; An API is the user interface for a developer
257,2017-07-17T05:23:24.403493,Suellen,you kinda forgot about the users here
257,2017-07-17T05:23:44.410466,Suellen,doing things by the book will only make other developers pat you on the back
257,2017-07-17T05:24:02.416803,Meg,so?
257,2017-07-17T05:24:16.421346,Meg,`/reports` is a good identifier
257,2017-07-17T05:24:38.428991,Meg,leaving everything else after that in slashes is crappy design
257,2017-07-17T05:24:50.433179,Meg,especially when the purpose is to _filter_
257,2017-07-17T05:25:22.444359,Suellen,so what happens if a person DOES implement it that way?
257,2017-07-17T05:25:36.448854,Suellen,what's the penalty for crappy design
257,2017-07-17T05:25:48.453236,Meg,give someone else the project
257,2017-07-17T05:25:52.454846,Suellen,developers are angry and users are a tiny bit less confused %)
257,2017-07-17T05:25:54.455206,Meg,with crappy URL structure
257,2017-07-17T05:26:16.462767,Meg,then you get a high WTF count and swear plenty at the idiot who came up with the URLs :slightly_smiling_face:
257,2017-07-17T05:26:34.469284,Suellen,but no complaints from users?
257,2017-07-17T05:26:41.471548,Meg,users don't give a shit
257,2017-07-17T05:26:50.474680,Suellen,I could theoretically recite this URL to my mum over the phone
257,2017-07-17T05:27:07.480353,Suellen,the one with `?stuff=thing&amp;other=dunno`? not so much
257,2017-07-17T05:28:33.510501,Meg,"thing about this, you can do what you want"
257,2017-07-17T05:28:55.518045,Meg,"there's just convention, not hard rules"
257,2017-07-17T05:29:11.523738,Meg,"your method to me, is confusing"
257,2017-07-17T05:29:17.525958,Meg,as a developer and a user
257,2017-07-17T05:29:26.529043,Meg,because all it does is tell me this is a report link
257,2017-07-17T05:29:29.530173,Meg,with some numbers
257,2017-07-17T05:29:37.532717,Meg,nothing about _what_ those numbers are and do
257,2017-07-17T05:29:56.539302,Suellen,you are trying to know what an URL is before visiting it
257,2017-07-17T05:30:15.546242,Suellen,"just open the page and it will be clear as day, you'll never forget those two numbers"
257,2017-07-17T05:31:12.566242,Meg,never forget two eight digit numbers?  got photographic memory? :slightly_smiling_face:
257,2017-07-17T05:32:17.588631,Meg,so your argument is that its easier to describe over the phone
257,2017-07-17T05:32:24.591120,Meg,where theres no copying and pasting involved
257,2017-07-17T05:33:04.604821,Meg,and that you're willing to accept the consequences of developer confusion and bad practices for that
257,2017-07-17T05:39:02.727902,Gabriele,"Just to add my $0.02; I also prefer the explicit lat/lng arguments, and dislike having things in the main URI path if they don't follow some sort of hierarchy"
257,2017-07-17T05:39:31.736973,Gabriele,It does make the URIs a bit uglier but I don't think that matters in this context
258,2017-07-17T04:21:41.137490,Coretta,"hi I have a doubt what is the difference between json.loads(b’byte_string_from_outside’) and b’byte_string_from_outside’.decode(‘utf-8’) because I read docs and experiment a little bit but is confusing because but seem to work, which one should  go ?"
258,2017-07-17T04:24:14.187058,Carri,The former will return a `dict` representation of the JSON. The latter just returns a `str`.
258,2017-07-17T04:27:35.253412,Luana,"in the first case may be returned any type that can be represented in json, not only dict"
258,2017-07-17T04:27:58.261061,Luana,"```

260,2017-07-17T08:59:45.566012,Meg,you're storing coordinates
260,2017-07-17T09:00:00.572460,Meg,so you need something with that ability
260,2017-07-17T09:01:09.609567,Meg,"specifically, store decimal numbers"

260,2017-07-17T09:14:16.978549,Meg,if that's not part of your stack...

260,2017-07-17T09:18:09.092084,Thomasina,<@Gabriele> Thanks for the link! This is so much better than building my own system from scratch.
260,2017-07-17T09:18:42.108187,Gabriele,no problem
260,2017-07-17T09:19:01.117536,Ciera,Always check what already exist ;) 
260,2017-07-17T09:21:06.179251,Meg,"yeah, good idea"
260,2017-07-17T09:21:28.190236,Meg,"""is there anything already done for this?"" is a good question to ask"
260,2017-07-17T09:21:34.193076,Meg,saves _a lot_ of work
261,2017-07-17T07:56:02.175639,Patty,"+1 on using query parameters. in addition to what was mentioned, doing `/lat/lon` also makes it more confusing as it makes it appear to be a parent/child relationship almost. the other form makes for sense for say, a user photo, where you end up with `/user/123456/photos/1241241`"
262,2017-07-17T08:50:55.338133,Thomasina,"Thank you all for the input! I really appreciate it. I will be implementing lat/long as query params. On a side note, with SQLAlchemy, what would be the best data type for storing a lat or long? I was going to use a float but I'm not sure if that's overkill."
262,2017-07-17T08:56:09.471817,Thomasina,"<@Meg> Oh, I was weighing the pros and cons of float vs. decimal. With `asdecimal=True` does this mean I'm using a decimal, or is this some kind of float/decimal hybrid?"
262,2017-07-17T08:59:10.550020,Thomasina,"Ah, ok, I got it. Thanks!! Is your recommendation of decimal due to its accuracy?"
262,2017-07-17T09:13:06.945143,Thomasina,"<@Gabriele> Oh wow! I was doing all the geo stuff from scratch, not realizing there could be something like PostGIS! I was still figuring out an efficient method for finding records with locations within a certain distance of a specific lat/long, but I guess PostGIS can already do that."
262,2017-07-17T09:20:32.162654,Thomasina,"<@Ciera> Yep, not sure why it didn't even occur to me. I gotta make that my motto. :joy:"
262,2017-07-17T10:10:48.843957,Willena,"<@Thomasina> you should also consider limiting the precision of your lat/lng coordinates to something like `decimal(9, 6)`.  More precision than that often leads to misrepresented accuracy.  6 decimal places is accurate to about 4 inches..."
262,2017-07-17T10:29:00.504146,Thomasina,"<@Willena> Oh, good point. Thanks! :smile:"
263,2017-07-17T14:14:43.659910,Kandis,why cant i  get the absolute value of the number i input based on this code?
263,2017-07-17T14:18:52.797838,Patty,"<@Kandis> you are calling the function from inside it, but after `return`"

263,2017-07-17T14:18:59.802199,Ciera,Input always returns a string I believe 
263,2017-07-17T14:19:34.821427,Beula,"both <@Patty> and <@Ciera> are right, note if you are using python2 you need to use the `raw_input` function"
263,2017-07-17T14:20:01.836720,Kandis,python 3
263,2017-07-17T14:20:03.837954,Patty,"Also, you need to have `x()` take an argument that is passed in"
263,2017-07-17T14:20:20.848235,Beula,"Yeah, looks like the indentation is off for that print"
263,2017-07-17T14:20:29.853447,Kandis,like this?
263,2017-07-17T14:20:35.857261,Beula,"Yep, now convert the `num` to an `int`"
263,2017-07-17T14:21:33.890105,Kandis,<@Beula> woah it worked. what do we need to convert it to an int
263,2017-07-17T14:21:45.896843,Kandis,i did this: num=int(input(‘enter a number: ‘))
263,2017-07-17T14:22:05.908470,Beula,"That'll do :slightly_smiling_face: Of course, test inserting a string instead :wink:"
263,2017-07-17T14:22:27.920807,Kandis,woahhh so cool. thanks very much!
263,2017-07-17T14:23:01.940416,Patty,No problem!

264,2017-07-17T14:38:16.475687,Thomasina,"<@Shelly> Fact: I have never eaten, nor even seen, a taco."
264,2017-07-17T14:38:39.488308,Thomasina,I think I'm a freak!
264,2017-07-17T14:39:35.520127,Shelly,I have never eaten a real taco but I had once prepared at my place. Do not ask me how it tasted. :smile:
264,2017-07-17T14:40:23.547649,Thomasina,"Oh, glad I'm not completely alone then. I must say though I'm awfully curious to try one though. I'm pretty sure there's a place within walking distance of here that sells tacos. I may just have to check them out."

264,2017-07-17T14:40:49.561837,Thomasina,I've seen plenty of tacos in various commercials and whatnot and to be frank they do look appetizing.

264,2017-07-17T14:42:06.605358,Meg,"I prefer burritos over tacos, tbh"
264,2017-07-17T14:42:07.606210,Levi,<@Thomasina> tacos are a perfect street food.
264,2017-07-17T14:42:25.616024,Meg,especially after an afternoon on the bike
264,2017-07-17T14:42:38.623638,Levi,corn tortillas or nothing :smile:

264,2017-07-17T14:44:56.702405,Coretta,I’m asking your help because I’m in a little rush is for tommorrow my work
264,2017-07-17T14:45:16.713754,Thomasina,Imagining having a taco outdoors after a nice bike ride...ah now I'm hungry!
264,2017-07-17T14:46:17.749427,Patty,<@Coretta> what is slow about it?
264,2017-07-17T14:46:26.754171,Patty,and what are you trying to get to in terms of speed?
264,2017-07-17T14:46:32.758213,Patty,rabbitmq is already very fast
264,2017-07-17T14:48:10.813186,Coretta,<@Patty> something between the answer and the response I’m getting above 2 second time
264,2017-07-17T14:48:25.822153,Coretta,so yeah Im wonder what Im doing wrong
264,2017-07-17T14:48:28.824090,Coretta,:disappointed:
264,2017-07-17T14:50:00.875403,Patty,Is this specifically with the part of the tutorial?
264,2017-07-17T14:51:08.914497,Coretta,I use the same code of the tutorial just change the finnocci funtion for a bot
264,2017-07-17T14:51:14.917284,Coretta,that i have
264,2017-07-17T14:51:53.939909,Coretta,I only want liitle tips like what is faster no_ack=True or no_ack=False
264,2017-07-17T14:52:07.947715,Coretta,how to config the options
264,2017-07-17T14:52:15.952162,Patty,"it’s faster without acking, and with prefetching generally"
264,2017-07-17T14:54:45.039000,Luana,I’d recommend to choose no_ack not by speed but by your use case
264,2017-07-17T14:55:14.055279,Patty,also is the function on the bot is running taking that long time? or is that from after the function is completely to sending back to the response? that should only be milliseconds
264,2017-07-17T15:02:47.316882,Kandis,the specific ‘i’ i wanna get in that range
264,2017-07-17T15:03:47.349060,Beula,"you can return from within the `for` if you want, no reason to keep iterating (otherwise you will *always* get the last `i` value)"
264,2017-07-17T15:06:49.447753,Kandis,but the problem of my code is not this
264,2017-07-17T15:07:00.453558,Kandis,i couldnt get output with the code i pasted
264,2017-07-17T15:07:41.474677,Kandis,oh i got 24 but its the wrong answer.
264,2017-07-17T15:07:46.477185,Kandis,it should be 6
264,2017-07-17T15:08:17.493391,Kandis,after i changed the thing i return to this:
264,2017-07-17T15:08:33.501568,Kandis,then it worked and got 6
264,2017-07-17T15:08:52.511462,Kandis,<@Shelly>
264,2017-07-17T15:09:52.542038,Beula,because in Python variables are scoped for the function in this case. So `i` keeps getting re-assigned as it loops over the `range`
264,2017-07-17T15:10:11.551314,Beula,"If you want to use the `i` without an intermediate variable, either return the `i` directly (as I demonstrated), or use the `break` statement"
264,2017-07-17T15:16:18.739968,Kandis,<@Beula>  what is the code look like when you return the i directly
264,2017-07-17T15:16:37.749064,Beula,Basically drop in my code snippet!
264,2017-07-17T15:17:43.782760,Beula,Those should be equivalent
264,2017-07-17T15:18:49.816024,Kandis,i appreciate it but they dont work
264,2017-07-17T15:19:02.822346,Kandis,i got this:
264,2017-07-17T15:19:05.824132,Kandis,"if x % i == 0 and y % i == 0:
                                ^
TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation"
264,2017-07-17T15:19:56.849896,Thomasina,<@Kandis> Did you mix spaces and tabs?
264,2017-07-17T15:20:03.853440,Beula,I assume she copied my snippet
264,2017-07-17T15:20:14.859664,Thomasina,"Oh sorry, just caught that"
264,2017-07-17T15:20:20.862590,Beula,Looks like what you posed used tabs <@Kandis>  - the python standard is to use 4 spaces instead
264,2017-07-17T15:20:36.871030,Beula,"So my stuff is configured different, if you re-do the indentation to match that visually, you will be good"
264,2017-07-17T15:20:38.871851,Kandis,yea i copied and pasted
264,2017-07-17T15:20:42.874304,Kandis,oh
264,2017-07-17T15:20:43.874507,Meg,"if you're using ipython, just do `%paste`"
264,2017-07-17T15:20:54.880481,Thomasina,Is it the standard? :open_mouth: I've been using tabs from day 1.
264,2017-07-17T15:21:35.901558,Beula,<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#tabs-or-spaces>
264,2017-07-17T15:21:42.904958,Beula,PEP8 my friend :smile:
264,2017-07-17T15:22:13.920934,Kandis,i am using pycharm <@Meg>
264,2017-07-17T15:22:18.923482,Kandis,and me too ive been using tabs and nothing wrong yet
264,2017-07-17T15:22:51.940745,Thomasina,"Oh, shoot! My bad. Although I'm curious why spaces are the standard. I think it seems so much easier to press tab once for every indent than space four times for every indent."
264,2017-07-17T15:23:02.946266,Kandis,omg i still get this: IndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level
264,2017-07-17T15:23:13.951805,Kandis,my 4 spaces is the same as 1 tab
264,2017-07-17T15:23:29.959815,Thomasina,<@Kandis> You're trying to convert <@Beula>'s snippet from spaces to tabs?
264,2017-07-17T15:23:36.963835,Kandis,ah yes
264,2017-07-17T15:23:50.971165,Kandis,well idk i tried both spaces and tabs
264,2017-07-17T15:24:05.978976,Beula,<@Thomasina> - you should make your editor insert 4 spaces when the tab key is hit. You don't literally type `&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;...`
264,2017-07-17T15:24:28.990901,Kandis,:thinking_face:
264,2017-07-17T15:24:43.998614,Beula,1s <@Kandis> - let me convert it
264,2017-07-17T15:25:09.012260,Thomasina,<@Beula> Oh... I didn't even know that was possible as I've only ever used tabs. Good point. :joy:
264,2017-07-17T15:25:31.023993,Thomasina,"Oh sorry, you were converting it? Whoops... :cold_sweat:"
264,2017-07-17T15:25:45.031223,Beula,<@Thomasina> :taco:
264,2017-07-17T15:25:53.034971,Levi,"tabs vs. spaces. I am a spaces person, but I can see why tabs would be better."
264,2017-07-17T15:26:31.054897,Beula,queue clip from silicon valley!
264,2017-07-17T15:26:46.062346,Beula,<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI>
264,2017-07-17T15:26:47.063127,Thomasina,I'm definitely going to read through this PEP 8 style guide. It'll take awhile but I think it'd be a good idea. Thanks for the link!
264,2017-07-17T15:27:17.077872,Ciera,79 characters might be the only think that should'nt be followed
264,2017-07-17T15:27:20.079722,Levi,"yes, but this is serious business! S.V. was lampooning these hair-splitty topics in programming. But to me tabs just bork up my whole work flow."
264,2017-07-17T15:27:36.088081,Kandis,this one gets the wrong answer <@Beula>
264,2017-07-17T15:28:11.105324,Kandis,well both of them get wrong answer as in 1
264,2017-07-17T15:28:21.110854,Kandis,and it should be 6
264,2017-07-17T15:28:29.114781,Kandis,:thinking_face:
264,2017-07-17T15:28:40.120023,Levi,"<@Kandis> can you repost the problem statement? I scrolled up looking for it, and I was unable to fnd it"
264,2017-07-17T15:28:59.129513,Beula,"Technically, any int mod 1 is 0"
264,2017-07-17T15:29:05.132540,Beula,So it's kind of right
264,2017-07-17T15:29:12.136008,Beula,"You probably want `range(2, ...)`"
264,2017-07-17T15:29:16.137869,Patty,You should start at 2
264,2017-07-17T15:29:18.139230,Patty,Because of that
264,2017-07-17T15:29:28.144101,Patty,"…I saw that edit, Matt :wink:"
264,2017-07-17T15:30:19.170176,Beula,which edit?
264,2017-07-17T15:30:32.176741,Thomasina,"<@Beula> Wow! In that clip, unless they're writing Python the girl is obviously wrong from a totally measurable and scientific point of view that is not at all biased by my extreme preference for tabs."
264,2017-07-17T15:30:33.177089,Beula,I don't see any ` (edited)`!?
264,2017-07-17T15:30:35.178466,Kandis,<@Levi>
264,2017-07-17T15:30:57.189534,Patty,"Oh nevermind, you just beat me, again"
264,2017-07-17T15:31:01.191598,Beula,haha <@Thomasina> - the compiler takes care of them in any language pretty much
264,2017-07-17T15:31:32.207814,Beula,"<@Kandis> - They are asking for the actual ""problem"" that code is meant to solve, is there accompanying text?"
264,2017-07-17T15:32:03.223657,Kandis,oh is to get the HCF — highest common factor
264,2017-07-17T15:32:17.230737,Levi,HCF = Highest Common Factor?
264,2017-07-17T15:32:36.241117,Kandis,yes
264,2017-07-17T15:32:38.241964,Thomasina,"<@Beula> Sure, but code that written with spaces...it's just...so unnatural. I mean, spaces are wrong because reasons! :joy: It's funny how I can get so worked up over something like that..."
264,2017-07-17T15:32:45.245124,Beula,:smile:
264,2017-07-17T15:33:14.261171,Beula,"That's one pro about Golang, they have the `go fmt` tool, that forces tabs. The con is that it's tabs :wink:"
264,2017-07-17T15:33:16.261968,Levi,what happens in x=y on input?
264,2017-07-17T15:33:27.267780,Levi,num1 = num2 ?
264,2017-07-17T15:34:01.285660,Levi,n.m. I am looking at 20 windows at the same time here
264,2017-07-17T15:34:18.294542,Kandis,:astonished:
264,2017-07-17T15:35:50.342958,Levi,"forgive me if I am wrong, but if you are looking for highest shouldn't you set your loop down the integers, rather than loop up?"
264,2017-07-17T15:36:31.363558,Beula,"Oh, maybe that is what I missed in the original intention - I thought it was the LCF"
264,2017-07-17T15:36:39.367982,Levi,"yes, they ask for HCF, not LCF"
264,2017-07-17T15:37:46.402232,Levi,this is what I always told my students: read the question carefully - at least half of wrong answers are because the question was not properly parsed
264,2017-07-17T15:38:28.423369,Kandis,6 is indeed the highest no?
264,2017-07-17T15:38:46.432412,Beula,Sorry <@Kandis> - my bad
264,2017-07-17T15:38:59.439016,Beula,"Yes, <@Levi> is right - it's best to walk DOWN instead of up this one"
264,2017-07-17T15:39:15.447552,Levi,<@Kandis> : no idea! :smile: your code should give you the right answer :smile:
264,2017-07-17T15:39:40.460344,Kandis,yea the standard answer i saw is:
264,2017-07-17T15:40:14.477432,Kandis,it indeed gets the right answer for num1 and num2's HCF which is 6
264,2017-07-17T15:40:52.496940,Levi,"I think that this loop will work, but it might be suboptimal for large numbers."
264,2017-07-17T15:41:02.502077,Levi,but that is a topic for discussion
264,2017-07-17T15:43:04.562638,Levi,because you have no way of softcoding a break point in the if-then clause. Whereas if you start high you can jump out as soon as the clause is fulfilled
264,2017-07-17T15:43:10.565724,Kandis,may i ask how did you determine when to loop up or down
264,2017-07-17T15:43:22.571943,Levi,"it just ""made sense"""
264,2017-07-17T15:43:46.584473,Beula,"If you want it a little more terse, combining what I had earlier and what you have:

```
def compute_hcf(x, y):
    smaller = min(x, y)
    for i in range(1, smaller + 1):
        if x % 1 == 0 and y % i == 0:
            hcf = i
    return hcf
```

But this can be simplified even more going backwards instead of brute forcing it:

```
def compute_hcf(x, y):
    smaller = min(x, y)
    for i in range(smaller + 1, 1, -1):
        if x % 1 == 0 and y % i == 0:
            return i
    return 1
```"
264,2017-07-17T15:44:03.593171,Levi,"yes, version 2 is better"
264,2017-07-17T15:44:50.616888,Beula,"The _when_ is usually a trade-off of how many operations are required until I meet my condition. So when stepping up, you *have to* evaluate every number in the range for the condition. However if you step down, the *first found* number is the answer"
264,2017-07-17T15:44:58.620693,Levi,simplification means reducing the time complexity. Because those two snippets contain basically identical code structures.
264,2017-07-17T15:45:31.637738,Beula,"So for v1 above: your complexity is `O(n)` (or that for the size of the range, every number must be evaluated)"
264,2017-07-17T15:46:05.654576,Levi,"it is always `O(n)` in version one, where v. 2 is `O(n)` in the worst case"
264,2017-07-17T15:46:08.655903,Beula,"But for v2 the complexity could be at the best case `O(1)` (for any size of the range, only 1 operation is needed) and at the worst case `O(n)`"
264,2017-07-17T15:46:12.657608,Levi,hehe
264,2017-07-17T15:46:56.679923,Beula,Does that make sense <@Kandis> ?
264,2017-07-17T15:49:17.750719,Kandis,"woo well explained <@Beula> may i ask if we can leave out the last “-1” in the second version’s range ( for i in range(smaller + 1, 1, -1):)"
264,2017-07-17T15:50:21.783524,Kandis,shouldnt it count down one by one already by default
264,2017-07-17T15:50:51.799523,Levi,<@Kandis> I think the best way to do these things is to experiment. You get intuition that way.
264,2017-07-17T15:51:25.816969,Kandis,<@Beula> <@Levi> :taco:
264,2017-07-17T15:51:50.829888,Beula,Here's a link for your reading :smile: : <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range>
264,2017-07-17T15:53:07.870438,Levi,"it's a bit like math: a technical skill rather than a pure talent. That is, until you get to the higher levels. But looping limits, aligning indices, all that painful stuff has to be done a few dozen times before you stop thinking about it."
264,2017-07-17T15:54:38.917861,Cleta,<@Kandis> You should also checkout Asymptotic Notations and complexity.
264,2017-07-17T15:54:59.928869,Levi,great point. This is a fundamental theme in programming

270,2017-07-17T16:48:55.626200,Beula,What have you tried <@Fleta> ?
270,2017-07-17T16:55:18.824860,Fleta,"<@Beula> Well, I think to do it like this:
```
for key, value in dict.items():
    with open(filename, 'r+'):
        for line in f:
            line = re.sub(key,value, line)
            f.write(line) # &lt;-- possible mistake
     f.close()
```"
270,2017-07-17T16:56:40.867492,Beula,Does that work?
270,2017-07-17T16:57:08.882198,Beula,you could probably simplify it a little for yourself if you can fit the whole file in memory and then re-write it
270,2017-07-17T17:00:22.984296,Fleta,I thought there is more simple way...
270,2017-07-17T17:00:26.986654,Patty,"Also, if you use `with open` it handles closing the file for you. For those newer pythonistas, these are called context managers and are awesome"
270,2017-07-17T17:00:54.001525,Fleta,<@Patty> cool)
270,2017-07-17T17:02:27.050835,Beula,"Yeah, the simplest:

```
with open(my_file) as f:
    content = f.read()

for k, v in dict.items():
    content = re.sub(k, v, content)

with open(my_file, 'w') as f:
    f.write(content)
```

Though there probably is a ""better"" way."
270,2017-07-17T17:09:09.247659,Fleta,"<@Beula> oh! that's really simple) thanks a lot, forget that it's possible to replace in the whole text not just in line"
270,2017-07-17T17:09:43.263228,Beula,"It saves a few iterations, but it will load the whole file in - so be aware of how large the file is!"
270,2017-07-17T17:11:43.319264,Fleta,"Oh, it's just hundreds of lines, it will be ok."

271,2017-07-17T18:09:48.786598,Ciera,well it make sense
271,2017-07-17T18:10:29.801278,Johana,this wouldn’t be an issue except that my org has run out of private repos.
271,2017-07-17T18:12:11.836581,Johana,i think if i used a dependency link in my setup.py with the env_var of a user token that has access and format the dependency link url with the token it should be able to pull the dependency down.
271,2017-07-17T18:13:27.862787,Johana,a lil hacky.
271,2017-07-17T18:13:58.873366,Ciera,well if the repo is public people would have access
271,2017-07-17T18:14:09.876888,Ciera,not sure if that's ok for you
271,2017-07-17T18:14:20.880881,Johana,not with the env var
271,2017-07-17T18:15:23.902114,Ciera,oh sorry I miss env var
271,2017-07-17T18:15:28.903776,Ciera,yeah it could work
271,2017-07-17T18:15:57.913907,Johana,"yea, i’ll have to create a new user and give them read access but it sounds feasible. something for the morning!"
271,2017-07-17T18:19:20.980310,Johana,"ok, i found a good resource. i think this will do the trick. <https://github.com/blog/1270-easier-builds-and-deployments-using-git-over-https-and-oauth>"
271,2017-07-17T18:38:42.347387,Johana,<@Beula> travis isn’t letting me put in an ssh key.
271,2017-07-17T18:39:10.355781,Johana,it shows me where i can in the docs but it looks like that’s the spot for a travis pro account.
271,2017-07-17T18:39:47.366650,Beula,"Oh yeah I'm thinking of your hack, make it an envvar, echo it to a file and then clone "
271,2017-07-17T18:40:02.371346,Beula,Travis is pricey
271,2017-07-17T18:40:02.371400,Johana,oh ok.
271,2017-07-17T18:40:34.381222,Beula,Maybe make a basic auth user and use https 
271,2017-07-17T18:40:57.388025,Beula,Then in the before process stripe in the creds 
271,2017-07-17T18:41:43.401948,Johana,yea i found this too. i think you commented @nerdwaller. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4830856/is-it-possible-to-use-pip-to-install-a-package-from-a-private-github-repository#comment55105837_27901245>

271,2017-07-17T18:53:17.608045,Beula,Give the question in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> some time before broadening the ask
271,2017-07-17T18:53:46.616244,Tyrell,"Okey, I will delete one. Should I delete in Django or here?"
271,2017-07-17T18:54:41.632444,Beula,"If it's Django specific, I'd leave the question there. If you don't get any traction within a few hours, then you can share the question here (note the share tip, per the intro doc, vs copy/paste)."
271,2017-07-17T18:55:00.637982,Beula,In case you need the intro doc :point_up::skin-tone-4: 
271,2017-07-17T18:58:32.697027,Tyrell,"Okey, so in the future I will post my question in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> at first. After some time without response I will paste it here. Is it a good habit?"
271,2017-07-17T18:58:46.700995,Ciera,:thumbsup:
271,2017-07-17T19:02:09.762137,Beula,"minor correction, ""share"" it here :slightly_smiling_face: <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/203274767-Share-messages-in-Slack>"
272,2017-07-17T18:31:37.217757,Beula,I'd guess you can just use an ssh key with access to the repo
273,2017-07-17T18:59:00.705082,Tyrell,Thanks for quick intro.
274,2017-07-17T20:36:12.130497,Kiersten,"Hmmm... I have a list of dictionaries that I need to merge but sum one of the keys. Need some direction. My Monday brain is not working efficiently.
Something like this
```
# start with
[
    {'first': 'Frank', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 2},
    {'first': 'Jane', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 3},
    {'first': 'Frank', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 2}
]

# end with
[
    {'first': 'Frank', 'val': 24, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 2},
    {'first': 'Jane', 'val': 12, 'last': 'Jones', 'id': 3}
]
```"
274,2017-07-17T20:50:03.298264,Beula,<@Kiersten> - is the merge based on the `id` field (or a grouping of the values)? Also does order matter?
274,2017-07-17T20:53:35.340314,Kiersten,"order does not matter, i just need to sum the ""val"", every other piece of data is the same, the id will always be the same"
274,2017-07-17T20:54:03.345874,Kiersten,"so yes, on the `id` field"
274,2017-07-17T20:55:07.359647,Kiersten,"With my real data, I am merging on a unique string code"
274,2017-07-17T20:59:57.419776,Beula,"I would probably use a dict if the dataset is small enough:

```
cache = {}
for item in my_list:
    if item['id'] not in cache.keys():
        cache[item['id']] = item
    else:
        cache[item['id']]['val'] += item['val']
```"
274,2017-07-17T21:10:05.546909,Kiersten,"That complicates things later on when I split the list in two by a column value of True/False, but I suppose I can work around that.
Thanks for taking a look <@Beula> :taco:"
274,2017-07-17T21:12:10.572079,Beula,"Yeah it's a little awkward, but at the end I meant to print `cache.values()` "
274,2017-07-17T21:18:37.651005,Kiersten,"<@Beula> Right of course... it's been a long day for me too.
That works great, when the data gets too large I'll adjust as necessary."
274,2017-07-17T21:29:22.778386,Beula,"Good call on not pre-optimizing too much! I am sure there is some really terse and cool trick, but I like simple :smile:"

276,2017-07-18T09:24:18.568453,Helene,can anyone help ?
276,2017-07-18T09:25:37.611896,Ciera,I'm sure someone can help but you'll need to post more details :slightly_smiling_face:
276,2017-07-18T09:29:47.751384,Helene,I am using google cloud endpoints along with ndb datastore .
276,2017-07-18T09:30:07.762820,Helene,I am setting values in my request class parameters
276,2017-07-18T09:30:17.768704,Helene,can then I put these data in ndb
276,2017-07-18T09:30:29.775943,Helene,my api know the value of the variable
276,2017-07-18T09:30:39.781690,Helene,but right after I put
276,2017-07-18T09:30:53.789985,Helene,_post_put_hook function is called
276,2017-07-18T09:31:03.796004,Helene,but it does not know the value of that variable
276,2017-07-18T09:33:26.879284,Ciera,Sorry I have never used google could endpoints so I can't really help you :confused:
276,2017-07-18T10:04:42.014551,Karie,<@Helene> can you post a snippet of your code ?
277,2017-07-18T11:07:22.516719,Johana,so i started using fantastical and i really like it but want to integrate other services. they didn’t make this very easy =(. to parse text outside of fantastical it says to type this: `<x-fantastical2://parse?s=Sentence> goes here` i tried this in a browser to no avail. does anyone know where i can type this sort of thing into osx?
277,2017-07-18T11:07:48.533827,Johana,i’ve tried spotlight but that didn’t work either.
277,2017-07-18T11:18:51.980597,Myong,Anyone have a simple to use GUI?
277,2017-07-18T11:19:20.999974,Beula,HTML?
277,2017-07-18T11:19:25.002941,Meg,desktop?
277,2017-07-18T11:19:30.006310,Meg,"tkinter, I'd say"
277,2017-07-18T11:28:36.370737,Myong,"Yeah desktop, and I saw tkinter, might have to go with that"
277,2017-07-18T11:28:46.377581,Myong,has anyone worked with crucible/fish eye before?
277,2017-07-18T11:31:38.495358,Meg,I've used crucible before
277,2017-07-18T11:31:40.496414,Meg,was ok
277,2017-07-18T11:31:47.501555,Meg,why?
277,2017-07-18T11:33:38.576013,Myong,Basically grabbing analytics from it for peer reviews and then essentially updating a CSV with new data of progress of peer reviews
277,2017-07-18T11:33:54.586223,Myong,"So I gotta use their API, hoping I can get the data I need"
277,2017-07-18T11:34:27.608399,Johana,not sure this will work but if you used a jupyter notebook they would have something essentially like a gui. they could run your code and get ouput and it be relatively easy.
277,2017-07-18T11:34:32.611664,Beula,"Uh oh, management wants insights... huh?"
277,2017-07-18T11:35:18.642422,Myong,"Haha, well they already get insights. It just gets tedious for the guys to hand type in all the updated info for each week for the last 12 weeks"
277,2017-07-18T11:36:02.670604,Myong,and it has to be redone each time cause each week the analytics change of course for the weeks before also so they can spend an hour updating the thing
277,2017-07-18T11:36:08.675011,Myong,When python can do it in a few seconds :slightly_smiling_face:
277,2017-07-18T11:36:36.693213,Johana,checkout a temp jupyter notebook here: <https://tmpnb.org/>
277,2017-07-18T11:37:44.737473,Myong,What is it exactly? <@Johana> temporary server for running python?
277,2017-07-18T11:38:00.748095,In,jupyter is cool
277,2017-07-18T11:38:33.769483,Johana,"&gt; The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more."
277,2017-07-18T11:39:03.789283,Myong,Hmmm okay that might be really convenient
277,2017-07-18T11:39:20.800799,In,plus it can be put on github and look cool
277,2017-07-18T11:39:37.811763,Myong,Sort of like a prelim thing I can show them when I'm done and they can decide if they want a GUI or not
277,2017-07-18T11:40:09.832985,Johana,you might have to setup your own jupyterhub server but it is relatively easy to do. the jupyterhub server can be setup to require username and password.
277,2017-07-18T11:40:41.853469,Johana,then no one needs to install anything.
277,2017-07-18T11:40:59.865074,Johana,they simply go to your page: <http://jupyter.kbman.com|jupyter.kbman.com> and login
277,2017-07-18T11:41:12.873637,Johana,i have an ansible playbook if needed :wink:
277,2017-07-18T11:42:11.912375,Johana,more info here: <https://jupyter.org/>
277,2017-07-18T11:43:12.953028,Myong,Once I get this setup I'll definitely get that setup
277,2017-07-18T11:43:28.963634,In,"if you are just looking to use basic jupyter, and you use pycharm you can start a new project, pip install jupyter then instead of making a .py file you can make a .ipynb file"
277,2017-07-18T11:46:11.071652,Johana,since it is python the sky is the limit. if you want you can setup a way for the csv to be emailed to them or whatever.
277,2017-07-18T11:47:04.106636,Johana,the notebooks can also utilize `input` if you need the user to type in information.
277,2017-07-18T11:47:24.120206,Johana,"so if you wanted to run a cli script inside the notebook and prompt them for their name, etc, you can do that."
277,2017-07-18T12:02:06.703134,Myong,That might actually be super convenient
277,2017-07-18T12:23:20.482464,Myong,Oh man this should be fun. The documentation for this API is leading me to 404 errors.
278,2017-07-18T12:57:53.705173,Beula,TIL ipython does input
278,2017-07-18T12:58:09.714563,Beula,<@Johana> can you show live terminal output in there?
278,2017-07-18T12:58:21.721680,Johana,what do you mean live?
278,2017-07-18T12:58:31.727827,Beula,Say I run a long-running subprocess
278,2017-07-18T12:58:52.740515,Johana,hmmm… idk. i would have to try it. you can run pip commands and they scroll out. that’s what is happening at the top.
278,2017-07-18T12:58:55.742371,Beula,Or can you only spawn one and print the data
278,2017-07-18T12:59:16.754850,Beula,"Oh, I guess I didn't think about how they have the syntax to run straight shell commands"
278,2017-07-18T12:59:43.771271,Beula,<@Johana> :taco:
278,2017-07-18T12:59:53.777087,Beula,I totally spaced the `!shell command`
278,2017-07-18T13:00:05.784406,Johana,yea it’s cool
278,2017-07-18T13:00:17.792582,Johana,i use jupyter notebook for one off things like this all the time.
278,2017-07-18T13:00:23.796338,Johana,very convenient
278,2017-07-18T13:01:08.825288,Beula,"Yeah, I was thinking about adding a subdomain to my site so I can just have one centralized"
278,2017-07-18T13:01:27.836780,Johana,i have an ansible playbook if you want to deploy jupyterhub.
278,2017-07-18T13:01:39.844828,Johana,you will have to pull all the the R things out of it.
278,2017-07-18T13:02:13.865111,Johana,one of my first projects where i work was setting up a jupyterhub with an R kernel and other packages.
278,2017-07-18T13:02:26.873456,Beula,"Oh yeah, I love references"
278,2017-07-18T13:02:58.892847,Johana,i’ll try to test it later on to make sure it works. haha
278,2017-07-18T13:03:04.896577,Beula,okie
278,2017-07-18T13:03:18.904559,Johana,i have a vm i can run the playbook.
278,2017-07-18T13:05:06.967962,Ciera,Would love to have it too. <@Beula> one of pyslackers rôle? 
278,2017-07-18T13:05:24.978922,Beula,"We can do that for sure, make it a community effort"
278,2017-07-18T13:05:33.984042,Beula,I'll start on breaking those up tonight if I have time
278,2017-07-18T13:05:40.988141,Ciera,:thumbsup: 
278,2017-07-18T13:08:03.070248,Deedee,Do you still need help w/ this?
278,2017-07-18T13:13:57.274531,Beula,"<@Johana> another reason why rails is stupid:

278,2017-07-18T13:35:18.021327,Liliana,"so i'm working on a small web app that will allow users to search instagram for two hashtags at the same time.  

the route of the app the user is given this form 

```
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Enter two comma separated tags (no hashtag symbol!!!)&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;form method=""POST"" action=""{{ url_for('results', token=token) }}""&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" name=""text""&gt;
        &lt;input type=""submit"" name=""my-form"" value=""Send""&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

Which is processed by this route

```
@app.route('/results/', methods=['GET', 'POST'], defaults={'token': None})
@app.route('/results/&lt;token&gt;', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def results(token):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        tags = request.form['text'].replace(' ', '').split(',')
        data = fetch_data(tags=tags, next_page_token=token)
        processed_data, token = process_data(data=data, tags=tags)

    if request.method == 'GET':
        <http://logging.info|logging.info>('REQUEST ARGS: {}'.format(request.args))

    return render_template('results.html', data=processed_data[:1], token=token)
```

and the results are displayed via this template

```
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body style=""background-color:powderblue;""&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;{{ data }}&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;form action=""{{ url_for('results', token=token) }}""&gt;
    &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""More results plz"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
```

my issue is that i'm trying to pass the next page token to the results page through the URL, so that when the user push the button for more results, ti gets sent back to the `/results` route.  right now when i load the ""more results"" i get a `500` error and it doesn't look like the token is being passed in the url properly because it is before the question mark

```

278,2017-07-18T13:44:21.336656,Gabriele,"Oh, wait, the token does come through - I had to scroll down to see your Log line. But it's not in 'args', perhaps, and that's okay"
278,2017-07-18T13:44:27.340277,Liliana,hm
278,2017-07-18T13:44:35.344959,Liliana,kk
278,2017-07-18T13:45:07.363882,Gabriele,"Also, if you get a 500 error, normally that would give you a traceback, no? So you could see exactly where it breaks"
278,2017-07-18T13:47:16.439586,Liliana,"ah, so it is coming though as the variable token, but it's not something i can parse from the url because it's not an actual arg"
278,2017-07-18T13:47:37.451834,Liliana,is there a better way to pass data from page to page? maybe with query params?
278,2017-07-18T13:48:22.478011,Gabriele,"Maybe, but I don't see how that's relevant here - if you are getting 'token' correctly, it implies the problem is in your `fetch_data` call and how you pass token in is working"
278,2017-07-18T13:49:14.508418,Myong,Working with .csv/excel stuff should I be using just the `csv` module or `pandas/openpyxl`
278,2017-07-18T13:50:05.538289,Gabriele,"<@Liliana> I mean, the main problem with your code is that you don't do anything useful with a GET request"
278,2017-07-18T13:50:21.547902,Liliana,yea im changing that now
278,2017-07-18T13:50:33.555194,Liliana,think i got it from here (for now :simple_smile: )
278,2017-07-18T13:50:36.556624,Liliana,thanks for the help
278,2017-07-18T13:50:53.566999,Gabriele,:+1:
278,2017-07-18T13:51:17.581624,Martha,Whats the context?
278,2017-07-18T15:21:22.744752,Johana,"if the course is really good and the downside is the fact that it uses python 2 then i would just convert as i go. everything i’ve done so far with scipy, numpy, and pandas has worked in python 3.6. google the errors and tracebacks you get and i bet there are a lot of solutions."
278,2017-07-18T15:21:26.746821,Johana,the other option is using penv.
278,2017-07-18T15:21:36.752431,Johana,pyenv makes it pretty easy to run multiple python versions.
278,2017-07-18T15:21:47.758480,Martha,Someone on that youtube video also posted a package for it <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yahoo-finance/1.3.2>  - i havent tried it - just pointing it out
278,2017-07-18T15:21:51.760142,Johana,you could run the code in python 2 to just get it working and then conver to python 3
279,2017-07-18T13:28:23.776472,Liliana,"hello, could someone help me with a flask issue i'm having?"
279,2017-07-18T13:31:26.886122,Patty,"<@Liliana> sure, post your question here (or <#C0LN2AD7T|flask>) and someone will answer when they can :slightly_smiling_face:"
280,2017-07-18T13:44:31.342677,Gabriele,You should try logging what `token` is equal to

282,2017-07-18T15:19:25.682002,Sharlene,"Hello, I been looking for a way to create script that gathers info from yahoo finance or morning star, financial numbers I can calculate later on with python. I have found an interesting youtube tutorial which goes trough the same topic <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2zyPby4034&amp;index=3&amp;list=PLQVvvaa0QuDejNczz7dbpyu3JnwUBvNch> but the problem is that its in python 2 and some of the steps does not work anymore. I know thought that I can convert the python 2 to 3 and find some hacky ways how to do it still but I wonder if it's worth the effort. Maybe there are some better ways I can do with python 3. I readed a bit about modules like pandas and beautiful soup but not sure if they are fit for this purpose. Anyone could point me to a direction what would be the best method for gathering financial fundamental data? I am quite new to python"

283,2017-07-18T15:44:32.482305,Levi,is there anything for which a module does not exist?
283,2017-07-18T15:44:43.487930,Sharlene,"thanks, I think I will go trough the tutorial then and each step do some investigating how to make it work in the python 3 lets see how it ends up :stuck_out_tongue: at least I think I will learn more about python that way :smile:"
283,2017-07-18T15:45:09.502072,Levi,<@Sharlene> that is a cool project idea
283,2017-07-18T15:58:44.947119,Levi,Yahoo finance is the best *free* source of financial data out there. Google isn't as good given the constraints they place on how much data you can pull from their servers
283,2017-07-18T17:59:31.583996,Johana,finally got that stupid private github dependency to install in travis from a public repo. holy crap.
284,2017-07-18T18:02:16.654646,Beula,What was the hack?
284,2017-07-18T18:02:33.661532,Johana,it’s getting the url right in the dependency_links
284,2017-07-18T18:04:33.707446,Johana,"```
github_token = os.environ['GITHUB_TOKEN']
github_user = os.environ['GITHUB_USER']

      ],
```"
284,2017-07-18T18:05:10.721732,Beula,Sounds about right. Nice hack <@Johana> :taco:
284,2017-07-18T18:05:22.726316,Beula,"Oh sorry, guess I gave them all out"
284,2017-07-18T18:05:22.726620,Johana,what sucks is i had to use the --process-dependency-links
284,2017-07-18T18:05:30.729463,Johana,and it gives a deprecation msg.
284,2017-07-18T18:05:33.730537,Johana,it’s all good
284,2017-07-18T18:05:42.734046,Johana,so i’ll have to change things soon… but whatever.
284,2017-07-18T18:06:26.750936,Johana,it works right now and that is all i care about.
284,2017-07-18T18:07:20.771731,Beula,I think there is an XKCD about the future self coming back to warn the past self...
284,2017-07-18T18:08:08.789375,Johana,"yea, it’s already bugging me … but i need to press on."
284,2017-07-18T18:08:25.795919,Johana,i’ll create an issue and get going on other thangs.
284,2017-07-18T18:08:59.808666,Johana,&gt; Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps you from being done.
284,2017-07-18T18:09:16.815158,Beula,I'm on your side :slightly_smiling_face:
284,2017-07-18T18:09:30.820367,Beula,"I am writing a node app right now, pretty much going for get it working..."
284,2017-07-18T18:09:31.820738,Johana,yea i just gotta keep telling myself this stuff… haha
284,2017-07-18T18:09:52.828545,Beula,:shipit: is my motto
284,2017-07-18T18:09:59.831151,Johana,:thumbsup:
284,2017-07-18T18:10:00.831710,Johana,same here
284,2017-07-18T18:10:07.834288,Johana,i’ve adopted it.
284,2017-07-18T18:10:18.838156,Johana,way better to ship than not have shit.
284,2017-07-18T18:10:23.840030,Beula,"Of course my old director when he left said ""you guys don't hold yourself to a high enough software craftmanship standard"""
284,2017-07-18T18:10:39.846030,Beula,So... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
284,2017-07-18T18:11:27.863182,Johana,there is a balance you need to keep.
284,2017-07-18T18:11:54.872896,Johana,you def. don’t want the crappiest code ever being written… but you can also spend waaay to much time on some some stuff.
284,2017-07-18T18:11:55.873528,Beula,"He was really just being an ass, not to be too rude"
284,2017-07-18T18:16:27.971521,Beula,"I think I just decided a new policy, no calling a package/module: utils, common, or shared"
285,2017-07-18T19:49:31.605918,Thomasina,"<@Alvin>
```backend
|_ broadway
   |_ all_the_python_scripts.py
|_all_the_not_python_files.ext```"
285,2017-07-18T19:49:36.607333,Thomasina,Something like that
285,2017-07-18T19:49:55.612254,Thomasina,So literally everything .py is in the broadway folder
285,2017-07-18T19:50:13.616771,Thomasina,Then I use `python -m broadway` to run it
285,2017-07-18T19:50:57.628069,Thomasina,So you mean that it's lookin in `backend` for `create_app` rather than in `broadway`?
285,2017-07-18T19:54:52.687331,Alvin,"<@Thomasina> I see.  Do you have a py script anywhere where you imports ""backend"" first?"
285,2017-07-18T20:04:13.835111,Alvin,<@Thomasina> To asnwer your question: Yes.  It's hard to guess without the full code but pay close attention to __init__.py and your initial app import.  The folder structure needs to be what Flask expects or at least direct it to it if you're going the unconventional way.
285,2017-07-18T20:06:38.871883,Alvin,"<@Thomasina> Once you need to deploy this to a server, you ll need a wsgi script that would declare all the pathes as well. Otherwise you'll be banging your head trying to figure out why an ""moduleName importError"" is popping everywhere."
285,2017-07-18T20:07:38.886315,Thomasina,Only `__main__.py` is truncated there
285,2017-07-18T20:08:27.898104,Thomasina,Thanks for the heads up about WSGI! I hadn't gotten there yet but I hadn't made a WSGI script yet
285,2017-07-18T20:20:38.071328,Alvin,<@Thomasina> where is your `app = Flask(__name__)`
285,2017-07-18T20:22:04.090845,Thomasina,<@Alvin> in `__init__.py` is the snippet :slightly_smiling_face:
285,2017-07-18T20:25:30.136790,Alvin,<@Thomasina>  change to `from broadway import config`
286,2017-07-18T19:53:27.665818,Alvin,<@Sharlene> what are you trying to do? there are Python libs that do lots of financial stuff that you could just use. Unless you want to 'learn Python by doing' type of thing
287,2017-07-18T20:54:45.509715,Beula,"I've never used a wsgi script, the gunicorn arg or config file should be enough - but you can do whatever makes sense to you"
288,2017-07-19T00:58:41.212122,Katheryn,What is the strategy to decide limit for number of processes when working with `multiprocessing`?
288,2017-07-19T00:59:25.219875,Beula,I'd favor `concurrent.futures` (or the `futures` backport if you are on python2).
288,2017-07-19T00:59:32.221014,Beula,Basically you can define a pool with the max workers
288,2017-07-19T01:00:09.227988,Beula,"```
import concurrent.futures

with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=2) as pool:
    pool.submit(print, 'Hello World')
```"
288,2017-07-19T01:00:22.230647,Beula,(untested and from memory <@Katheryn> :point_up::skin-tone-4:)
288,2017-07-19T01:01:16.240428,Katheryn,"Sure, let me explore `futures`. So, I’ll be doing I/O with these forked processes. Reading from the web, suggestions are to keep workers equal to number of cores. Is that reasonable?"
288,2017-07-19T01:02:08.249425,Beula,"Yep, that's usually what I see/hear around. Note that if you are doing I/O - probably best to use `ThreadPoolExecutor` since your bottlekneck isn't CPU and processes in python are expensive"
288,2017-07-19T01:02:15.250613,Beula,Especially resource sharing
288,2017-07-19T01:02:38.254430,Katheryn,Thanks. Let me read more on the subject

291,2017-07-19T09:32:18.847108,Thomasina,If I have a question that isn't really about Python can I still ask it here? Or do I need to go to general or random?
291,2017-07-19T09:32:24.850487,Thomasina,It is development related at least
291,2017-07-19T09:33:25.885286,Meg,why not?
291,2017-07-19T09:33:37.891705,Meg,"if its not, we could probably point you in a direction"

292,2017-07-19T09:44:10.257290,Myong,"No, using a list."
292,2017-07-19T09:44:23.264694,Myong,Basically just taking a 2d array of N x M
292,2017-07-19T09:44:36.272478,Myong,and I have to sum all the values in the columns
292,2017-07-19T09:45:00.286550,Gabriele,I'd argue that it's probably not worth trying to go overboard on the overloads
292,2017-07-19T09:46:04.324311,Myong,Which is easy enough
292,2017-07-19T09:46:13.329552,Myong,My trouble comes in here
292,2017-07-19T09:48:03.395293,Myong,Basically saying that `__getitem__` is not defined for list
292,2017-07-19T09:48:22.406974,Myong,but I've defined it in my class. And it works if my 2d list isn't an object instance
292,2017-07-19T09:48:25.408677,Myong,of my class
292,2017-07-19T09:49:23.444285,Gabriele,"You're assuming it's saying the wrong thing about your class, but most likely you have given it a list when you think you've given it your class"

292,2017-07-19T09:53:01.577000,Myong,The error comes in line 4 with `self.xl_grid[i][j-1]`
292,2017-07-19T09:53:57.610304,Gabriele,"okay, so obviously your __getitem__ function is irrelevant as you're not dealing with that type here, only lists"
292,2017-07-19T09:54:33.633238,Myong,Oh wait
292,2017-07-19T09:55:49.680366,Gabriele,"Personally I wouldn't be trying to implement that logic in a single hairy one-liner, either"
292,2017-07-19T09:56:04.689861,Myong,Yeah i think that's what's broken
292,2017-07-19T09:56:29.705630,Gabriele,what is the _actual_ error?
292,2017-07-19T09:57:02.726362,Myong,The error I had previously was due to attempting to subscript the list twice
292,2017-07-19T09:57:14.733671,Myong,it was giving me a message about the list
292,2017-07-19T09:57:24.739796,Myong,"But not it's not making a 2d array, but that was my fault"
292,2017-07-19T09:58:04.764609,Myong,Works now
293,2017-07-19T10:12:17.300566,Thomasina,"I'm using Heroku and I want to add PostGIS to my Postgres database, however to do this I need to run in Windows command prompt:
```heroku pg:psql
create extension postgis;```
And that requires that Postgres be installed on my local machine. Is there any way around this? Do I _have to_ install Postgres on my computer?"
293,2017-07-19T10:16:34.465784,Meg,how are you working locally?
293,2017-07-19T10:17:03.483743,Meg,"eg, dev/staging/prod with their own specific env configurations"
293,2017-07-19T10:23:44.743992,Thomasina,I just run my code locally...um...I guess that's it. I have the Heroku toolbelt. When I run the command with the toolbet I'm informed that psql.exe could not be found. After a quick search it seems it's because Postgres needs to be installed.
293,2017-07-19T10:23:54.750356,Thomasina,Sorry if I didn't understand your question correctly
293,2017-07-19T10:24:23.769827,Thomasina,I run my app in its development configuration when running it locally. Not that it's that much different from the other modes.
293,2017-07-19T10:24:43.782580,Gabriele,How can you be running locally if you use Postgres but don't have it installed? Are you accessing a Postgres instance remotely?
293,2017-07-19T10:25:19.805948,Gabriele,I didn't think Heroku had a local option
293,2017-07-19T10:25:54.828852,Meg,"it does, but you really should have everything replicated locally that's on heroky"
293,2017-07-19T10:26:03.834414,Meg,as close to 1:1 as possible
293,2017-07-19T10:27:38.897290,Gabriele,Aha. Still curious about how it handles the DB.
293,2017-07-19T10:34:30.176660,Thomasina,Ya I have no idea. I just want to get PostGIS running on Heroku. But I guess I'll need Postgres anyway if I intend to test my app locally. Currently I just plug it into an SQLite DB to test it.
293,2017-07-19T10:34:59.196099,Gabriele,"yup, switch that out for postgres."
293,2017-07-19T10:42:47.504552,Thomasina,"I must say that I did enjoy the simplicity though, and especially when we have new developers coming in. I wish Postgres could be self-contained somehow to avoid having to set anything up. Oh well."
293,2017-07-19T10:44:00.553419,Gabriele,That's the tradeoff though... SQLite basically has the whole database functionality built right into your application. That's only practical because the functionality it offers is quite minimal.
293,2017-07-19T10:44:33.575367,Gabriele,If you're writing something for multiple developers to work on then everybody could share a Postgres installation on a central server
293,2017-07-19T10:45:31.614085,Thomasina,That's true. I suppose I could have everyone connect to the database on the Heroku staging Dyno for the project though...
293,2017-07-19T13:00:48.840446,Suellen,<@Gabriele> what
293,2017-07-19T13:00:50.841745,Suellen,&gt; That's only practical because the functionality it offers is quite minimal.
293,2017-07-19T13:01:15.857511,Suellen,SQLite's Full-text search was blazing fast before Postgres had a reasonable FTS at all.
293,2017-07-19T13:02:17.895380,Beula,Docker!
293,2017-07-19T13:02:42.911213,Beula,I put a `docker-compose.yml` in all my projects now so people can be up and running with it in a few minutes
293,2017-07-19T13:03:41.945793,Beula,"It won't solve all problems, but it's really nice for dev-prod parity, ish"
293,2017-07-19T13:03:50.951151,Gabriele,"<@Suellen> I didn't say the functionality was slow or bad, just that there isn't so much of it"
293,2017-07-19T13:04:16.966828,Suellen,true that

i have a small web app that allows users to search instagram for two hashtags.  on the first page they enter their hashtags, on the second page they get the results and a button to process more results.  clicking this button send the user to a URL with the next page token and the hash tags (required for processing next results) stored in the url. like this `<http://10.51.50.10:42066/results/J0HWW-lwQAAAF0HWW-jjgAAAFoAKAA%253D%253D/%5B%27lol%27%2C%20%27dog%27%5D>?`

298,2017-07-19T14:58:17.020914,Suellen,it's got `xml` in its name
298,2017-07-19T14:58:18.021086,Meghan,I believe that is the one I liked.
298,2017-07-19T14:58:31.029007,Meghan,It can parse xml without you having to know anything about the content.
298,2017-07-19T14:58:37.032560,Suellen,and beautifulsoup only has `soup`...
298,2017-07-19T14:58:50.040283,Suellen,"ah, and `beautiful`.."
298,2017-07-19T14:59:45.072699,Ciera,be sure to use `defusedxml` if you are parsing unknown xml
298,2017-07-19T15:01:20.130773,Myong,Yeah I saw there was some possibility of malicious xml with certain libraries unable to deal with it
298,2017-07-19T15:01:39.142208,Myong,Why does xml seem so much more annoying than json... ugh

298,2017-07-19T15:11:10.462313,Meghan,lxml should really be in the standard library.
298,2017-07-19T15:11:54.486695,Suellen,"well, `xml` already is and they share an interface (I think)"

import lxml

298,2017-07-19T15:13:10.527799,Myong,Yeah I think that the Etree class is shared
298,2017-07-19T15:14:01.555439,Pasquale,Why no `BeautifulSoup`? it supports `lxml` as well
298,2017-07-19T15:14:34.573312,Suellen,BeautifulSoup's interface is bizarre
298,2017-07-19T15:14:38.575308,Suellen,like really strange
298,2017-07-19T15:14:54.583727,Suellen,And it's an abstraction over lxml either way

301,2017-07-19T23:58:31.551238,Katheryn,"Hello, a design question for a slackbot. I’m using slack’s RTM APIs to establish a websocket connection with slack. Code is deployed on a single instance/machine and everything is working well. Now, I want one more production instance to ensure availability in case one is down. How can I replicate the deployment on two machines?"
301,2017-07-20T00:00:19.571001,Beula,You really can't with a slackbot <@Katheryn> - otherwise what would happen is you'd have two bots listening and responding to all events. You may need a fail-over instead where another machine starts up and starts the bot if the main machine fails (of course you would likely have a period of downtime during that failover)
301,2017-07-20T00:01:12.580523,Katheryn,"&gt; you’d have two bots listening and responding to all events.
Yeah, that was the problem even I had in mind. Should I explore on message queues?"
301,2017-07-20T00:03:10.602122,Beula,"I guess you could, I haven't checked for any that de-duplicate repeat messages though"
301,2017-07-20T00:07:17.644338,Katheryn,"I have never worked with message queues before. Can we have a configuration where event is consumed only by _one_ consumer at a time? Or, is it replicated to all of them?"
301,2017-07-20T00:07:44.649322,Katheryn,"But all this sounds too complicated, I think. We only have about 800 users using out bot"
301,2017-07-20T00:09:27.666992,Beula,"I am not aware of a way to only have one consumer listening at a time, but you could use a distributed lock for who is the ""active"" listener - but those are somewhat complicated."
301,2017-07-20T00:09:33.667978,Beula,consul has a mechanism to do this
301,2017-07-20T00:11:45.689274,Marcie,i'd just keep all the state in a database
301,2017-07-20T00:12:34.697335,Marcie,messaging queues and consul in this would make things overly complicated in what's basically a feed consumption mechanism
301,2017-07-20T00:13:19.704726,Katheryn,"&gt; `i'd just keep all the state in a database`
Could you please elaborate more on this?"
301,2017-07-20T00:21:03.780890,Marcie,"<@Katheryn> you have two services:
  service a: talks to Slack RTM, receives messages and puts them in incoming database, reads outgoing database, sends event to slack
  service b: consumes messages from incoming database, does logic to generate response, puts outgoing message onto database"
301,2017-07-20T00:22:51.798452,Beula,"That doesn't really solve the issue of service a going down though, which is the desire, from my understanding"

301,2017-07-20T00:23:23.803873,Marcie,service b can run as many instances as you'd like
301,2017-07-20T00:24:21.813358,Marcie,and you could run multiple service a as well if you wanted
301,2017-07-20T00:24:40.816405,Marcie,you'd just have a constraint on message ID uniqueness in the DB
301,2017-07-20T00:25:23.823681,Katheryn,"so, basically, we are using database as an alternative to a message queue here?"
301,2017-07-20T00:26:02.830032,Beula,<@Katheryn> the difference with a DB is the unique constraint if you get message IDs
301,2017-07-20T00:26:11.831598,Beula,so you could have any number of consumers from the RTM api
301,2017-07-20T00:26:19.833157,Marcie,alternative isn't quite the right phrase i think
301,2017-07-20T00:26:25.834128,Katheryn,I see
301,2017-07-20T00:26:52.838580,Beula,"But depending on your load, you may get some DB locking issues. With 800 users, you are probably OK"
301,2017-07-20T00:27:13.841953,Beula,even our chat at its busiest wouldn't cause any trouble (that I can think of)
301,2017-07-20T00:27:20.843290,Marcie,message queues are really good for service discovery but not as good for reliable storage
301,2017-07-20T00:28:52.857968,Beula,"If you wanted the distributed systems approach for load:

1. N consumers -&gt; Rabbitmq Excahnge
2. RabbitMQ Exchange to any bound queues
  *  One queue subscribed for saving to a DB
  * Another for processing

You can do different routing mechanisms so the same work goes to the same worker, but instead just allow dupes and test for dupes on the consumer side"
301,2017-07-20T00:29:07.860362,Beula,"But that's way overly complicated for the current need, it sounds"
301,2017-07-20T00:32:33.894629,Katheryn,"Yes, I would agree. I am more inclined towards <@Marcie> suggestion.
One more question, I am using `crontab` as a kind of “automated restart” setup for my bot’s running service and other scheduled events. Few days ago, there was a problem with `crontab`. Not sure about the cause. Any suggestions on improving this setup? Alternatives to `crontab`?"
301,2017-07-20T00:33:31.904996,Katheryn,Can we have notifications setup to know if `cron` didn’t run?
301,2017-07-20T00:33:53.908366,Beula,Are you polling for it to be up or something?
301,2017-07-20T00:34:01.909778,Beula,"A `systemd` service would be better, IMO"
301,2017-07-20T00:35:33.924905,Katheryn,"Well, I’m using `cron` to poll and monitor for my bot’s running process. So, to poll cron, we need another monitor?"
301,2017-07-20T00:35:47.927229,Beula,"No, systemd would replace that need"
301,2017-07-20T00:36:03.929826,Collette,RabbitMQ with HA queues and publisher confirms is a pretty good reliable storage for temporary data
301,2017-07-20T00:36:04.930032,Beula,"basically the OS has a construct to ensure a process is always running at a certain ""runlevel"""
301,2017-07-20T00:36:22.932813,Beula,Look into `systemctl` or `systemd` <@Katheryn>
301,2017-07-20T00:36:28.933784,Beula,they should be synonymous
301,2017-07-20T00:37:09.940185,Katheryn,"Thank you <@Beula> , you are a great help. Will read on those

302,2017-07-20T03:52:49.517566,Suellen,not sure how to pass an argument to `db.Float` when constructing a Column with ORM
302,2017-07-20T03:52:58.520319,Suellen,but you can achieve the same with:

303,2017-07-20T05:49:30.124075,Gabriele,"It doesn't matter, although you want to be accessing a separate _database_ on it (i.e. `CREATE DATABASE testing`)"

303,2017-07-20T05:52:52.199066,Meg,and not doing so is a major red flag

303,2017-07-20T05:53:19.209075,Thomasina,"<@Meg> So, as in having a separate database locally, on the staging dyno, and on the production dyno? (Already have the latter two)"
303,2017-07-20T05:53:24.210903,Meg,correct

303,2017-07-20T05:54:19.231219,Meg,"if you have a local db, that's one less network resource you need to worry about"
303,2017-07-20T05:54:46.241103,Thomasina,That's a good point. Actually I sometimes work places without any internet.
303,2017-07-20T05:54:59.246097,Thomasina,Guess that's been decided then. Thanks :smile:
303,2017-07-20T05:55:06.248747,Meg,so you can keep a small portion of the prod db on your local machine

304,2017-07-20T07:31:30.078840,Thomasina,Anyone here familiar with PostGIS?
304,2017-07-20T07:33:57.122717,Gabriele,I've done a bit with it.
304,2017-07-20T07:37:00.177605,Thomasina,<@Gabriele> Cool! Do you know where I might be able to get my hands on some sample geography data to experiment with? I have a database but it's full of shape and geometry data and I want to try querying for all objects within a certain radius of a point which I can't do without geography data.
304,2017-07-20T07:39:44.227012,Meg,you should be able to convert from geometry to geography

304,2017-07-20T07:40:55.248623,Gabriele,"<@Thomasina>  I personally just used data from sources like Google Maps, querying for places and their long/lat, and adding to my DB"
304,2017-07-20T07:42:12.271846,Thomasina,"<@Gabriele> Through the Google Maps API? Or do they have downloadable datasets?
<@Meg> Thanks! I'll look into that. Also, Docker does sound really useful. I'm going to check them out! Thanks! :smile:"
304,2017-07-20T07:42:24.275528,Gabriele,through the API

304,2017-07-20T07:42:37.279183,Meg,"if you already have the data, no need to use google maps"
304,2017-07-20T07:43:15.290456,Meg,and the US Census bureau already has plenty of data for download

304,2017-07-20T07:43:34.296243,Gabriele,"Yeah, I wasn't suggesting he use Google Maps, just saying that my application did"
304,2017-07-20T07:43:42.298367,Meg,ah ok
304,2017-07-20T07:49:19.400704,Thomasina,"<@Gabriele> Oh, sorry I suppose I actually misunderstood my problem. I'm running this query:
`SELECT * FROM towns WHERE ST_Distance_Sphere(geom, ST_MakePoint(71.3033,44.2706)) &lt;= 150 * 1609.34`
and the error is:
```ERROR:  BOOM! Could not generate outside point!
CONTEXT:  SQL function ""st_distance_sphere"" statement 2```
By `statement 2` I think it's actually referring to `ST_MakePoint(71.3033,44.2706)`. This is a valid lat/long though and looking at the documentation it appears `ST_MakePoint` does in fact accept a lat/long. :thinking_face:"

304,2017-07-20T07:51:29.441934,Thomasina,"Oh, well since I don't have to look for it I might use the Canadian information then. :joy: Thanks"

304,2017-07-20T07:53:21.476776,Meg,and regarding your query
304,2017-07-20T07:53:27.478768,Meg,what is `geom`
304,2017-07-20T07:53:56.487739,Gabriele,To get all locations within a radius of somewhere is exactly the right sort of problem for PostGIS
304,2017-07-20T07:54:02.489495,Meg,yeah
304,2017-07-20T07:54:09.491617,Meg,because you're working with spatial data
304,2017-07-20T07:54:13.492812,Gabriele,The only simpler solution is to call someone else's API to perform the same operation on their database
304,2017-07-20T07:54:21.495510,Meg,and postgis is highly optimized
304,2017-07-20T07:54:27.497078,Meg,you could do a naive solution
304,2017-07-20T07:54:35.500256,Meg,but it would be significantly less performant
304,2017-07-20T07:54:40.501642,Thomasina,`geom` is a column containing geometry data (in this case it's the boundaries of towns in a small section of the US).
304,2017-07-20T07:54:55.506551,Meg,<https://postgis.net/docs/ST_DistanceSphere.html>
304,2017-07-20T07:55:08.510442,Gabriele,"It needs points, not just any arbitrary geometry"
304,2017-07-20T07:55:17.513378,Thomasina,Well I better stick with PostGIS then. While load will be very light at first it could become quite heavy later on.

304,2017-07-20T07:58:01.566681,Thomasina,"<@Gabriele> Oh yeah, my bad. I guess what I want to do then (to keep things simple) is to work out the center-point of each shape first."
304,2017-07-20T07:58:10.569479,Gabriele,"I think there are other functions that are more lenient on which types they accept for distance calculations, but the docs for that one suggest that it doesn't"

304,2017-07-20T10:05:46.205710,Beula,The if/main thing simply means: if executing this script directly run this code. It allows you to have a module that is runnable or importable (that code won't run on import)
304,2017-07-20T10:06:03.216304,Thomasina,"<@Gabriele> So I took a very large dataset of world cities in .csv and imported them into my database, then I added a `geog` column and used `UPDATE cities SET geog = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude), 4326);` which ran without errors.

304,2017-07-20T10:07:33.272836,Beula,<@Thomasina> :taco: 
304,2017-07-20T10:07:42.278264,Thomasina,vs. running `python myotherscript.py` - on a script containing `import myscript`
304,2017-07-20T10:07:52.284461,Thomasina,<@Beula> :fork_and_knife:
304,2017-07-20T10:08:52.321340,Gabriele,Although it looks like you're assigning geometry to a geography column... not sure if that's okay or not
304,2017-07-20T10:08:57.324500,Thomasina,"There aren't all that many times when I have enough knowledge to help around here, so I try to do it when I can."
304,2017-07-20T10:09:46.354737,Thomasina,"Maybe I should have ran `ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude)::geography`?"
304,2017-07-20T10:10:42.389366,Winnifred,Nice!
304,2017-07-20T10:11:12.407518,Gabriele,ST_SetSRID returns geometry
304,2017-07-20T10:13:23.488094,Thomasina,Oh does it? I used the command because I think it was in a solution on StackOverflow...now I can't seem to find the page so maybe I just got mixed up. :joy:
304,2017-07-20T10:13:51.505696,Gabriele,Those commands look fine - but if you try to assign a geometry to a geography column I don't know what will happen
304,2017-07-20T10:14:46.539421,Thomasina,"I see... Well, I'm having a lot of difficulty finding a way of populating a geography column from lat/long coordinates :confused:"
304,2017-07-20T10:16:59.623296,Gabriele,you probably just want a geometry column
304,2017-07-20T10:17:02.625065,Thomasina,"Ok so I found the StackOverflow post. I see that it was recommended to run `ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(long, lat), 4326)::geography`. I omitted casting completely."
304,2017-07-20T10:17:27.640409,Thomasina,After reading it doesn't sound like geometry would be a good fit as my use case involves locations on a global scale
304,2017-07-20T10:17:51.655682,Thomasina,Unless I misunderstand the pros/cons which is certainly possible
304,2017-07-20T10:18:51.693768,Gabriele,Usually it'll depend on what sort of distances are involved
304,2017-07-20T10:21:51.806482,Kandis,i am still trying to figure it out lol
304,2017-07-20T10:26:38.991225,Kandis,The if/main thing simply means: if executing this script directly run this code. It allows you to have a module that is runnable or importable (that code won’t run on import)
304,2017-07-20T10:26:56.003296,Kandis,this script here means this chuck of code?
304,2017-07-20T10:27:15.015085,Kandis,chunk*
304,2017-07-20T10:27:35.028087,Kandis,"this code means:
import pandas as pd
def test_run():
    df=pd.read_csv(‘/Users/elaineyang/Desktop/Programming/AAPL.csv’)
    print(df)"
304,2017-07-20T10:27:36.028818,Kandis,?
304,2017-07-20T10:28:22.058726,Kandis,"and can i say, whenever i import something i have to have “if __name__==‘__main__‘:”"
304,2017-07-20T10:28:37.069169,Kandis,or else the imported code cant be run?
304,2017-07-20T10:28:47.075388,Kandis,<@Thomasina>
304,2017-07-20T10:30:10.129885,Beula,"So for example, I have this script:

```
# cat.py
class Cat:
    def say(self):
        print(""meow"")


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    Cat().say()
```

I can either call it directly: `python cat.py` and it will meow.

But say I have another module that wants to use this class:

```
from cat import Cat

class ChesireCat(Cat):
    def dress_up(self):
        pass
```

I wouldn't want it to meow until I tell it to
"
304,2017-07-20T10:30:22.138388,Thomasina,"<@Kandis>
So everything...oh wait he beat me to it :joy:"
304,2017-07-20T10:31:02.164511,Thomasina,<@Beula> :lightning: :runner:
304,2017-07-20T10:31:14.172514,Kandis,lol
304,2017-07-20T10:31:35.186880,Beula,"The background on this is that `__name__` is a build in dunder (double underscore). It is set to the name of the module running - if the module is executed directly it's ""__main__"", otherwise I think it defaults to the file name (I don't recall ATM)"
304,2017-07-20T10:32:46.234228,Beula,Tldr you only need the if name/main if you want to be able to execute some code when the script is directly invoked
304,2017-07-20T10:33:22.258095,Kandis,"so accordin to what you said, how do you let it say meow on the second code"
304,2017-07-20T10:34:03.284780,Kandis,"from cat import Cat

class ChesireCat(Cat):
    def dress_up(self):
        pass"
304,2017-07-20T10:36:13.370100,Beula,"That class inherited the meow method, so make an instance and call say on it!

Sorry, a class may have been a bad example"
304,2017-07-20T10:42:10.602973,Kandis,<@Beula> <@Thomasina> <@Winnifred> :taco: thanks so much!
304,2017-07-20T10:42:52.630326,Thomasina,<@Kandis> :knife_fork_plate: Thanks! I was actually pretty hungry.
304,2017-07-20T10:43:50.669236,Kandis,haha you havent had breakfast
304,2017-07-20T10:44:12.683357,Kandis,we share the same time zone!
304,2017-07-20T10:44:35.698699,Kandis,oh you meant my taco
304,2017-07-20T10:44:37.699846,Kandis,lmfao
304,2017-07-20T10:45:03.717338,Thomasina,"Oh, cool! Didn't notice the time zone. Actually I had a small breakfast but I woke up at 1AM, so I haven't eaten in 8 or 9 hours. :dizzy_face:"
304,2017-07-20T10:45:50.748483,Kandis,:fearful: hope your bed time is not usually like this lol it doesnt sound good
304,2017-07-20T10:47:38.819959,Thomasina,"Haha, I don't really have a bedtime. Sometimes I'm going to sleep at 10PM, other times 6AM, other times 2PM. It seems to change every day too. I can't hold a schedule. Today maybe I'll sleep around...I'm not even sure...8PM? I was a night owl but now I'm a cuckoo bird it seems. :joy:"
304,2017-07-20T10:50:28.933554,Thomasina,"<@Kandis> By the way, if you don't mind me asking, I'm just really curious; are you learning Python for school?"
304,2017-07-20T10:51:18.967535,Kandis,haha! i learn it for my career :joy: i wanna be able to build a trading program and things like that
304,2017-07-20T10:51:31.976182,Kandis,i am studying finance at school
304,2017-07-20T10:52:44.024884,Kandis,"python is kinda cool. i was thinking of learning SQL or R after it, but woah, python seems deep enough for me to learn quite a while <@Thomasina>"
304,2017-07-20T10:54:42.103732,Thomasina,"<@Kandis> Oh, niiiice! That's really cool. Yes, I'm not sure whether R would be all that helpful if you learn Python, although learning at least basic SQL could come in handy sometimes. I suppose you'll be doing a lot of data science in your field? Perhaps machine learning?"
304,2017-07-20T10:55:56.153257,Thomasina,I've been doing web and software dev for a long time but started learning Python more recently as it was required for a project involving machine learning.
304,2017-07-20T10:56:04.159260,Kandis,"see. i found something online, here:"
304,2017-07-20T10:56:06.160159,Kandis,"Banks use Python for pricing, risk management and trade management platforms. More recently, they’ve been reprogramming their trading systems to run off Python rather than other, clunkier languages."
304,2017-07-20T10:56:08.162048,Beula,I was a finance person <@Kandis> - started with python too :smile:
304,2017-07-20T10:57:12.205666,Thomasina,"<@Beula> Oh that's right! Then did you work with pandas, numpy, scikit or similar tech?"
304,2017-07-20T10:57:36.221945,Thomasina,I'm not sure how long ML has played a big role in finances but would be interested in knowing.
304,2017-07-20T10:58:33.260175,Kandis,<@Beula> so cool. was python helpful to you during work?
304,2017-07-20T10:58:34.261269,Beula,"No, I was more in the retail side (to clients directly, vs in a bank) and at the time I didn't know how much was out there!"
304,2017-07-20T10:59:03.280943,Beula,"Yeah <@Kandis> , I wasn't doing a ton of high intensity stuff with it - but I was able to remove about 10-12hours of work/week by automating silly tasks"
304,2017-07-20T10:59:14.287294,Kandis,so cooooooool
304,2017-07-20T10:59:20.291377,Kandis,were you in a retail bank you said?
304,2017-07-20T10:59:33.300552,Kandis,what kind of bank
304,2017-07-20T11:00:47.351564,Kandis,<@Beula>
304,2017-07-20T11:01:31.383008,Beula,"No, the retail side (not a bank). I was a financial advisor"
304,2017-07-20T11:01:36.386505,Beula,and stock trader for clients
304,2017-07-20T11:05:07.530230,Thomasina,"<@Kandis> I believe there's a ton of opportunity in this space, and it also allows you to branch in different directions should the economy change. Not only a lot of jobs but a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities as well. It's a smart choice."
304,2017-07-20T11:05:36.550271,Kandis,<@Beula> SO COOL what do you do now then
304,2017-07-20T11:05:49.558671,Kandis,<@Thomasina> :+1::skin-tone-3:
304,2017-07-20T11:30:39.548937,Beula,That's a good idea! Do you ever use doctest too? It's excellent for simple functions <https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html>
304,2017-07-20T11:59:32.693269,Kandis,plt.grid(True)
304,2017-07-20T11:59:37.696431,Kandis,what does this mean
304,2017-07-20T12:03:11.838040,Helene,I want to learn python . What is the best resource to refer for object oriented python ?
304,2017-07-20T12:04:13.878101,Thomasina,<@Kandis> I'm not entirely sure what library `plt` is referring to but if I'm correct I think it simply enables the display on a grid in any charts you generate.
304,2017-07-20T12:04:33.891183,Thomasina,"Oh ya, probably pltlib"
304,2017-07-20T12:04:40.895808,Beula,"<@Helene> Do you know any other programming languages, or are you just starting out?"
304,2017-07-20T12:06:31.965070,Meg,"<@Kandis> might mean the matplotlib library, since `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` is common convention"
304,2017-07-20T12:07:09.988557,Meg,"and for future reference, when you ask these kind of questions (what does this variable do, etc), its best to add some more information"
304,2017-07-20T12:07:34.003696,Meg,"and in this case, if you had the code in front of you, you could search for instances of `plt` in the code"
304,2017-07-20T12:07:46.011169,Meg,"which would have brought you to the import statement, among others"
304,2017-07-20T12:08:16.029732,Kandis,yea i just didnt know the grid(True) part and kai_m answered me ;D
304,2017-07-20T12:08:26.035169,Helene,yup . I know basic programming .
304,2017-07-20T12:08:31.038331,Meg,understood
304,2017-07-20T12:08:48.048837,Helene,but my concepts of object oriented programming are not so cool .
305,2017-07-20T07:40:33.242022,Meg,"and furthermore, regarding docker

so, docker basically puts a bare bones VM in which you specify containers for parts of your application stack."
305,2017-07-20T07:40:47.246412,Meg,"so, if you're on windows and another dev is on mac"
305,2017-07-20T07:41:01.250420,Meg,you can ensure that whatever issues you have are code related and not OS related
305,2017-07-20T07:41:36.261085,Meg,"furthermore, bringing in a new dev and getting them integrated with the projects is much simpler, because you already hhave the environment and code _right there_"
306,2017-07-20T09:56:37.852226,Thomasina,"So I've loaded a table with a list of world cities but I'm not getting the expected results. For example I can run `SELECT * FROM cities WHERE ST_DWithin(geog, ST_MakePoint(45.4215,75.6972)::geography, 470000)` which _should_ return Toronto and a number of other surrounding cities. I've confirmed that Toronto exists in the database with the expected lat/long. However 0 rows are returned. :disappointed:"
306,2017-07-20T10:00:29.002518,Gabriele,<@Thomasina> Do you ever get any results? e.g. if you increase the distance to a very large number?
306,2017-07-20T10:03:48.130706,Gabriele,"<@Thomasina> _""the source geometries must both be of the same coordinate projection""_... are you sure the data is all correct?"
307,2017-07-20T11:24:21.296200,Meghan,"I sometimes use this for simple unittests. The module is meant to be imported, but I have a few things I want to test that can be tested individually, so throw it under an if name main at the bottom and test away.

I wouldn't suggest this for a larger project though, but for something simple or just to test in development it works."
308,2017-07-20T12:28:48.763606,Helene,can you suggest some good resources ?
308,2017-07-20T12:31:51.873261,Beula,Hoping others come along that are newer than I am with their resources they used :smile:
308,2017-07-20T12:45:49.360914,Helene,and can you share some advanced resources you use ?
308,2017-07-20T12:45:58.366579,Helene,May be something may help
308,2017-07-20T12:54:40.666871,Beula,"You can go through the python tutorial, otherwise I just look at stuff as they come up. <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>

Later when you know Python better, Effective Python is a good book - but again, after you know the language and can appreciate the tips"
308,2017-07-20T17:21:06.792078,Hyman,Has any one here ever tried to implement a SDN using python ?
309,2017-07-20T15:16:08.607561,Thomasina,Exactly how much water should be in the paddy for my summer crop of rice? I need agricultural advice.
309,2017-07-20T15:28:16.985827,Levi,and getting stackoverflow working for you is also a skill that should be honed.

I have a time in a string format as 
`2017-07-21T02:16:51.449-07:00`

I am seeking this to convert it into unix-timestamp.
Anybody have any idea ?"

$ pip install arrow
... then, in Python ...
t = arrow.get('2017-07-21T02:16:51.449-07:00')

311,2017-07-21T05:24:26.820668,Gabriele,"If that doesn't work, you can use `arrow.get` with a specific format string"
311,2017-07-21T05:24:39.825307,Gabriele,I recommend `arrow` over standard library functionality.
311,2017-07-21T07:24:34.047863,Florene,"<@Gabriele> : Thanks for response!
that worked :slightly_smiling_face:
i hope there's no problem in using that..."
311,2017-07-21T07:24:51.052547,Meg,shouldn't be
311,2017-07-21T07:25:04.056155,Meg,since its intended to be as close as a drop in replacement
311,2017-07-21T07:25:22.060679,Florene,"Also it does consider 
`07:00`
from the time, right ? which i think is the timezone, right ?"
311,2017-07-21T07:25:33.063742,Gabriele,"specifically it's -7:00, and yes"
311,2017-07-21T07:25:40.065736,Meg,"so, java had a really crappy time/calendar library in the standard library for years before it pulled in `joda-time` into the core API"
311,2017-07-21T07:25:49.067819,Meg,"now, if only python could do something similar..."
311,2017-07-21T07:26:34.080297,Gabriele,"I think the success of pypi has meant that standard library development has stagnated somewhat, which is a shame"
311,2017-07-21T07:28:53.117323,Gabriele,"we have a poor selection of date/time libraries, and nothing much of use for multimedia generally. But hey, we have `dbm` for ""databases"", `nntplib` for all the newsgroups we need to access regularly, and `sunau` for reading ancient audio files, so it's not all bad"
311,2017-07-21T07:32:14.173790,Suellen,is this sarcasm? :disappointed:
311,2017-07-21T07:32:23.176477,Gabriele,just a little
311,2017-07-21T07:32:31.178481,Suellen,sqlite and shelve / dbm modules aren't bad
311,2017-07-21T07:32:35.179679,Suellen,they are very much OK
311,2017-07-21T07:32:39.180965,Gabriele,sqlite is great
311,2017-07-21T07:33:26.193166,Gabriele,But I do think Python would be better if there was more effort spent on getting good packages into the standard library
311,2017-07-21T07:33:41.196982,Suellen,yeah.. maybe.. but it's not that easy
311,2017-07-21T07:33:51.199637,Suellen,say you want a better datetime. what do you pick?
311,2017-07-21T07:33:59.201581,Suellen,Arrow? Why not Delorean?
311,2017-07-21T07:34:32.211009,Gabriele,"That's not the sort of thing you need to answer immediately in a chat... you'd get a few knowledgeable people, they'd discuss it for a bit, find use cases, check code quality, etc"
311,2017-07-21T07:34:37.212464,Suellen,"There's going to be a huge debase, because it's not like it's clear which of the two is massively better."
311,2017-07-21T07:35:06.220121,Gabriele,"Doesn't matter. This happens already for other PEPs. There's a discussion, then a decision is made"
311,2017-07-21T07:36:15.238709,Suellen,"But PyPI provides an illusion of a democracy, where you can chose whatever you want."
311,2017-07-21T07:36:33.243676,Suellen,Python and PEPs isn't a democracy at all
311,2017-07-21T07:36:57.250101,Suellen,so maybe it's a calculated decision -- to not introduce some things into stdlib
311,2017-07-21T07:37:01.251272,Gabriele,PyPI wouldn't go away. Users are always free to reinvent the wheel
311,2017-07-21T07:37:09.253314,Gabriele,"And yeah, it probably is a calculated decision; one I disagree with"
311,2017-07-21T07:37:36.260151,Gabriele,"If you're gonna say that batteries are included, they should be good batteries, ones suitable for powering modern software"
311,2017-07-21T07:56:43.574336,Gabriele,Maybe it's not relevant to anything else in the program
311,2017-07-21T07:56:51.576671,Gabriele,Generally speaking I avoid it if possible
311,2017-07-21T07:58:32.605714,Meg,"it you're trying to limit the number of imports, I can understand"
312,2017-07-21T07:56:09.564426,Mariano,Reasons for importing something inside of a function?. Besides avoiding circular imports
312,2017-07-21T07:57:44.591684,Mariano,I have just done it for avoiding circular imports on some celery tasks. But i have seem it on open source projects
312,2017-07-21T07:58:39.608021,Meg,especially highly specific imports
312,2017-07-21T07:58:49.611105,Patty,It also violates PEP8
312,2017-07-21T07:58:50.611231,Meg,but isn't there a bit of a penalty in doing so?
312,2017-07-21T07:58:58.613864,Meg,"performance penalty, that is"
312,2017-07-21T07:59:07.616321,Meg,because that method gets hit
312,2017-07-21T07:59:15.618808,Meg,has to import a dependency before continuing execution
312,2017-07-21T07:59:19.619948,Mariano,I read that imports are expensives
312,2017-07-21T07:59:38.625625,Gabriele,they can be
312,2017-07-21T08:00:49.649741,Patty,"and some people leave the more expensive ones in functions that arent often called, thats a main reason i see it too"

312,2017-07-21T08:06:29.756314,Kandis,what about t**2?? <@Luana>

313,2017-07-21T08:08:25.791908,Samuel,but t is an array?
314,2017-07-21T08:27:44.162361,Suellen,the function applies to every element of the original array
314,2017-07-21T08:28:19.174283,Suellen,"so you see three plots: `y = x^1`, `y = x^2` and `y = x^3`"
314,2017-07-21T10:04:21.814254,Gabriele,"I know you can use a `with` block in some other test packages, but to be honest this seems like a weird thing to be testing for"

that an object throws an AttributeError exception when a nonexistent

It works fine, but I had to put the attribute access in a function.
I'd rather not define that function and use the assertRaises as follows:

  self.assertRaises(AttributeError, lambda item: item.donation)

Is this somehow possible without helper function?

315,2017-07-21T10:06:22.885754,Gabriele,"You could probably use `self.assertIn(""donation"", item.__dict__)` or some similar abomination if you really want a one-liner"
315,2017-07-21T10:14:24.161608,Ruben,"<@Gabriele> Yeah it sounds weird, but actually the object under test is some kind of container giving both attribute and keyed lookup access to a set of properties, and I need to test whether the right exceptions are thrown during lookup of a nonexistent property."
315,2017-07-21T10:16:49.245549,Gabriele,"Sounds like a bad idea to me. But if I had to write tests for it, I'd just use the __dict__ check directly. Or `hasattr`."
315,2017-07-21T10:20:30.373050,Ruben,"<@Gabriele> Bad idea? You have a better idea? Thanks for the `hasattr` tip! This is what it's all about, the `Bunch` object: <https://github.com/motoom/bunch>"
315,2017-07-21T10:21:21.402618,Gabriele,"I think that is unnecessarily blurring the lines between a container and a type. If you don't know what attributes a type has, then you don't really know what interface it provides, which makes it a very awkward object to work with"
315,2017-07-21T10:23:03.461371,Ruben,"<@Gabriele> I use it declutter my source code. Basically it is a `dict` like object where you don't have to type `[""` and `""]` all the time. So I can write:```"
315,2017-07-21T10:24:36.514624,Ruben,"```for r in bunched(recordset): # Where recordset is fetch_all() of DictCursor
   if r.salary &lt; 3000:
      print r.name, ""could use a raise""
```"
315,2017-07-21T10:25:11.534439,Ruben,"Psycopg2 has a `NamedTupleCursor`, which provides the same syntax."
315,2017-07-21T10:26:04.565260,Gabriele,"In that case, at least the schema is documented elsewhere. But I don't like it."
315,2017-07-21T10:27:03.600478,Ruben,"The alternative would be:
```
for r in recordset:
   if r[""salary""] &lt; 3000:
        print r[""name""], ""could use a raise""
```
You prefer that?"
315,2017-07-21T10:27:49.627957,Gabriele,Maybe
315,2017-07-21T10:28:08.639557,Ruben,I can work like that. You have a job for me? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
315,2017-07-21T10:28:32.653471,Gabriele,"In the general case, yes. It's not exactly a great hardship. In a database context, it might be nice to have a type that directly reflects the DB schema - which is what we have ORM for"
315,2017-07-21T10:29:33.689487,Ruben,"btw, the `NamedTupleCursor` gets its attribute names from the fields behind the *SELECT*. I.e. `select name, salary from Employees` would result in *.name* and *.salary* attributes on the tuples in the resultset."
315,2017-07-21T10:30:25.720812,Gabriele,"I just really dislike things that attempt to cut down on a bit of typing by ruining the interface. Several parsers do it, like BeautifulSoup. lxml.objectify is even worse"
315,2017-07-21T10:31:34.762088,Ruben,I wouldn't call it ruining. It makes the code more readable to me. I prefer dot notation over index lookup with a string.
315,2017-07-21T10:33:07.816673,Gabriele,"The dot notation and the index lookup carry different information. `x.y` implies that `y` _must_ exist. `x[""y""]` implies that a value for ""y"" might exist, if someone added it earlier."
315,2017-07-21T10:33:33.832134,Suellen,"Except xml node is not a container, but an object :confused:"
315,2017-07-21T10:34:42.873174,Ruben,"Ah, we have a different view on that too. When I see `x[""y""]` in code, I assume the programmer knows that an *y* value is present, or should be present (punishable by KeyError). When I see `x.get(y)`, then I know the programmer is trying to communicate to me that *y* perhaps does not exist in *x*."
315,2017-07-21T10:34:57.881984,Gabriele,it's an object that contains an arbitrary number of other objects
315,2017-07-21T10:35:31.902663,Gabriele,"<@Ruben>  But the point is that you see it's a dict, and that the contents vary"
315,2017-07-21T10:35:48.912684,Gabriele,"Obviously you can make assumptions if you know what's been added, but the syntax tells you the nature of the structure you're working with"
315,2017-07-21T10:36:19.931514,Ruben,"<@Gabriele> Yeah there you have a point, `x[""y""]` certainly conveys that *x* is a dict."
315,2017-07-21T10:38:10.995829,Ruben,...or at least a mapping type on which you can do indexed lookups.
315,2017-07-21T10:39:40.049683,Ruben,"Now wouldn't it be fun to override `__getitem__()` to call a memberfunction instead of looking up a value, and have `__call__()` lookup an indexed item?"
315,2017-07-21T10:40:11.067809,Ruben,"You could write `a[""save""]` to call functions and `a(""age"")` to lookup values."

316,2017-07-21T11:28:53.828574,Fern,I'm trying to use Pycharm CE with Flask but I can't seem to configure a interpreter to run `virtualenv/Scripts/flask` or `python -m flask run`. Is there anyway to run Flask applications inside Pycharm without having to buy the pro version?
316,2017-07-21T11:36:05.092472,Beula,"<@Fern> I believe you just need to set the interpreter to the virtualenv Python, then in the run panel you use flask as the script"

316,2017-07-21T11:39:38.216346,Fern,How would I reference flask as the script?

316,2017-07-21T11:45:05.405061,Beula,Flask is the script/executable
316,2017-07-21T11:45:22.414891,Fern,in `env\Scripts`?
316,2017-07-21T11:45:30.420236,Beula,`which flask` would show the path on posix

Takes arguments in sets of 3:
&gt; (x-val, y-val, 'color/shape')
Each plots a function.

So `t, t, 'r--'`  corresponds to one line, `t, t**2`, 'bs'` to another, and `t, t**3, 'g^'` to another.

'r--', 'bs' and 'g^' indicate color and shape. example: 'g^' stands for green triangles."
318,2017-07-21T13:55:05.606995,Myong,Best way to approach calling function using a dictionary to store the func object as a value. I'm doing this in a class so it doesn't quite work properly the traditional way of literally just using the function object name as the value.

322,2017-07-22T03:29:23.564989,Reina,why ?
322,2017-07-22T04:00:58.667249,Reina,ok got it
322,2017-07-22T05:29:12.971477,Thomasina,I'm trying to wrap my head around GeoAlchemy but I'm having a really hard time. I have a lat and lon column in my table...should I be using a geometry column instead?
322,2017-07-22T05:29:38.972867,Gabriele,yes
322,2017-07-22T05:30:59.977988,Thomasina,"Ok...but I'm not sure if I should be using geography or geometry...If I wanted to show points over the size of, say, the continental US, would that be a problem with geometry?"
322,2017-07-22T05:31:19.979154,Gabriele,Are you showing points over that sort of area within a single query? And what are your accuracy requirements?
322,2017-07-22T05:32:11.982207,Gabriele,"PostGIS is definitely awkward to work with, I'll give you that. And understanding the geom/geog stuff, and converting between them, is fiddly. But stick at it."
322,2017-07-22T05:33:19.986308,Gabriele,"I have a geography column in my DB (specifically, `geography(Point,4326) NOT NULL`), and it works for me. I only need to find places near other places, and each place is represented with a point, so I don't have rigorous requirements on accuracy, or the need for it to be correct over long distances"
322,2017-07-22T05:33:33.987311,Gabriele,So I could probably have been okay with a geometry object
322,2017-07-22T05:37:28.001376,Thomasina,"The accuracy doesn't have to be particularly high at that distance, just good enough that if the user zooms in on that point on the map it doesn't drift so much that it appears to be flying across the map. Haha
Thank you for your encouragement! I am determined to figure it out. :slightly_smiling_face:
I suppose that the important part is showing points within a much smaller scale (say a few city blocks in each direction) within about 5 meters of accuracy. I'm just thinking though that even if the large scale stuff isn't important, why not use geography anyway?"
322,2017-07-22T05:38:25.004638,Gabriele,"Geography has fewer functions available on it, so you need to convert to geometry to perform various tasks"
322,2017-07-22T05:38:45.005686,Gabriele,"I mostly just compare distances, so geography is fine. The geography type basically exists to allow for accurate distance comparisons"
322,2017-07-22T05:39:31.008228,Gabriele,"But trying to perform complex perimeter or area calculations on the surface of a not-quite-sphere is complex, so for that sort of thing, I think that is where they require you to project to geometry and suck up some error"
322,2017-07-22T05:51:29.050327,Thomasina,"Ah I see. Makes sense. The only thing that's important is that I'm able to get everything within a box (which will be the area the user is viewing in the app). Distance between points, perimeters, and areas, aren't important"
322,2017-07-22T05:57:42.072149,Gabriele,"Sounds like you want the ST_Contains test. It operates on geometry. Make a polygon of your box, test it against the points."
322,2017-07-22T05:58:58.076585,Gabriele,"There's also ST_Covers for geography, but it appears less used."
323,2017-07-22T03:52:17.637778,Suellen,`map` returns an iterator (lazily)
323,2017-07-22T03:53:07.640313,Suellen,"i.e. if you have a million objects and apply a function with `map`, the `map object` will be returned right away and the actual result of a function will be applied when you iterate over the values"
323,2017-07-22T03:54:04.643157,Suellen,"`my_list3 = list(map(lambda n: n*n, nums))` is one way to ""fix"" this"

324,2017-07-22T06:49:23.255447,Thomasina,<@Meg> Thanks! This looks like it would be very helpful for me. If I need to do much more PostGIS stuff after this I think I should strongly consider buying it
324,2017-07-22T06:49:53.257193,Thomasina,"<@Gabriele> Oh ok, I'll take a look at ST_Contains"
324,2017-07-22T06:50:01.257668,Meg,"well, considering your project is very reliant on GIS, I would get it regardless"
324,2017-07-22T06:54:57.274811,Thomasina,"Well, I would but I'm super duper tight on money at the moment so unfortunately I need to try to hold off for the time being. I'll definitely take a look when I have a bit more money to spend though :slightly_smiling_face:"

324,2017-07-22T07:22:08.368755,Thomasina,My Alembic or more specifically SqlAlchemy-Migrate keeps trying to drop the spatial_ref_sys table required by PostGIS. Is there a way to make it ignore it?
324,2017-07-22T07:24:20.375844,Suellen,<@Thomasina> <http://dev.utek.pl/2013/ignoring-tables-in-alembic/>
324,2017-07-22T07:24:34.376602,Suellen,&gt; While working on spatial enabled application I came up to a problem with spatial table in my postgres database (spatial_ref_sys). Alembic insisted on deleting this table as it wasn't declared in my models.py.
324,2017-07-22T07:24:55.377749,Suellen,I think it's your situation described
324,2017-07-22T07:27:40.387065,Thomasina,"<@Suellen> Yep, exactly. :smile: Thanks!"
324,2017-07-22T07:27:46.387336,Suellen,:slightly_smiling_face:
324,2017-07-22T07:29:52.394177,Thomasina,One thing that confuses me a bit is that his `run_migrations_online` function is _completely_ different from mine. :thinking_face:
324,2017-07-22T07:30:18.395843,Thomasina,It makes me wonder if this is built on an older version of the function and if replacing mine with this could lead to problems
324,2017-07-22T07:31:32.400014,Suellen,You can probably adapt it somehow
324,2017-07-22T07:32:30.403039,Suellen,"BTW, Alemic docs states that migrations should not be committed without human inspection first, so a really simple solution is to manually remove the ""drop table"" bits"
324,2017-07-22T07:32:48.404100,Suellen,"Not really a beautiful solution, but still"
324,2017-07-22T07:55:20.484421,Thomasina,<@Suellen> Oddly removing the `drop`s manually fixes the error _but_ none of the model tables were created in the database... :facepalm:
324,2017-07-22T07:58:11.494702,Suellen,:open_mouth:
324,2017-07-22T08:00:25.504078,Thomasina,"So just dropped the alembic table, deleted the migrations folder and did the whole process over but still no tables? Not sure what I'm doing wrong."
324,2017-07-22T08:00:58.506515,Thomasina,Then again the migration script has nothing in it for creating the relevant tables. :thinking_face:
324,2017-07-22T08:01:16.507782,Thomasina,Only code for dropping the PostGIS table which I removed
324,2017-07-22T08:01:32.508852,Suellen,it means that it can't detect your models for whatever reason :confused:
324,2017-07-22T08:02:28.512688,Thomasina,"Oh! Yes, I just changed my models from subclassing `Model` to subclassing `Base` from `declarative_base`. Guess that's why."
324,2017-07-22T08:03:41.517433,Thomasina,I'm not sure if that was a good idea but I couldn't help but notice that subclassing `Model` wasn't something done much outside of tutorials.
324,2017-07-22T08:05:52.525964,Suellen,:cry:
324,2017-07-22T08:06:05.526810,Thomasina,:upside_down_face: :question:
324,2017-07-22T08:07:09.531216,Suellen,This is from a real-life product
324,2017-07-22T08:07:50.533795,Gabriele,"Isn't it necessary to derive from Model if you use flask-sqlalchemy, and Base if you just use bare sqlalchemy? There is a difference, as I found out"
324,2017-07-22T08:08:07.534880,Thomasina,Why with most SQLAlchemy extensions do they show a couple examples - usually ORM and core - and neither one of them look like this?
324,2017-07-22T08:08:20.535747,Thomasina,<@Gabriele> Good to know. :sweat_smile:
324,2017-07-22T08:09:02.538139,Thomasina,"I may be but a novice Python dev, but someday I aspire to be a mediocre intermediate dev!"
324,2017-07-22T08:09:16.539063,Suellen,You most definitely will be
324,2017-07-22T08:10:10.542503,Suellen,"&gt; and neither one of them look like this?
Eh, I asked myself the same question. Turns out, writing a tutorial based on real-world applications isn't fun for anyone"
324,2017-07-22T08:10:23.543377,Suellen,Novices will 100% be confused
324,2017-07-22T08:10:54.545166,Suellen,"it's way easier to show the first 2-3 steps with Core or ORM, and move on to the first steps in anything else :slightly_smiling_face:"
324,2017-07-22T08:11:28.547529,Thomasina,To be completely honest I found machine-learning less confusing :smile:
324,2017-07-22T08:13:00.553646,Thomasina,I have a sort of love-hate relationship with it
324,2017-07-22T08:13:34.555869,Suellen,you must be good with maths
324,2017-07-22T08:14:57.560999,Thomasina,"Not that great, but I do enjoy learning math. Honestly read about calculus and all sorts of things for fun. I wasn't really crazy about math as a kid so I'm not sure why that changed."
324,2017-07-22T08:17:11.569711,Thomasina,I was doing the Stanford ML course from Coursera but had to stop at one point once things became a bit too complex. I still intend to go back to it after studying more though.
325,2017-07-22T09:52:59.967544,Fern,What is an pythonic way to specify class dependencies?

I think there is a better name for this parameter"
325,2017-07-22T10:10:41.057002,Fern,Or would you just use the `json` module without specifying it as a dep in the constructor?
325,2017-07-22T10:10:53.058024,Suellen,"yes, this!"
325,2017-07-22T10:11:13.059842,Fern,why? just interested :slightly_smiling_face:
325,2017-07-22T10:12:27.065908,Fern,because it is a built-in?
325,2017-07-22T10:12:39.066906,Suellen,"`to_json` only makes sense with json, and json is always available"

325,2017-07-22T10:19:39.101348,Suellen,`self.name` sets an attribute for every new instance already
325,2017-07-22T10:20:23.104972,Fern,I know but I think it it's more explicit
325,2017-07-22T10:21:36.111198,Fern,What would I use if I would to serialize SQLAlchemy model result?
325,2017-07-22T10:22:24.115363,Fern,would like to be able to encode the results as JSON or cast it to a dict
325,2017-07-22T10:24:36.126546,Fern,Is `marshmallow` any good or is there anyway to it with pure python easily? Can I implement a special attribute like `__json__`?
325,2017-07-22T10:26:12.134282,Suellen,marshmallow is the tool to go
325,2017-07-22T10:27:17.139815,Fern,what should I use for web dev?
325,2017-07-22T10:27:23.140297,Fern,Flask? aiohttp?
325,2017-07-22T10:30:25.155406,Suellen,"oh, it's up to you completely, there are too many options for one to be considered the only way :slightly_smiling_face:"
325,2017-07-22T10:30:28.155649,Fern,I'm searching for something that can handle async methods since I'm going to fetch data from external HTTP APIs

325,2017-07-22T10:36:32.187822,Fern,so I would be better of to use aiohttp?

I was hoping to get some direction I get error 54 connection reset.   I am going to supply the full script as a snip right after this message.  This is a super basic thing to download some RFC as a test of learning Sockets a bit.
335,2017-07-24T09:27:25.173078,Gabriele,"""socket"" is lower-case, by the way... it's not a package, it's just a low-level networking concept. Error 54 / ""connection reset"" is just an obscure way of the operating system telling you that the connection was closed."
335,2017-07-24T09:29:58.253576,Gabriele,"It is usually helpful to know which line the error came from (it'll be in the traceback). It also looks like your HTTP request is missing a blank line after the header, but maybe I've misremembered that part"

335,2017-07-24T09:40:03.583055,Patty,<@Ressie> any reason for sockets over just making HTTP requests?
335,2017-07-24T09:42:28.663283,Patty,"Additionally, that site is served over HTTPS. so you’ll need to use SSL to make the requests then via sockets"
335,2017-07-24T09:48:08.854373,Ressie,<@Patty> simple exercise. I would normaly work up the stack.  I am just trying to get a deep understanding of said lower stacks.
335,2017-07-24T09:49:40.907482,Patty,"okay, well you’ll have to use SSL since <http://ietf.org|ietf.org> forces https. there may be some better exercises for playing with sockets, like some real-time communication for instance"
335,2017-07-24T09:50:06.921689,Ressie,if you have a good excersie shoot it my way
335,2017-07-24T09:50:25.932699,Gabriele,maybe if you can run an echo server locally then you can test connecting to that
335,2017-07-24T09:50:48.945992,Gabriele,(e.g. <https://gist.github.com/solusipse/6419144> looks okay - and you can modify that code too)

335,2017-07-24T10:09:14.619907,Suellen,should work regardless

341,2017-07-24T16:43:15.281201,Johnetta,"So the default value I would be adding to keys without a date would be an erroneous date. I'd like for them to remain ""None"". If that makes sense."
341,2017-07-24T16:44:46.328722,Johnetta,As is I can't sort `TypeError: can't compare datetime.datetime to NoneType`

341,2017-07-24T16:46:16.375538,Johnetta,But it isn't clean is all.

342,2017-07-24T21:39:55.788167,Thomasina,PostGIS doesn't return any results for `ST_DWithin`. I'm having a lot of difficulty figuring it out
343,2017-07-24T21:50:16.910884,Christa,"Hi, does anyone have time to help me with a simple regex string?"
343,2017-07-24T21:54:27.960031,Beula,"<@Christa> You usually have the best luck just posting the question, someone will usually be along to help out"
343,2017-07-24T22:00:03.027249,Christa,"Ok. So my question is: 

I have the following folder structure: 

C:\ 
    -0.82\

I have this line of code: 

`app.connect(path=r""C:\0.82\file.exe"")`

Then, the C:\ folder gets updated and I have this: 


C:\ 
    -0.82\
    -0.86\

Now I want to use regex to connect to the folder 0.86\

`app.connect(path=r""C:\0.\d\d\file.exe"")`

But that wasn't right and I don't understand regex.  Can someone please describe how to use regex correctly in this scenario?"
343,2017-07-24T22:04:44.083739,Beula,Is the file update deterministic? If so - you may not want regex
343,2017-07-24T22:06:13.100620,Beula,"My guess is one of your issues will be the backslashes from the windows path, which are ""escape sequences"" in regex, so `C:\0.\d`, `\0.` probably isn't what you want, `\0` is escaping ""0"" and then `.` is any char, I think a starting point may be: `C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe`"

343,2017-07-24T22:07:06.110855,Jame,Can any one suggest the document for managing pcap files for replaying SNMP traps?
343,2017-07-24T22:11:35.162251,Christa,The file update is somewhat incremental
343,2017-07-24T22:12:36.173957,Christa,I'm not sure what's going on. There is an 'r' prefixed in the string so its a raw string and \\ is not needed to escape the file path \ in this case. Can you update your answer with this in mind?
343,2017-07-24T22:15:42.209059,Beula,"It actually does need the escapes in the regex string, it gets compiled and `\d` is a ""digit"", and `\0` isn't anything, so your regex needs to escape"
343,2017-07-24T22:16:42.220407,Beula,"If you read the docs for the `re` package - you'll see the same behavior I describe, all the raw strings still escape the special chars"
343,2017-07-24T22:17:48.232771,Collette,<@Jame> what google says: <http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/>
343,2017-07-24T22:20:50.266769,Beula,"<@Christa> Here is a snippet from the official docs:

&gt; Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write '\\\\' as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\ inside a regular Python string literal.
&gt; 
&gt; *The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r'. So r""\n"" is a two-character string containing '\' and 'n', while ""\n"" is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation."
343,2017-07-24T22:22:47.288160,Christa,"I'm sort of confused.  Do I have to prefix the string with a function 

 re(`C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe`)"
343,2017-07-24T22:23:04.291475,Christa,"re(`""C:\\0\.\d{2}\\file.exe""`)"

343,2017-07-24T22:23:45.298944,Christa,"in this case, its just file directories.. How do I got about choosing?"
343,2017-07-24T22:24:03.302712,Beula,Choosing between what?
343,2017-07-24T22:24:09.303811,Christa,Folder names
343,2017-07-24T22:24:19.305664,Beula,"As I said before, I believe regex is the wrong approach"
343,2017-07-24T22:24:33.308362,Christa,Any suggestions to the correct approach?
343,2017-07-24T22:24:41.309871,Christa,Or at least a working one
343,2017-07-24T22:25:10.315561,Beula,"If it's always an incrementing number, the easy solution is list the directory (`os.listdir`), convert them into floats, and take the highest"

343,2017-07-24T22:29:33.365407,Christa,"As a follow up, as a beginner python programmer, how was I supposed to know that os.listdir was a valid path to take without asking someone else for their sage advice"
343,2017-07-24T22:30:07.371701,Beula,"You did the right thing, you asked for help! That's a good way to find other solutions."
343,2017-07-24T22:30:30.376383,Beula,"What you had is called an X-Y problem, you wanted to get the next file - and thought regex was the answer so you asked how to do the regex"
343,2017-07-24T22:30:49.380155,Beula,"Those of us that have been around the block once or twice try to understand the actual problem, to make sure we answer the right question"
343,2017-07-24T22:33:32.411399,Christa,"You're right.  I shouldve just asked how to do it, at first. I still want to learn how to use regex tho :stuck_out_tongue:"
343,2017-07-24T22:33:56.416011,Christa,"Oh well, hopefully another time. Thanks, again!"
343,2017-07-24T22:34:10.418754,Beula,"If you want to do the regex way you'd do something similar, you'd use a ""capture group"", convert them to floats, then compare. Much more involved and harder to maintain :smile:"

What's le difference?"
345,2017-07-25T01:56:04.450205,Willena,<@Thomasina> the first example sets an SRID of 4386 (WGS84).  the second example doesn't set an SRID and should get the default for geometry which is 0
345,2017-07-25T02:02:29.525265,Thomasina,<@Willena> Will that cause a big difference in the resulting values?
345,2017-07-25T02:12:00.638348,Willena,"Depends what your doing.  When SRID is 0, the data gets treated like it's on a Cartesian plane (flat).  Using 4326 allows for a round earth.  If you're trying to do things like get the distance between two points, it can make a difference."

anyone would know why `mimetypes.guess_type('my_file.csv')` returns `('application/vns.ms-excel', None)` instead of `('text/csv', None)` like Linux does? The file does not even exist."
347,2017-07-25T05:32:13.469262,Ciera,Maybe because the default software for it is `excel` and windows do some tricks
347,2017-07-25T05:32:24.473595,Ciera,is it doing the same with an existing file ?

347,2017-07-25T05:56:39.013084,Ciera,postgres might need a restart when you install postgis

347,2017-07-25T05:59:43.081340,Meg,because you can't update certain files when the system is running
347,2017-07-25T05:59:53.085159,Meg,so you ether need to restart the service or reboot

350,2017-07-25T08:36:24.147201,Suellen,<@Gabriele> Apache in 2017?
350,2017-07-25T08:40:03.234198,Gabriele,"Sure, go old school "
350,2017-07-25T08:40:19.241036,Gabriele,Nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM
350,2017-07-25T08:40:25.242965,Gabriele,... etc
350,2017-07-25T08:41:01.257636,Suellen,don't forget mod_perl
350,2017-07-25T09:03:59.877763,Gabriele,"I would start by moving it all into one function, which gets called once. Then I'd move parts of it into various individual functions based on grouping lumps of shared functionality together. For example, each block of logic in a for loop is a candidate for a function because it's related code that gets called on a succession of data"
351,2017-07-25T08:58:53.727928,Gabriele,"nah, straight to CGI, none of this crazy new tech"
351,2017-07-25T09:04:24.889612,Gabriele,I'd also consider ditching things like `range(len(target_column_G))` which is usually the wrong way to iterate over something in Python
351,2017-07-25T09:05:22.917764,Gertude,"<@Gabriele> Thank you, I read about functions except I never really implemented one, any dummy proof example on this snippet how can I have them in a function?"
351,2017-07-25T09:06:20.946559,Gabriele,"I think it's perhaps too fundamental a concept to explain in chat. Maybe a tutorial will help, e.g. <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm>"
351,2017-07-25T09:07:13.973268,Gertude,"Thank you, reading it"
351,2017-07-25T09:09:04.029382,Gertude,"What would you suggest, to continue working on getting new features and bigger code, or to prioritize implementing functions to clean it up?"
351,2017-07-25T09:09:35.045342,Meg,I'd priotize learning good design and structure
351,2017-07-25T09:10:09.062691,Meg,"because once you are able to structure a program effectively, adding new features and maintaining older code is much easier"
351,2017-07-25T09:13:57.177287,Gertude,Thank you
351,2017-07-25T09:14:30.194302,Gertude,<@Meg> Do you have any other notes other tha what <@Gabriele>  mentioned?
351,2017-07-25T09:15:36.227782,Meg,"he covered everything, I think"
351,2017-07-25T09:15:58.238737,Meg,and i'd use some blank lines for separation
351,2017-07-25T09:16:08.243880,Meg,for bits that really don't belong in a different function
351,2017-07-25T09:16:18.249385,Meg,group variables together by general area of responsibility
351,2017-07-25T09:16:54.268618,Gabriele,The problem with learning the right way to write programs is that a lot of it doesn't make much sense until you've gone through the process a few times
351,2017-07-25T09:17:54.301056,Gabriele,"I'd say just start small, clean things up, write functions, then maybe write classes, and read through the Python tutorial to understand all the tools available to you"
352,2017-07-25T09:43:57.167192,Gertude,So <@Gabriele> I should continue developing this and learning other simple functions then when confident enough I release another version with functions?
352,2017-07-25T09:44:35.189602,Gabriele,I don't know - what is your end goal here?
352,2017-07-25T10:08:22.051066,Myong,Having an issue with instantiation of a new object within another one as an attribute. I have two classes as such `class a` and `class b`
352,2017-07-25T10:08:51.069514,Myong,in class a under `__init__` I do `self.obj = b()`
352,2017-07-25T10:09:53.108850,Myong,and I attempt to run a function from `class b` via the `obj` variable through `self.obj.run_func()` within `class a`
352,2017-07-25T10:10:42.139402,Myong,"I think a line got deleted that I typed, can't quite tell..."
352,2017-07-25T10:11:32.171068,Myong,"But either way, `class b` isn't really a child as much as it's just an attribute of the `class a` but attempting to run a function within `class a` on the `obj` variable gives a reference error"
352,2017-07-25T10:11:40.176263,Gabriele,show the actual error
352,2017-07-25T10:12:21.201466,Myong,`Unresolved attribute reference to run_func in object b`
352,2017-07-25T10:12:54.222478,Myong,But the function is in the class
352,2017-07-25T10:13:22.240172,Suellen,but is it?
352,2017-07-25T10:13:32.246501,Gabriele,"Does it _actually_ say ""in object b"""
352,2017-07-25T10:14:08.269858,Myong,`in class b` the edits I am making keep deleting the whole lines
352,2017-07-25T10:14:18.275907,Gabriele,"classes aren't objects, so these details are critical"
352,2017-07-25T10:14:43.292296,Gabriele,"In your definition of `class b`, is there a method `run_func`?"
352,2017-07-25T10:14:49.296351,Myong,yes
352,2017-07-25T10:15:02.304186,Myong,But I'm also getting scope errors for self
352,2017-07-25T10:15:17.313323,Gabriele,"""scope errors"""

352,2017-07-25T10:15:40.328775,Gabriele,<@Suellen> You'll confuse things...

here you go :slightly_smiling_face:"
352,2017-07-25T10:16:11.348164,Myong,"yeah, but I don't understand exactly where it's coming from?"
352,2017-07-25T10:16:25.357330,Myong,Is it the import into the other module?
352,2017-07-25T10:16:28.359363,Gertude,"<@Gabriele> I am writing a software which is used by few customers now, it does the job now, but I am looking to both better myself and my code that's all, so seeking advice if in your opinion I should let it stay the same for now till I learn more or continue working on adding more then later enhance."
352,2017-07-25T10:16:28.359595,Gabriele,"errors typically tell you exactly where they come from, with a line number"
352,2017-07-25T10:16:47.371204,Myong,Ah shiet
352,2017-07-25T10:16:52.374763,Myong,"Got it, bad indent into init"
352,2017-07-25T10:17:00.379676,Gabriele,"<@Gertude> For your personal development you should read more about the language and practice with it, improving your code as you go"
352,2017-07-25T10:17:26.395719,Gertude,Got it thank you

352,2017-07-25T10:17:33.400336,Meg,is a great resource
352,2017-07-25T10:19:58.491935,Gertude,But I see it doesn't have intros and it's spot on to functions
352,2017-07-25T10:21:02.532841,Meg,correct
352,2017-07-25T10:21:14.540229,Meg,it gives you an item of specific consideration
352,2017-07-25T10:21:21.545140,Meg,and does a good evaluation throughout
352,2017-07-25T10:21:51.564086,Gabriele,"There's not really any good way to get good at programming without starting at the beginning and making sure you understand the fundamental building blocks: control flow statements, functions, variables and objects, types, structures and classes, etc"
352,2017-07-25T10:22:08.575027,Meg,I'm assuming <@Gertude> has some experience with that
352,2017-07-25T10:22:34.591885,Gabriele,"Above: _"" I read about functions except I never really implemented one""_"
352,2017-07-25T10:22:56.606287,Meg,oh
352,2017-07-25T10:23:07.613174,Gertude,"Yes true, I read and I know the fundamentals but to add two numbers and such"
352,2017-07-25T10:23:11.615650,Meg,"missed that, been in and out"
352,2017-07-25T10:23:30.628239,Gabriele,writing a function (along with creating your own classes) are part of the fundamentals
352,2017-07-25T10:23:50.641188,Meg,fluent python might be better
352,2017-07-25T10:23:51.641610,Meg,<https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1500992603&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fluent+python>
352,2017-07-25T10:24:02.649045,Gertude,So I think back to the code I should implement a `re.finder` Function and pass the patterns later on
352,2017-07-25T10:24:41.674471,Gabriele,No... you wouldn't be adding a `finder` function to `re`
352,2017-07-25T10:25:16.697611,Gabriele,"But you could write a function that does contain all the 'finding', if you liked"
352,2017-07-25T10:25:26.704810,Gertude,Ah huh
352,2017-07-25T10:25:39.713201,Gertude,One function that has all the finding with all the patterns
352,2017-07-25T10:25:47.718140,Gertude,And when writing I call the right one?
352,2017-07-25T10:26:24.742554,Gabriele,I don't know what you mean by that. The alternative would be to call the wrong one...
352,2017-07-25T10:27:18.777132,Gertude,"The function would have the `re.findall` with all the patterns, and when writing to the csv I call one from what I define at the top"
352,2017-07-25T10:27:39.791179,Gertude,"Best to shut up and go read, thank you both"
353,2017-07-25T10:19:30.474435,Gertude,"<@Meg> Thank you, I get bored from intros though, because as you saw I can write some code that works but not happy with the quality."
354,2017-07-25T11:09:47.491356,Myong,Good for getting date input?
354,2017-07-25T11:13:19.631267,Gabriele,It looks like it would work
354,2017-07-25T12:17:46.228512,Myong,Is `ConfigParser` a pretty good tool for setting up constants
354,2017-07-25T12:17:51.231475,Myong,About to get started with it
354,2017-07-25T12:19:28.290991,Gabriele,"You don't really need it if you're not distributing or deploying your software, but for managing configuration constants, sure, it works"
354,2017-07-25T12:20:21.324317,Myong,"I've just got a global constant `.py` file with values, but I also need to be able to set global constants based on user input. They're being set in a class so I suppose I could always just pass the class object around and grab values that way, but I'm sort of looking for something a bit nicer"
354,2017-07-25T12:24:39.483920,Gabriele,if it's user input then configparser is the wrong tool
354,2017-07-25T12:29:47.673400,Junita,generally what I do these days is a combination of environment variables and Click for the CLI
354,2017-07-25T12:30:14.689803,Junita,loading from a .env file as well if people want to have stuff in there
354,2017-07-25T12:30:25.696957,Johana,i like having a .env.example file
354,2017-07-25T12:31:28.736529,Marilyn,^ Always helps clear up so many questions for most people
354,2017-07-25T12:32:57.789971,Junita,"and if it’s something like a flask app, I’ll usually tie it all together in a `config.py`"
355,2017-07-25T12:30:10.687514,Johana,:thumbsup: for click.
356,2017-07-25T13:03:24.883798,Bella,"Hey guys,  using `sqlalchemy`
I have field `created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)`
and I confused, How I can get data by datetime. For example, I need get data for current day.
and I did something like this.
```
 db.session.query(Post).join(User). \
            filter(Post.user_id == user_id). \
            filter(Post.user_type == 'eng').\
            filter(Post.created_at == get_today())
```

```
def get_today():
    return datetime.now()
```
But the example didn’t work("
356,2017-07-25T13:05:02.942685,Meg,are you getting None or something?
356,2017-07-25T13:05:29.958794,Bella,just empty array
356,2017-07-25T13:05:33.961184,Beula,Right now you are filtering based on this exact moment
356,2017-07-25T13:05:38.964396,Beula,so that understandably won't work
356,2017-07-25T13:05:50.971821,Bella,but in the database I have record with current day.
356,2017-07-25T13:05:56.975181,Meg,"day, yes"
356,2017-07-25T13:06:06.981631,Meg,"but not the current minute, second, hour of the request"
356,2017-07-25T13:06:18.988679,Beula,`datetime.now()` against a timefield will be date/time
356,2017-07-25T13:06:33.997944,Beula,`date.now()` may work
356,2017-07-25T13:07:37.035516,Beula,I think you may need a between query for start/end of the day
356,2017-07-25T13:08:43.074132,Myong,You think it's best to create a `.env` file for the user and give an example or create one if one does not exist in the directory and write to it?
356,2017-07-25T13:09:16.092730,Beula,"The standard is `.*rc` files, so I usually use `~/.foorc`"
356,2017-07-25T13:09:21.095715,Beula,At least on linux
356,2017-07-25T13:09:32.101830,Bella,"<@Beula> Yes, I need implement `between` too, but first need to implmenet for current day, 2 minutes, I’ll try"
356,2017-07-25T13:09:48.111192,Beula,"Well between start of day and end of day is ""current date"" - which is what I am getting at"
356,2017-07-25T13:15:08.296023,Myong,<@Johana> was it you that had the `example.env` file?
356,2017-07-25T13:17:19.371396,Johana,env.example ya
356,2017-07-25T13:17:33.379764,Johana,or `.env.example` my bad.
356,2017-07-25T13:19:27.445076,Johana,no but i can create one.

356,2017-07-25T13:21:12.504987,Johana,then you can run `cp .env.example .env`
356,2017-07-25T13:21:17.507863,Johana,and fill out the values
356,2017-07-25T13:21:27.513799,Johana,then run `source .env` and be good to go.
357,2017-07-25T13:17:56.392831,Myong,Is that in your gists?
358,2017-07-25T13:47:28.434680,Bella,"<@Beula>

But  for current day, it’s not working.. I understand in which way I need to move..:disappointed:"
358,2017-07-25T13:48:50.484749,Beula,I think you either want `&lt; get_today() + 1day` or to do `&lt;= get_today()`
358,2017-07-25T13:58:36.841026,Bella,"```
# Query

# first didn't work
return query.filter(Post.created_at == get_today())

# second 
# return posts after 25th July
return query.filter(Post.created_at &gt;= get_today())

def get_today():

359,2017-07-25T14:28:06.943200,Celine,"Hello,

I would like to test a system with several AMQP consumer/producers that are exchanging messages with each other.
I would like to have unit-testing with those consumers. Is there a commonly used design pattern for doing so in Python? (I'm using pytest at the moment with a fixture that look like this:"
359,2017-07-25T14:28:35.960519,Celine,"At the moment my set-up is this:
My consumers inherit from multiprocessing.Process and when started set-up their AMQP environment.
When the test is finished, the terminate closes the connection and cancel everything.
The problem that I get is that even when a test completed, the Process of the consumers seems to continue running in the background even after I called terminate.

How could I have a nice clean-up when the test is over? Would it change something to have BlockingConnection instead of a SelectConnection ?

Here is the current version of my base class for those components: <https://gist.github.com/sieben/caf39e04a83c812550d967a22b9d8584> is an obvious flaw in it? Is there an alternative from inheriting from Thread or Process ?"
360,2017-07-25T15:02:13.170089,Myong,Is there any way to run pycharm in debug with commandline arguments?
360,2017-07-25T15:03:13.205259,Meg,yes
360,2017-07-25T15:03:16.207279,Beula,"Yeah, you can use the same run menu with command line args and click the debug icon instead of play - or are you seeing something funky?"
360,2017-07-25T15:03:17.207513,Meg,go to run configuration
360,2017-07-25T15:11:35.482919,Myong,Is it under the script parameters
360,2017-07-25T15:18:42.712369,Beula,Yep
360,2017-07-25T15:18:53.718262,Beula,those are the args passed to it
360,2017-07-25T15:19:48.747486,Myong,Got it
360,2017-07-25T15:52:27.802808,Myong,I'm using a module called `simple_settings` and after a few times of accessing the configured settings I get
360,2017-07-25T15:53:39.842223,Myong,lol
360,2017-07-25T15:54:19.863541,Myong,But the stack trace pretty much shows all calls to the `simple_settings` module and I really don't understand why. I think I may just not use that at all to be honest. But wasn't sure if it was a mistake I made
360,2017-07-25T15:57:34.972744,Myong,It seems to be going between these two
360,2017-07-25T16:00:54.090145,Ciera,well the stacktraces is pretty explicit
360,2017-07-25T16:01:03.094580,Ciera,python as a recursion limit that you reached
360,2017-07-25T16:01:28.108771,Myong,"Yeah, I guess maybe I didn't actually setup the module properly"
360,2017-07-25T16:01:58.126542,Myong,But it's odd that it goes between the two over and over I'm trying to get to it in debug
360,2017-07-25T16:02:15.136511,Ciera,well in fact the `__getattr__` func call `setup` and `setup` call `__getattr__` so it's endless
360,2017-07-25T16:03:23.174341,Myong,cant even debug to where it breaks
360,2017-07-25T16:04:18.204835,Ciera,well it breaks as soon as the class is init or called
360,2017-07-25T16:04:27.209811,Ciera,as `__getattr__` is used quite a lot
360,2017-07-25T16:06:58.291672,Myong,"Yeah, looking at some stuff now it basically says if `__getattrb__` can access a variable which does not yet exist it will go into infinite recursion"
360,2017-07-25T16:14:45.543796,Myong,"alright got rid of the module, not sure what was happening, figured out a different way"

If I add only X into requirement.txt, then I can get auto download Y,Z when installing my app in a new env. Or I use `pip freeze` to dump `X,Y,Z` into requirement.txt.
Which way I should follow? I feel like the former make my txt look cleaner and bring the same value, is that right?"
364,2017-07-26T03:53:43.677673,Fleta,<@Hermina> In my opinion it's better to add only depends that is needed by your project and leave pip decide what else should be installed.
364,2017-07-26T03:54:29.693151,Hermina,so you mean we should avoid pip freeze?
364,2017-07-26T03:59:14.788559,Fleta,I mean what I say)
364,2017-07-26T03:59:30.794032,Hermina,haha alright
364,2017-07-26T04:05:05.916062,Junita,"what kind of project are we talking about here?  if it’s a library, you’ll want to avoid being so specific.  if it’s the end product, you’ll definitely want to be freezing your dependencies to exact versions"
364,2017-07-26T04:10:29.030438,Marcie,in both cases i would say to freeze all dependencies with `pip freeze` anyways and then put `pip list --outdated` as part of your continuous integration process to let you know about newer versions
364,2017-07-26T04:14:23.115494,Junita,"I think it’s problematic for a library to specifically require a version of its dependencies, since unlike say npm Python dependencies are global"
364,2017-07-26T04:14:51.125833,Junita,"I’m pretty sure if I have two dependencies, A and B, which both depend on C, and they specify different versions of C, there is going to be a problem, right?"
364,2017-07-26T04:15:17.135032,Ciera,yeah don't do that

369,2017-07-26T10:08:26.587834,Gabriele,Most likely you're just wrong about what val1 and val2 are. Probably they are different types
369,2017-07-26T10:08:42.597671,Gabriele,Which is one reason why using a dict instead of something typesafe is a bad idea
369,2017-07-26T10:09:02.611205,Meg,"what if you do 

`{'key': int(val1) + int(val2)}`?"

371,2017-07-26T10:53:09.360949,Suellen,shouldn't it work even if you profile the whole application that loads a module?
371,2017-07-26T10:53:19.367374,Suellen,i.e. that module will be profiled too as a part of a bigger profiling...
371,2017-07-26T10:54:29.415847,January,OK thanks. and what about sub processing ? will it profile those as well ?
371,2017-07-26T10:55:06.440442,Ruben,"In other words, you can't use mutable things as dictionary keys."
371,2017-07-26T10:55:34.459443,Ruben,"Strings like ""Helo"" and tuples like (1,2,3) are immutable. But a list is mutable, so you can't use a list as a key."

371,2017-07-26T13:22:11.060843,Marilyn,You could have your application read a config 
371,2017-07-26T13:22:26.069743,Marilyn,I think it would depend on how many settings there are to change
371,2017-07-26T13:25:11.165027,Marilyn,Something like this <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/configparser.html>

374,2017-07-26T14:30:15.533669,Myong,"Does anyone use `configparser`? Pretty sure I've asked this before, but just wondering"
374,2017-07-26T14:31:27.579033,Ciera,I usually use `yaml` for configuration
374,2017-07-26T14:34:11.677044,Johana,i’ve used it before. it’s pretty nice. i also like yaml.
374,2017-07-26T14:34:19.681397,Myong,"I'm just trying to figure out if it's best practice to grab data for each variable with the configparser module individually like when needed, or setup something like `glob.py` and set them all at once in there"
374,2017-07-26T14:34:44.696370,Johana,configparser is ini files so if your used to microsoft world its less parity.
374,2017-07-26T14:36:36.762137,Myong,Because it seems that when you're compiling if the object that holds all the config stuff doesn't exist and you attempt to import them into some sort of globals file you get errors
374,2017-07-26T14:36:43.765695,Myong,so I'm trying to see what most do
374,2017-07-26T14:37:14.784228,Myong,Like should I grab the values and set them as attributes as part of classes/objects
374,2017-07-26T14:43:23.002051,Myong,<@Johana> <@Ciera> are you just using `pyyaml`?
374,2017-07-26T14:43:55.020514,Ciera,yeah.
374,2017-07-26T14:44:23.037041,Myong,"so I can essentially just load in the yaml, store it in a settings variable and import the settings variable everywhere"
374,2017-07-26T14:46:12.101212,Ciera,exactly. You might want to perform some check on it or put some default value but yeah that's the idea
374,2017-07-26T14:50:23.247653,Johana,i think pyyaml is the defacto.
374,2017-07-26T14:51:24.283356,Ciera,just be careful the import is `yaml`
374,2017-07-26T14:51:41.292671,Myong,got it.
374,2017-07-26T14:54:29.392128,Myong,should I use the `- item` or `[item]` for a list?
374,2017-07-26T14:55:48.438707,Ciera,Personally I prefer `- item` but depend if you have a long list I guess
374,2017-07-26T14:57:33.500907,Myong,okay wow this is insanely more simple
374,2017-07-26T14:58:56.550290,Myong,is there a reason to maintain a globals file for any reason with the yaml
374,2017-07-26T15:00:04.591113,Ciera,depends what you want to be user configurable or not
374,2017-07-26T15:06:27.816048,Myong,I think I'm gonna just leave the .yaml file for someone to add more items to if they want to configure it any more. I'm gonna use `tkinter` to make dropdowns to select an item from lists
375,2017-07-26T16:06:44.795802,Suellen,tkinter is alright!

376,2017-07-26T17:01:22.589392,Beula,Not sure of your issue there though
376,2017-07-26T17:01:34.595972,Myong,Yeah it's odd you could be right though
376,2017-07-26T17:01:43.600897,Myong,I had super earlier actually it was working find
376,2017-07-26T17:01:48.603518,Myong,fine now that I think about it
376,2017-07-26T17:02:19.620221,Beula,I think it's how you're passing to the super though
376,2017-07-26T17:02:45.634353,Beula,"I think the signature is `Frame(master, ...options)` - so you may need to unpack your dict as options"
376,2017-07-26T17:02:53.638630,Beula,"`super().__init__(parent, **options)`"
376,2017-07-26T17:04:18.684192,Myong,"oh wait, I don't need to pass `self` to super... :facepalm:"
376,2017-07-26T17:05:37.725634,Myong,"hmmm, still same issue"
376,2017-07-26T17:07:25.781445,Myong,turns out tkinter Frames object cant take in 3 arguments unless the 3rd is a dictionary
376,2017-07-26T17:08:02.800067,Beula,"I was trying to find the docs on the signature more, they are certainly lacking"
376,2017-07-26T17:08:15.806796,Myong,Yeah pretty abysmal tbh
376,2017-07-26T17:08:18.808504,Myong,Nearly done though
376,2017-07-26T17:12:09.921062,Myong,And another issue... How am I supposed to pass in anything to this class if it cant take more than one argument...
376,2017-07-26T17:15:16.010829,Beula,What do you mean? Only the parent can't take more than one - your class can though
377,2017-07-26T19:30:34.909485,Kari,are there anymore easter eggs in python than 'import this'?

379,2017-07-26T21:31:10.547684,Marcie,<@Chanel> yup! by default `arg_parse()` just looks for the command line arguments from `sys.argv` but you can pass your own list of arguments to it

382,2017-07-27T01:31:41.106684,Marcie,that'd do it!
382,2017-07-27T01:43:35.228448,Marcie,<@Delisa> technically `subprocess.Popen` has a `communicate` method to do this
382,2017-07-27T01:43:52.231263,Marcie,but after 10 years of python i still can never get any subprocess thing to handle input properly and i hate it
382,2017-07-27T01:55:45.357365,Marcie,ooh cool i found a handy library called `sh` that isn't awful
382,2017-07-27T01:56:09.361996,Marcie,"<@Delisa> you can use `sh` to easily get this result:
```import sh

print(result.stdout)```"
382,2017-07-27T02:02:15.434297,Marcie,its like subprocess for humans

382,2017-07-27T02:07:06.491192,Ciera,seems nice
382,2017-07-27T02:32:35.813367,Delisa,<@Marcie> I tried it already. But it's asking for password.
382,2017-07-27T02:33:22.824178,Marcie,<@Delisa> yeah i couldn't get the `subprocess.Popen` version working without asking for a password either
382,2017-07-27T02:33:27.825325,Marcie,the `sh` version works though
382,2017-07-27T02:34:18.836802,Delisa,"<@Marcie> Sorry subprocess is not working, But sh is working fine."
382,2017-07-27T02:35:18.850538,Delisa,Correct. But documentation saying like that subprocess will work.
382,2017-07-27T02:41:01.927819,Delisa,<@Marcie> Thank you. One problem is that will work for linux versions only. I want to work it for windows also.
383,2017-07-27T01:29:55.087716,Delisa,"Hi all,
I want to write a program to get the MySQL status through the command line.
E.g The command what I am doing is 
`msqladmin -u username -p password status`
(there is no space between -p and password.)
But I don't want to provide password through the command line. But give the input as password to the command line on asking password. Like 
```
msqladmin -u username -p status

password ******

```
Is there a way to do it?"
384,2017-07-27T01:59:26.398549,Ciera,is it just a subprocess with some helpers ?
385,2017-07-27T09:31:50.581811,Myong,"Hey guys, working in tkinter and having an issue with the Frames I am instantiating are going in the wrong order. Maybe it's something stupid, but I'm not too sure."
385,2017-07-27T11:09:29.799678,Myong,"I need to attach a command to a button in tkinter, and it has to be able to attach to another widget/Frame which does not yet exist. So without using `lambda` I get an error because the key does not exist within the dictionary"
385,2017-07-27T11:09:41.807144,Myong,But I also need to run more than one single expression
385,2017-07-27T11:09:51.813842,Myong,How can I reference something that does not exist?
385,2017-07-27T11:31:17.671244,Myong,It sucks because it works with `command=lambda: ` but with a `command=func` which I sort of need because I need to grab some data from the fields when the button is clicked.
385,2017-07-27T11:32:11.707725,Beula,Look at `functools.partial`
385,2017-07-27T11:33:28.760751,Myong,Well here's what happens
385,2017-07-27T11:33:34.764928,Myong,So I have a main root for my application
385,2017-07-27T11:33:48.774151,Suellen,&gt; It sucks because it works with `command=lambda: ` but with a `command=func` which I sort of need because I need to grab some data from the fields when the button is clicked.
385,2017-07-27T11:33:51.776292,Myong,"and I have 3 classes, one for each different ""page"" which are all `Tk.Frame` objects"
385,2017-07-27T11:34:04.785048,Suellen,"`lambda: func(button1.text, button2.text)`?"

385,2017-07-27T11:35:37.845978,Myong,Slightly confusing I will show code
385,2017-07-27T11:35:58.860346,Suellen,"wait, lambdas ""execute"" when you access them"
385,2017-07-27T11:36:27.879796,Suellen,i.e. `lambda: func(x)` - `func` won't be called until you click the button
385,2017-07-27T11:36:38.886822,Myong,There is basically a `dict` with `Frame: Frame obj`
385,2017-07-27T11:37:28.920152,Myong,"When it hit's the Repos Frame, it gets to this function"

385,2017-07-27T11:38:21.955988,Beula,Neither will a function though
385,2017-07-27T11:38:24.957682,Myong,which breaks at the last line
385,2017-07-27T11:38:30.962053,Myong,With a key_error

385,2017-07-27T11:39:25.998653,Suellen,"here you're not saying ""call `submit` when clicked"""
385,2017-07-27T11:39:27.000265,Myong,let me try `lambda: func()`

385,2017-07-27T11:44:37.206352,Suellen,wut
385,2017-07-27T11:45:30.242377,Suellen,"here's a piece of code from a project of mine which uses Tk:
```
self.master.after(timeout, lambda: self.update_treeview(treeview, data, timeout))

385,2017-07-27T11:45:38.247910,Suellen,the same principle
385,2017-07-27T11:46:52.296761,Myong,It works
385,2017-07-27T11:47:01.302682,Suellen,:slightly_smiling_face:
385,2017-07-27T11:47:21.316431,Myong,also `lambda: func()` works. Should have just done that....
385,2017-07-27T12:02:52.938750,Myong,"<@Suellen> since it seems you've used tkinter, what's the best way to go about passing data to another Frame. I'm trying to grab a selection and place it inside a label to show a user what they selected, but in the same way as before it places the default value into the label instead of grabbing the updated one."
385,2017-07-27T12:02:57.941753,Beula,If `lambda: func()` works just `func` should also work...
385,2017-07-27T12:03:06.947853,Myong,But it doesn't that's the thing lol
385,2017-07-27T12:03:32.964659,Beula,"Lambda is just a function reference, without a name. so setting `lambda: func()` is the same as `func`"
385,2017-07-27T12:04:16.994138,Beula,"Sounds like some other error, but if it works that's good :smile: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
385,2017-07-27T12:06:22.075041,Myong,"It's because it, for whatever reason attempts to access a key in a dict that doesn't exist and it steps into the function i attach to `command` if I just do `lambda: func()` it doesn't actually go into the function til it's finally clicked"
385,2017-07-27T12:06:44.089417,Collette,"<@Beula> `func` and `lambda: func(foo, bar)` are different :wink:"
385,2017-07-27T12:07:07.103823,Beula,Which is why I recommended using a partial as an alternative
385,2017-07-27T12:07:57.136026,Beula,"Anyway, in tkinter you see a ton of `lambda: thing()` so it't not out of the norm :smile:"
385,2017-07-27T12:14:17.369673,Suellen,<@Myong> can you show a bit of code? maybe it's something obvious
385,2017-07-27T12:18:33.525022,Suellen,nooo waaay

385,2017-07-27T12:21:40.636904,Myong,I just need 4 screens
385,2017-07-27T12:21:42.638484,Myong,that's it
385,2017-07-27T12:21:43.638884,Suellen,there's a good side though: you better understand what happens under the wraps in other GUI frameworks
385,2017-07-27T12:21:46.640666,Myong,god is this bad
385,2017-07-27T12:22:02.650435,Myong,"Should have just made a frontend, honestly"
385,2017-07-27T12:23:40.708157,Myong,just attempting to format this is so bad.
385,2017-07-27T12:24:27.735698,Beula,"That's a bit rude, but I challenge you to show me how this case above is not the same, vs just saying it's not. Here is proof it is:

```

...
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar = lambda: print(""bar"")
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
foo
&gt;&gt;&gt; bar()

You can pass around `bar` or `foo` to any function that needs a callable (with no args in this case)"

&gt;&gt;&gt; type(foo)
&lt;class 'function'&gt;

&lt;class 'function'&gt;

385,2017-07-27T12:26:30.808725,Suellen,"rude? man, I specifically joked about a cup-of-coffee so that doesn't seem rude :disappointed:"

385,2017-07-27T12:27:40.850587,Myong,"I legitimately just have two frames of a 2 labels, a dropdown and a button"
385,2017-07-27T12:27:41.851274,Beula,Is what I was referring to
385,2017-07-27T12:27:47.855007,Myong,and I can't get them to do anything lol
385,2017-07-27T12:27:51.856987,Myong,Format wise
385,2017-07-27T12:28:19.873458,Suellen,&gt; You can pass around `bar` or `foo` to any function that needs a callable (with no args in this case)

385,2017-07-27T12:28:41.886693,Suellen,but
385,2017-07-27T12:28:43.888136,Beula,effectively foo and bar are the same here
385,2017-07-27T12:29:37.919839,Suellen,"tkinter callbacks don't accept arguments, they are all callables compatible with `lambda: x`"
385,2017-07-27T12:30:06.937005,Suellen,but you almost always need to pass something that takes a whole lot of arguments
385,2017-07-27T12:30:30.951262,Beula,This talk wasn't directly about tkinter
385,2017-07-27T12:30:33.952986,Suellen,therefore it's a common pattern to hide the stuff that you actually need to do behind a simple unassuming lambda
385,2017-07-27T12:30:46.961225,Beula,"that was the general context, but not to my comment about `lambda: foo()` and `foo` being the same"
385,2017-07-27T12:31:13.977577,Myong,alright I got it. Now I need a progress bar.
385,2017-07-27T12:31:43.995924,Suellen,alright then :slightly_smiling_face:
385,2017-07-27T12:32:06.009426,Suellen,we're both wrong and right in 50% of contexts :slightly_smiling_face:

386,2017-07-27T11:32:33.723553,Beula,You can make a partially applied function and delay the execution
386,2017-07-27T11:33:14.750497,Beula,Is the function invoked right away though? Either one seems like it should fail

388,2017-07-27T13:18:15.622881,Winnifred,"`replication ,` can’t happen"
388,2017-07-27T13:18:35.634235,Sade,"you mean `replication, `?  or am i missing where there’s a space?"
388,2017-07-27T13:18:40.637174,Winnifred,shouldn’t it be `replication:`
388,2017-07-27T13:18:43.638619,Sade,oooooh yes
388,2017-07-27T13:18:43.638829,Meg,"yeah, in your second dict in the list"
388,2017-07-27T13:18:49.642332,Sade,thank you for the eyeballs :smile:
388,2017-07-27T13:19:00.648611,Meg,should be `'replication': { ...}`
388,2017-07-27T13:19:06.652071,Winnifred,^^
388,2017-07-27T13:19:09.653571,Sade,facepalm :stuck_out_tongue:
388,2017-07-27T13:19:14.655996,Meg,you have it in two locations
388,2017-07-27T13:19:27.663691,Meg,both `replication` keys
388,2017-07-27T13:19:42.672242,Sade,fixed!
388,2017-07-27T13:19:55.679755,Winnifred,:boom:
388,2017-07-27T13:20:02.683383,Sade,duhhhhhhhh
388,2017-07-27T13:20:26.697056,Meg,sometimes its the little things
388,2017-07-27T13:20:37.703555,Meg,and things like this is where using an editor or IDE helps
388,2017-07-27T13:20:48.710136,Meg,because it can check your code for syntax validity as you write it
388,2017-07-27T13:20:59.716053,Meg,not so much with the shell or ipython
388,2017-07-27T13:22:50.780251,Sade,"<@Meg> actually i use vim with syntax highlighting and it runs flake8 on everything when saving, and somehow it just decided i must be trying to do some other valid thing in python"
388,2017-07-27T13:23:02.787410,Sade,at least my test suite figured out it was a problem :stuck_out_tongue:
388,2017-07-27T13:23:31.803979,Meg,"oh, interesting"
388,2017-07-27T13:23:31.804544,Meg,:slightly_smiling_face:
388,2017-07-27T13:23:45.812061,Sade,test suites FTW
388,2017-07-27T13:23:51.815226,Meg,so flake8 said that was valid python?
388,2017-07-27T13:23:52.816259,Meg,interesting
388,2017-07-27T13:24:28.837075,Sade,yeah idunno what it thought i was looking for
388,2017-07-27T13:24:30.838223,Meg,you may want to write a bug report about that on their gitlab
388,2017-07-27T13:24:39.843472,Meg,include that dict structure as an example
388,2017-07-27T13:24:41.844624,Sade,that’s not a bad idea
388,2017-07-27T13:24:55.852207,Sade,worst case there really is some half valid reason for syntax like that and they close it
388,2017-07-27T13:25:00.855182,Meg,yup
388,2017-07-27T13:25:52.885548,Meg,don't see anything on the tracker about dictionaries that applies
388,2017-07-27T13:25:57.888632,Meg,"so, maybe an edge case?"
388,2017-07-27T13:30:21.044378,Sade,<https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8/issues/353>
388,2017-07-27T14:58:32.173473,Myong,omg it works
388,2017-07-27T15:08:32.511741,Junita,:awwyea:
388,2017-07-27T15:10:10.563324,Hattie,"Cool, thanks."
388,2017-07-27T15:18:02.809167,Meghan,Anyone update PyCharm in the last couple of days and have your colors change?
389,2017-07-27T14:46:16.743446,Myong,Finally finished this stupid gui. It should work
390,2017-07-27T15:09:06.529675,Hattie,"Hey everyone. I need some help with django, particualrly behave-django. I have some tests, some of which are dependent on there being some entries in a specific table. I thought Django would run migrations when it sets up the test database and created one but to no avail. I'd like to know if there's a way to add those table entries after the test database has been created. I'm using DRF."
390,2017-07-27T15:09:28.541586,Beula,You may want to ask in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> <@Hattie> instead of here
390,2017-07-27T15:20:09.875458,Meghan,I don't think function names were colored before.
390,2017-07-27T15:30:49.211842,Beula,Mine have been for as long as I can recall - but maybe it accidentally overrode your config
390,2017-07-27T15:31:42.240719,Meghan,"It looks like many of the colors changed a bit. I don't remember what color functions were, maybe they were highlighted, but it is different. The TODO: colors also look a little different."
390,2017-07-27T15:59:38.128710,Ciera,<@Meghan> yeah my colors got changed too
390,2017-07-27T16:00:04.143345,Meghan,<@Ciera> Are they easy to change back? I think I liked the old ones better.
391,2017-07-27T15:57:18.051831,Salome,"has anyone used the attribute ""placeholder"" when using pyramid and deform?"
391,2017-07-27T15:57:50.069051,Salome,I need to add a placeholder to a field but Im not actually coding an html page. so this would need to be done while constructing the schema of the table fields
391,2017-07-27T16:00:49.169740,Ciera,Yeah color are easy to edit. But you need to figure out what they where before. I launched the previous version and compared some
391,2017-07-27T16:00:51.170874,Beula,"Oh I guess I am on the EAP, I guess mine have been _different_ for a while :facepalm:"
391,2017-07-27T16:01:10.180550,Ciera,Mine were changed with 2017.2
391,2017-07-27T16:03:53.269190,Meghan,"I tried the IntelliJ theme, I can't stand it, it's too bright and the colors don't stand out much."
391,2017-07-27T16:05:00.304306,Ciera,I use darcula with small modification 
391,2017-07-27T16:05:26.318193,Meghan,"Yeah, that's what I use. Only issue I have with the prior to this week colors is that I want multi-line TODOs."
391,2017-07-27T16:05:43.326828,Meghan,That's more of how it parses those than the color though.
391,2017-07-27T16:09:06.431629,Beula,multiline todos would be nice - have you had that working before?
391,2017-07-27T16:09:12.434756,Meghan,I haven't.
391,2017-07-27T16:09:18.437788,Meghan,Just something I would like to see.
391,2017-07-27T16:09:24.440918,Beula,"Aww, I thought you were about to make my week!"
391,2017-07-27T16:13:50.577264,Meghan,"It would be something worth requesting, I would think."
391,2017-07-27T16:13:57.581150,Meghan,Maybe I'll offer to pay for a year if they add it.
391,2017-07-27T17:33:07.971767,Deedee,"yeah.. this works for me if I have zip file that extracts to csv if csv not there. But print ""csv-filename already exists"" if csv w/ same same already exists."
391,2017-07-27T17:55:56.531641,Deedee,"update line 1 to:
```
import os
import os.path
from zipfile import ZipFile
```"
391,2017-07-27T17:56:46.551821,Deedee,this `zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(file_name)` to `zip_ref = ZipFile(file_name)`
391,2017-07-27T17:59:11.609328,Thelma,"quick question assume I have a list `[""abc"",""ab"",""cda"" ..]` I want to remove all elements that are substring i.e. in this case it would be `[""abc"",""cda""]`"
391,2017-07-27T18:00:08.633655,Thelma,what is the quickest way to do that?
391,2017-07-27T18:00:16.637497,Jed,len?
391,2017-07-27T18:00:47.650866,Thelma,huh?
391,2017-07-27T18:02:06.682706,Beula,<@Thelma> what have you tried?
391,2017-07-27T18:02:18.687426,Beula,We like to see what you've tried before just giving answers :)
391,2017-07-27T18:04:06.728668,Thelma,"```for e in li:
any([ x in e for x in e if x !=e])
```"
391,2017-07-27T18:05:20.757067,Deedee,<@Jed> moving our convo as comments/thread into your last code snippet
391,2017-07-27T18:05:27.759700,Beula,"You want a substring, right? So I'm not sure a `!=` makes sense "
391,2017-07-27T18:05:39.764280,Beula,Try `in`
391,2017-07-27T18:05:49.768038,Thelma,I have that as well
391,2017-07-27T18:05:56.770498,Thelma,just ensures it doesn’t check the same element
391,2017-07-27T18:06:03.773256,Deedee,"<@Jed>  here, actually"
391,2017-07-27T18:06:11.776015,Beula,"Also any returns a Boolean, aren't you trying to remove from the list?"
391,2017-07-27T18:06:20.779547,Jed,from zipfile import ZipFile doesn’t work actually. I’m using Python 2.7
391,2017-07-27T18:06:21.780129,Beula,"Or filter it down, rather "
391,2017-07-27T18:06:39.786649,Deedee,"So make these changes. Also, what are you trying to do w/ i counter/index in lines 12 and 19?"
391,2017-07-27T18:11:20.887605,Thelma,yeah that would just be a filter and I would add it to a list
391,2017-07-27T18:12:20.908189,Beula,"So is it working, or are you trying to make it faster/more efficient?"
391,2017-07-27T18:12:43.915936,Thelma,make it more efficient
391,2017-07-27T18:12:46.917207,Jed,"basically there are 3-5 files in each zipped folder: file_a, file_b, file_c, file_d

I wanted to make it so that the filename would increment, file_a_1, file_a_2, file_b_1, file_b_2"
391,2017-07-27T18:20:58.082451,Deedee,so there is a conflict w/ i here.
391,2017-07-27T18:22:37.114922,Deedee,"on line 12 you initialize it to 0.
on line 13, i takes values 0 to len(zip_ref.filelist)-1 (automatically incrementing it's value as f gets a new element value from zip_ref.filelist"
391,2017-07-27T18:24:32.152045,Deedee,"so list [""cat"", ""dog"", ""bird""]
i=0; f=cat
i=1; f=dog
i=2;f=bird"
391,2017-07-27T18:36:02.370819,Jed,ah makes sense didn’t notice it
391,2017-07-27T18:38:44.420175,Jed,getting a KeyError: “There is no item named “cat_0.csv” in the archive”
391,2017-07-27T18:47:47.581328,Deedee,"yeah. So basically what you are trying to do is change the name of the file inside the zip and then unzip, right?"
392,2017-07-27T16:44:32.551331,Jed,"Appreciate any help to point me to the right direction, not familiar with os class, how the files look like is in the comment :pray:"
392,2017-07-27T17:13:42.443181,Deedee,"`if f.filename in os.listdir(dir_name)`
Maybe?"
392,2017-07-27T17:43:30.232361,Jed,"Thanks! This is what I have so far, not working as I thought it would be, instead of file_a_1, file_a_2, file_b_1, file_b_2. It gives file_a_1, file_a_2, file_b_3, file_b_4"
393,2017-07-27T18:27:40.211472,Deedee,"just to be clear, this happens automatically when you `for i, f in enumerate(pet_list):`"
393,2017-07-27T19:08:14.937858,Deedee,"right. so what is happening is you are only updating the name of the list, now the name of the file, inside the zip, on the HD."
394,2017-07-27T18:59:30.785133,Jed,yeap!
394,2017-07-27T19:08:25.940916,Deedee,Check this out: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3982034/how-can-i-extract-files-using-custom-names-with-zipfile-module-from-python>
394,2017-07-27T19:08:55.949136,Deedee,looks like unziping to a tmp folder might be the way to go.
394,2017-07-27T19:12:00.999706,Deedee,"&gt; right. so what is happening is you are only updating the name of the list, now the name of the file, inside the zip, on the HD.
What I said here, is wrong. Zip file is one that is getting overwritten. NOT the files inside the zip."
394,2017-07-27T19:14:13.035286,Deedee,"so if there are existing files of `file_a`, it should create `file_a_0` and then `file_a_1`, and so on? It just keeps adding to file_a_watever-count and file_b_whatever-count, depending on the files that have already been extracted?"
394,2017-07-27T19:16:06.065457,Johana,anytime i open a file in pycharm it says loading … arggg. why does this happen when i have something really important to fix.
394,2017-07-27T19:24:27.194293,Jed,"file_a_0, file_a_1
or file_a, file_a_1
or file_a, file_a_0, file_a_1

are all acceptable!"
394,2017-07-27T19:30:08.282055,Deedee,yes... I saw that.
394,2017-07-27T19:30:14.283674,Deedee,"if f.filename in os.listdir(dir_name):

394,2017-07-27T20:18:51.985583,Deedee,"line 7 counts the number of files that start the same and end the same... this assumes that file_a_1, file_a_2... is sequential. If you get file_a_1, file_a_4, file_a_7 then just play w/ this. Also, had line 11 one indentation back so it was trying to unzip/extract file from previous iteration, that were the file not found error coming from"
394,2017-07-27T20:24:23.056539,Jed,hmm it still only opens the first 2 zipped folders and line 10 is giving me RunTimeError: Attempt to read ZIP archive that was already closed

394,2017-07-27T20:41:38.274201,Graciela,Essentially calling a function from another file doesn’t seem to work the same when you call it from inside another function

395,2017-07-27T20:42:47.288169,Graciela,Is there any reason why these two calls would act different?
395,2017-07-27T20:43:36.298169,Deedee,line 2 vs lines 4-6?
395,2017-07-27T20:44:22.307664,Deedee,lines 4 through 6 won't execute unless today_posts is called from somewhere.
395,2017-07-27T20:44:35.310338,Graciela,"Yeah, I get that :slightly_smiling_face:"
395,2017-07-27T20:44:39.311099,Deedee,ok
395,2017-07-27T20:44:55.314489,Graciela,"I’m calling the function, but the call on line 6 acts differently"
395,2017-07-27T20:45:04.316364,Graciela,Do you know much about the Telegram API wrapper telebot?
395,2017-07-27T20:46:33.334480,Deedee,"no, so I'll let it go for someone else."
395,2017-07-27T20:46:50.337895,Graciela,"Okay, thanks :slightly_smiling_face:"
395,2017-07-27T20:50:45.385557,Marcie,<@Graciela>: at a flance the only difference is that `db` and `c` are both scoped outside the context of the function so they could have different values each time it's called
395,2017-07-27T20:51:37.395855,Graciela,Hmmm okay
395,2017-07-27T20:52:11.402411,Graciela,Any reason the above wouldn’t work?
395,2017-07-27T20:54:58.434235,Graciela,"<@Marcie>, sorry to tag you :slightly_smiling_face:"
395,2017-07-27T20:55:29.440265,Marcie,"that looks legitimate, what behaviours are you seeing?"
395,2017-07-27T20:57:20.461859,Graciela,"Essentially the sql doesn’t execute, but the function is defo called, I’ve put print statements everywhere and they all execute"
395,2017-07-27T20:57:41.466106,Graciela,But if I move the sql statement out of the function and hard code args[0] then it all runs
395,2017-07-27T20:57:51.468135,Graciela,The function is called when the bot recieves a command on Telegram
395,2017-07-27T20:58:04.470673,Graciela,So the way the wrapper is coded is the only thing I can think of
395,2017-07-27T20:59:29.488097,Marcie,is the logic that creates the cursor `c` called each time the script runs?
395,2017-07-27T21:00:59.508413,Graciela,"db = sqlite3.connect(‘…’)
c = db.cursor()"

396,2017-07-27T23:28:49.151640,Wendolyn,"hi all, I am new (new to this slack and new to python) and have a question that is driving me crazy. could someone help?"
396,2017-07-27T23:29:57.162557,Beula,"Welcome <@Wendolyn> ! Go ahead and ask, someone will be along to help as they're available (no need to ask to ask)"
396,2017-07-27T23:30:58.172943,Wendolyn,"the short story is that I'm getting `[Errno 32] Broken pipe` and I tried to use this solution I found on stack overflow ```from signal import signal, SIGPIPE, SIG_DFL
signal(SIGPIPE,SIG_DFL) ``` but just as was warned in the comments, that made the error go away, but my service just shut down instead"
396,2017-07-27T23:32:07.184190,Wendolyn,"what I'm doing is this...I have two services, a main service for a website and a service for an api. My api gets some data from somewhere else and sends it to my website upon request."
396,2017-07-27T23:32:37.188972,Wendolyn,"when I hit the api directly, like through a valid route, I get the data and no error"
396,2017-07-27T23:33:28.196889,Wendolyn,"but when I go through my website, which will eventually generate the same url and send a request to my api, I get a broken pipe."
396,2017-07-27T23:33:41.198773,Wendolyn,both of the services are running on my computer
396,2017-07-27T23:34:24.205332,Wendolyn,"when I use the deployed version of the website (AWS), I get no error"
396,2017-07-27T23:34:33.206675,Wendolyn,only get broken pipe locally
396,2017-07-27T23:35:36.217419,Beula,Can you produce a minimum viable example? Say just the two services running and the web one asking from the service one and failing? Abstractly it sounds like the web process is closing the socket - but hard to know
396,2017-07-27T23:39:24.253355,Wendolyn,"ok...give me a minute to come up with an example, its actually pretty complicated. but I'll try to strip it down the the most important parts"
396,2017-07-27T23:42:46.285566,Tammi,None
396,2017-07-27T23:50:57.363211,Wendolyn,"I'm having a hard time distilling this into a code example. Maybe it would help me to just talk about it abstractly. If you don't mind? For one, what is a  socket, and what would cause it to close/how could I keep it open? I have a feeling that this is the problem"
396,2017-07-27T23:51:21.367026,Wendolyn,Thank you for your help
396,2017-07-27T23:55:01.402295,Wendolyn,reading about sockets here <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_networking.htm> right now. if you know of any good resources off the top of your head I would love to have them
396,2017-07-28T00:14:06.593470,Beula,"Sorry it's late my time, so I may be out shortly. I'm hoping someone else familiar with the architecture comes in to help too"
396,2017-07-28T00:21:28.664289,Wendolyn,"I understand, thanks anyway"
397,2017-07-28T02:06:48.687706,Latrina,hello people ..

397,2017-07-28T02:12:35.753312,Latrina,thanks <@Beula> . I surely will ask them in these dedicated channes.
397,2017-07-28T02:14:45.777497,Beula,No worries :slightly_smiling_face:
397,2017-07-28T02:16:15.795191,Beula,<@Latrina> did you follow the example from the docs (<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/examples/one_to_one/#>)
397,2017-07-28T02:16:48.801522,Beula,"Basically: 

```

400,2017-07-28T09:39:06.293500,Ray,hi guys. anyone here know any solutions to having a python script create a list of objects parallel to another script consuming those objects as they are created?
400,2017-07-28T09:45:22.491930,Ray,"i’ve got some test automation where each test requires a brand new account, but the accounts take anywhere between 30s-2min to create. i’d like to create the accounts parallel to the tests running to speed up execution time. i’ve found a way using `multiprocessing.Process` and continuously adding accounts to a `multiprocessing.Queue`, but this only works if that process is started from within the same script that executes the tests. i have a use case that requires the test execution to be able to consume a pre-made account as soon as the test starts executing, so `multiprocessing.Process` does not fully solve my problem, since the first test to execute still has to wait for the first account to be created and added to the queue"
400,2017-07-28T09:48:11.579488,Ray,"what would be ideal is a way to create a queue of accounts from a `create_accounts.py` script that i can execute at any time, and then be able to consume that queue at any arbitrary point in time _during_ or _after_ `create_accounts.py`"
400,2017-07-28T09:50:12.642411,Meg,an account takes up to two minutes to create?
400,2017-07-28T09:50:20.646906,Meg,:open_mouth:
400,2017-07-28T09:50:36.655169,Meg,no chance you can spend time trying to optimize that process?
400,2017-07-28T10:19:33.648591,Beula,"<@Ray> I wrote a service at a job with similar issues, it basically kept a fresh list of users at all times and tests could ""check one out"", later the service would clean them up"
400,2017-07-28T11:40:33.559933,Beula,This is why electron is so popular :(
401,2017-07-28T10:15:03.492713,Johnetta,"<@Suellen> That worked perfectly, thank you for the help!
```
#Change recipients string to list and strip whitespace.

402,2017-07-28T11:41:01.576781,Myong,Why did no one tell me of these other beautiful things
402,2017-07-28T11:41:19.587234,Myong,Attempting to run this damn progress bar is gonna be the end of me
402,2017-07-28T11:41:32.595450,Myong,honestly I'm just gonna say screw it and just click a button and you have to wait
402,2017-07-28T11:41:47.604046,Beula,What's the app do?
402,2017-07-28T11:41:51.606699,Denna,tkinter is the mistake here :smile:
402,2017-07-28T11:41:53.607332,Myong,Just generates a report
402,2017-07-28T11:41:55.609084,Ray,"<@Meg> I would love to optimize the that process, but we’re working with a huge legacy app and optimizing the app itself is not really a feasible option without reliable (and efficient) test automation :disappointed:"

402,2017-07-28T11:42:22.624787,Myong,it looks horrible
402,2017-07-28T11:42:43.637309,Ray,<@Beula> that sounds like what i’m looking for. how did you go about that?
402,2017-07-28T11:43:02.648476,Meg,"<@Ray> makes sense, gotta work with what you have."
402,2017-07-28T11:43:29.664527,Ray,exactly
402,2017-07-28T11:45:25.734027,Beula,"It was just a webapp, it would have a pool size of users it had to maintain, each time a test asked for a user I'd mark them as checked out and add them to a cleanup queue. That had a default time to live, but a test could ask for longer."
402,2017-07-28T11:45:43.744235,Beula,"Then the test could edit the user if they wanted, add roles, etc"
402,2017-07-28T11:46:19.765701,Beula,"Our tests ran constantly and tons of them, so this was a Go application due to the load"
402,2017-07-28T11:47:06.794213,Meg,but not create user?
402,2017-07-28T11:48:45.851498,Beula,What?
402,2017-07-28T11:50:10.900937,Ray,ah ok
402,2017-07-28T11:51:20.941785,Beula,"It's not ideal to depend on an external service for tests, this was for the staging env"
402,2017-07-28T11:51:41.953967,Ray,agreed. this is also for our staging env
402,2017-07-28T11:53:04.002099,Ray,"i don’t envision the service being used outside of the tests, but i do need it to be able to be run independently of running the tests themselves"
402,2017-07-28T11:53:29.017174,Beula,I ended up getting an offer to move to Dev after that 
402,2017-07-28T11:53:41.024613,Ray,oh yeah?
402,2017-07-28T11:53:42.025140,Ray,nice
402,2017-07-28T11:54:19.046912,Ray,"we’re a mostly php shop, but atm all our test automation is in python, for whatever reason (not that i’m complaining. i like python better :smile:)"
402,2017-07-28T11:54:51.065911,Beula,I've considered going back to qa to be able to do Python full time again

403,2017-07-28T12:35:41.410444,Myong,do you have any other recommendation?
403,2017-07-28T12:35:51.415709,Beula,Are you using any 3.6 features?
403,2017-07-28T12:36:00.420557,Myong,That's what I was gonna figure out
403,2017-07-28T12:36:03.422002,Myong,I will say no
403,2017-07-28T12:36:07.423833,Myong,because I probably am not

403,2017-07-28T12:37:59.481078,Beula,"Yeah, I have used it with 3.5 for about a year"
403,2017-07-28T13:01:30.219358,Signe,<@Myong> why not `pyenv`?
403,2017-07-28T13:02:35.254358,Signe,oh.. right &gt;.&lt;
403,2017-07-28T13:02:37.255758,Signe,ignore me...
403,2017-07-28T13:04:50.324431,Beula,But do use `pyenv` to handle multiple versions!

403,2017-07-28T13:08:53.449749,Myong,<@Beula> should I just make up another `virtualenv` and put 3.5.whayeber on it then install reqs?
403,2017-07-28T13:08:58.452134,Johana,was it postgres? i had an issue and fixed it by upgrading psycopg2.
403,2017-07-28T13:09:12.459189,Beula,"Just `brew` managing my python install. For example when 3.6.2 came out and I updated, it killed a bunch of virtualenvs that were looking at the 3.6.1 executable"

403,2017-07-28T13:09:47.477410,Johana,yea i use pyenv now for that. the psycopg2 thing is the only issue i’ve had so far.

405,2017-07-28T13:48:44.699177,Clarence,I figured that there is a relation between the dumped data from multiple .txts which would immediately push me to use Psql but I wonder if Mongo can perform fairly if I am able to handle the co-relation at the app level with decent db-search
405,2017-07-28T13:49:28.722503,Meg,I’d do postgres

405,2017-07-28T13:53:01.835422,Myong,yay no errors after 2 seconds this time
405,2017-07-28T13:53:54.864055,Myong,"uh oh, the `.exe`just exits"
405,2017-07-28T13:53:57.865535,Myong,yay
405,2017-07-28T13:54:13.873824,Beula,You may need a special flag for a UI based app
405,2017-07-28T13:54:29.882847,Myong,gotcha
405,2017-07-28T13:54:33.885422,Myong,bunch of missing modules also
405,2017-07-28T14:02:56.157131,Myong,Seems like the main error are two of my module missing due to `invalid module`
405,2017-07-28T14:10:36.400102,Myong,Okay so inspecting the archive of my imported modules it does seem that I do not have the two modules
405,2017-07-28T14:27:08.918167,Myong,Im quite lost here. There's not much documentation on how to force a module import
405,2017-07-28T14:27:18.923818,Myong,And I can't figure out why the two modules are invalid
405,2017-07-28T14:46:02.513735,Myong,"I get a bunch of `Missing Module` warning s, but only two `Invalid Module` warnings for two of my modules imported in `main.py` and I'm not sure why they're invalid"
406,2017-07-28T14:45:15.488497,Suellen,is this pyinstaller-related?
406,2017-07-28T14:45:25.494299,Myong,Yes
406,2017-07-28T14:46:05.515359,Myong,I've renamed them
406,2017-07-28T14:49:08.612839,Suellen,"oh, I've never seen an invalid module thing"
406,2017-07-28T14:49:49.634486,Suellen,but for missing modules there's a `hidden_imports` directive
406,2017-07-28T14:50:11.646059,Suellen,pyinstaller isn't very good at detecting what modules are used by a program :confused:
406,2017-07-28T14:54:26.777442,Myong,I've even got it as a hidden import
406,2017-07-28T14:54:37.782950,Myong,Yeah I have no clue what the invalid module is
406,2017-07-28T14:54:43.786122,Myong,There is nothing about it
406,2017-07-28T14:54:47.788117,Myong,I can't find anything online
406,2017-07-28T14:55:32.811292,Suellen,What's the module in question?
406,2017-07-28T14:56:20.835686,Myong,"Two modules, one uses `openpyxl` and populates an excel workbook with some data, another is just a single popup window for a notification that the file has finished being generated"
406,2017-07-28T14:57:58.886577,Suellen,"oh damn, openpyxl"
406,2017-07-28T14:58:06.890710,Myong,Is that why?
406,2017-07-28T14:58:11.893256,Suellen,"yeah, I spent a couple of hours fighting it"
406,2017-07-28T14:58:16.895902,Myong,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
406,2017-07-28T14:58:48.913071,Suellen,"wait, does it compile OK and then the program doesn't work, or it doesn't compile altogether?"
406,2017-07-28T14:59:26.932567,Suellen,don't lose hope just yet :slightly_smiling_face:
406,2017-07-28T14:59:28.933261,Myong,"Like the raw code? It all works, but of course without those two modules, or at least the openpyxl module it wont"
406,2017-07-28T14:59:37.938300,Myong,Im gonna comment them out
406,2017-07-28T14:59:44.941612,Myong,only two lines in my project
406,2017-07-28T14:59:46.942833,Myong,and see what happens
406,2017-07-28T15:00:36.970589,Myong,building it now in pyinstaller
406,2017-07-28T15:02:03.014018,Myong,"won't even run at all actually, just opens and closes"
406,2017-07-28T15:02:31.028410,Suellen,run it from cmd.exe to see the error
406,2017-07-28T15:02:38.031745,Myong,okay
406,2017-07-28T15:05:59.132162,Myong,`Error loading Python DLL: C:\...\main\python35.dll`

406,2017-07-28T15:07:28.175455,Myong,oh wait was it this
406,2017-07-28T15:07:33.177298,Myong,Cause I saw something about this earlier
406,2017-07-28T15:07:42.182130,Myong,`_MEIPASS2 is NULL`
406,2017-07-28T15:08:18.199802,Suellen,I remember there was some entity called `_MEIPASS2` but I didn't mess with it at all

406,2017-07-28T15:21:32.573689,Myong,I believe it's for `--onefile` flag
406,2017-07-28T15:21:47.580606,Myong,let me link to my python dir in `pathex`...
406,2017-07-28T15:24:01.642014,Myong,It's trying to pull python 3.5 dll from my build directory.
406,2017-07-28T15:37:46.027088,Myong,<@Suellen> should the python35.dll be in that build directory?
406,2017-07-28T15:42:39.159484,Myong,why is my specfile being overwritten every single time
406,2017-07-28T15:46:24.259666,Suellen,there should be a single exe file
406,2017-07-28T15:56:48.542033,Myong,I'm just trying to point the .exe to find the python35.dll
406,2017-07-28T15:56:57.546361,Myong,But everything I am doing isn't working
406,2017-07-28T15:59:59.628877,Myong,"Well, may have found my problem"
406,2017-07-28T16:02:33.701704,Myong,Does anyone have any clue why Pyinstaller chooses to overwrite my specfile every time I save it then run again
406,2017-07-28T16:19:51.158371,Myong,"`binaries=[('C:\\Users\\kybowman\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python35\\python35.dll', 'python35.dll')],`"
407,2017-07-28T15:19:03.503778,Suellen,why is this needed at all? :confused:
408,2017-07-28T15:25:22.680268,Susie,thank you <@Johana>
409,2017-07-28T16:14:15.011467,Suellen,the specfile is generated for you to edit and use instead of passing parameters to pyinstaller
409,2017-07-28T16:14:25.016065,Meghan,It creates a spec unless you run it from a spec.
409,2017-07-28T16:14:32.019031,Suellen,i.e. you create a spec and then do `pyinstaller main.spec`
409,2017-07-28T16:14:39.021935,Meghan,Instead of specifying the .py file specify .spec
409,2017-07-28T16:17:57.109172,Myong,gotcha
409,2017-07-28T16:19:29.148893,Myong,Trying to add `python35.dll` to the dir
409,2017-07-28T16:19:32.150277,Myong,no luck
409,2017-07-28T16:23:35.256037,Myong,Just another one of those days
409,2017-07-28T16:24:14.273899,Meghan,Why would you need to do that? I didn't have to do anything along those lines to distribute Windows compiled scripts.
409,2017-07-28T16:24:58.293181,Myong,I have absolutely no clue
409,2017-07-28T16:25:29.307126,Myong,Not sure what else needs to go in there to not get missing Python35.dll
409,2017-07-28T16:25:48.315545,Myong,The dll is literally in there with the `.exe` and it's attempting to pull it from somewhere else
409,2017-07-28T16:29:29.411998,Myong,Found a google group post regarding `vcredist`
409,2017-07-28T16:33:23.516553,Meghan,Are you compiling on Windows?
409,2017-07-28T16:34:15.539001,Myong,Yeah
409,2017-07-28T16:35:00.558492,Myong,I'm still wondering about the MEI thing because what happens is when I run it it says the DLL can't be found in c:/.../temp/pyinstaller/_MEIxxxx/python35.dll
409,2017-07-28T16:43:26.773393,Myong,No I am not at all
409,2017-07-28T16:43:30.775368,Myong,I have no clue where it gets that path from
409,2017-07-28T16:43:38.778360,Meghan,pyinstaller with the onefile flag should really be including that with it.
409,2017-07-28T16:43:46.782152,Meghan,That path is where your files are extracted to.
409,2017-07-28T16:44:34.802181,Meghan,"```
def resource_path(relative_path):
    """""" Get absolute path to resource, works for dev and for PyInstaller
     This is used to find included data files in pyinstaller version
    pyinstaller makes an environment variable? that has path to the included data files

    """"""

    if hasattr(sys, '_MEIPASS'):
        return os.path.join(sys._MEIPASS, relative_path)

    return os.path.join(os.path.abspath("".""), relative_path)
```

This is what I've used to access included files, such as textfsm templates."
409,2017-07-28T16:44:52.810172,Myong,Where should this go?
409,2017-07-28T16:44:59.812721,Myong,Top of main file?
409,2017-07-28T16:45:08.816976,Myong,Or hook
409,2017-07-28T16:45:27.825146,Meghan,"No, you use that in your open lines."
409,2017-07-28T16:45:50.834879,Meghan,"Example:
```
        with open(resource_path('templates/jinja2/evc-map.jinja')) as f:
            template = f.read()
            jinja = Template(template)
```"
409,2017-07-28T16:46:08.842290,Meghan,"But, with your missing dll, something else is going wrong."
409,2017-07-28T16:46:34.853541,Meghan,Have you tried to compile something simple to see if that works?
409,2017-07-28T16:47:33.878635,Myong,Yes I'm using a simple helloworld.py script it works fine
409,2017-07-28T16:49:55.937523,Meghan,"That's really weird. The only issues I ran into with pyinstaller were that it wasn't ready for 3.6 and I had to use the dev version, and with one of my tools for some reason it couldn't figure out the imports so I had to manually specify every single import."
409,2017-07-28T16:50:06.941895,Myong,Yeah I had to downgrade to 3.5.3
409,2017-07-28T16:51:44.981941,Myong,"Okay so given the code to grab the _MEIPASS envar, where exactly do I need to be putting the code within open lines"
409,2017-07-28T16:52:32.001479,Meghan,The function I gave you is if you need to open an included file. For example if you have templates or html you include in the package.
409,2017-07-28T16:52:49.007756,Meghan,"You can't use that for the python dll, because nothing is going to happen without that dll."
409,2017-07-28T16:53:48.031647,Myong,Yeah makes sense. But I just dont get this error at all. I've found so many posts on it in 2 hours and I'm just lost
409,2017-07-28T16:54:10.040532,Meghan,How do you have pyinstaller installed?
409,2017-07-28T16:54:23.046326,Myong,through pip
409,2017-07-28T16:54:56.060414,Meghan,In a virtual environment?
409,2017-07-28T16:55:25.072428,Myong,Yes
409,2017-07-28T16:56:27.098730,Meghan,"Well, you could make a short script that prints the location of the MEIPASS directory then pauses for input, then go there and see what is extracted. I don't know if it extracts the dll file and libraries there or not though."
409,2017-07-28T16:57:59.137878,Myong,something like print(sys.MEIPASS)
409,2017-07-28T17:07:08.369485,Myong,oh man i might have got it. closing my eyes one sec
409,2017-07-28T17:07:28.378084,Myong,NOPE. sweet

414,2017-07-29T12:17:44.246222,Gregory,"I'm trying to extend the User model and have that incorporated into Django Admin. For example add a phone number. I added this to models:
`models.py`
```
class UserProfile(AbstractUser):
	phone = models.CharField(max_length=40, unique=True)

	REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['phone']
```

and in `setting.py`
```
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'MyApp.UserProfile'
```
but I'm getting the error `django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: AUTH_USER_MODEL refers to model 'MyApp.UserProfile' that has not been installed`

Anyone know what I'm doing wrong, here?"
414,2017-07-29T13:47:36.718142,Denna,<@Gregory> is related app added to INSTALLED_APPS?
414,2017-07-29T14:03:35.801834,Deedee,<@Gregory> Try <#C0LMFRMB5|django> or <#C0W0D17MJ|django_learning> channels. There are some really seasoned Django devs in there. Just share your question into one of those 2 and sit back and wait for the magic to happen.
414,2017-07-29T14:05:17.811022,Beula,"<@Gregory> I believe <@Denna> is correct, double check that the new app is listed in your `INSTALLED_APPS` - if that isn't it, come join us in <#C0LMFRMB5|django>"
415,2017-07-29T12:29:46.309330,Deedee,<@Susanne> are you using 2.7 or 3.x?
416,2017-07-29T14:31:14.943753,Susanne,Name? 
416,2017-07-29T14:55:55.067303,Denny,"name is a built-in that is defined by the python interpreter (I'm jumping in late, but I think that's what you had asked)"
416,2017-07-29T14:57:10.073288,Deedee,:point_up:
417,2017-07-29T16:01:49.383749,Susanne,Well I just sent you the relevant code for the problem
417,2017-07-29T16:01:56.384283,Susanne,I was having
417,2017-07-29T16:06:29.405728,Deedee,"lines 145 and 148 (and I'm sure others in the code you didn't post) call main(). Are you also calling main() at the bottom near/next to menu()? No, right? Otherwise you'd get dup menu()."
417,2017-07-29T16:08:09.414093,Deedee,"so try `if __name__ ....` to call `main()`.
and use `main()` to start you off and maintain control of flow/logic, and when to quit."
417,2017-07-29T16:19:58.468932,Susanne,Ok I'll try that
417,2017-07-29T16:30:55.517659,Deedee,"<@Susanne> This is just an example of how I've done this in the past <https://github.com/khdc-me/PracticePython_org/blob/master/Exercise032.py>
NOTE: There are a lot of things that I would change if I had to redo this game, but it can serve as a basic guide for what you are trying to do. Again, don't follow this outright, but use it for ideas."
417,2017-07-29T17:48:13.844812,Susanne,so youre saying get rid of the main()‘s and just slap a if __name__ ==  “__main__” on the bottom?
417,2017-07-29T17:51:13.856278,Deedee,no. scroll up to 11:30am. and read my reply to your previous msg
417,2017-07-29T17:57:56.882326,Deedee,Also read this
417,2017-07-29T18:52:56.090628,Susanne,Here is the revised code
417,2017-07-29T18:54:35.096809,Susanne,<@Deedee>
417,2017-07-29T18:55:38.100755,Deedee,remove line 167
417,2017-07-29T18:56:46.104892,Deedee,did you look at the link I sent you to the 'example'?
417,2017-07-29T18:57:33.107835,Susanne,Yes I did? so how are you able to call main then?
417,2017-07-29T18:57:44.108488,Deedee,it just does.
417,2017-07-29T18:58:04.109712,Deedee,"so this way, main() runs if this is run as a script... a stand-alone script."
417,2017-07-29T18:59:10.113976,Deedee,"like, you create a hello world and run it from terminal by `python helloworld.py`
```
def main():
    print ""Hello World""

if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
```"
417,2017-07-29T18:59:50.116479,Susanne,but I dont have scripts on my function Im using that function to call functions
417,2017-07-29T19:00:08.118183,Susanne,but in raelity main is kinda of a useless function tbh
417,2017-07-29T19:02:11.127652,Susanne,would you suggest getting rid of hte main functino?
417,2017-07-29T19:04:53.138195,Deedee,no
417,2017-07-29T19:07:13.147538,Deedee,"find a way to make it work, not just w/ the `main()` function, but through it."
417,2017-07-29T19:10:43.160330,Susanne,yea its not working ill just stick to calling the main function normally
417,2017-07-29T19:16:20.181088,Susanne,I really do not how you’re running it and its working? lol
417,2017-07-29T19:17:11.184329,Deedee,careful. Keep it civil. This IS 'calling the main function normally'
417,2017-07-29T19:17:45.186345,Deedee,I literally just copied and pasted your most recent code and ran it.
417,2017-07-29T19:18:45.190027,Deedee,You're close. And having it all segmented into various functions is will make it very easy for you to make the small tweaks that it needs.
417,2017-07-29T19:19:03.191065,Deedee,Stare at it... fight with it. It'll click.
417,2017-07-29T19:19:33.192858,Susanne,Are you sure you are using the code I just posted on here?
417,2017-07-29T19:19:49.193745,Susanne,30 mins ago?
417,2017-07-29T19:20:05.194726,Susanne,cuz idk man it aint clicking
417,2017-07-29T19:22:31.204007,Deedee,"And I only did it to see if it would run, and if not... see what errors it produced. &lt;-- in fact, when you run it, what errors do you get?"
417,2017-07-29T19:23:28.207439,Susanne,It doesnt even run I get nothing
417,2017-07-29T19:24:35.211959,Susanne,I run and then it stops
417,2017-07-29T19:24:37.212098,Deedee,"yeah, well I was asked a username and password and all"
417,2017-07-29T19:24:49.212963,Susanne,I wasn’t at all
417,2017-07-29T19:25:00.213614,Deedee,had to type that in then type it in again before it produced that main menu
417,2017-07-29T19:25:20.215026,Susanne,maybe <http://repl.it|repl.it> doesn’t run if __name statement
417,2017-07-29T19:32:50.243514,Deedee,"hahaha maybe. I can't confirm or deny. But if it doesn't work, then so be it... change 158 and 159 to just call main(). And ask someone why it doesn't work the way we're talking about here. Now, back to your original question... It's obvious that lines 50 and 51 are not the correct spots to declare the lists. Did you look into passing lists to functions?"
417,2017-07-29T19:36:13.255470,Susanne,No I haven't
417,2017-07-29T19:39:17.266077,Susanne,Well I believe i have been this entire time
417,2017-07-29T19:39:55.268113,Susanne,Where would you recommend calling the lists?
417,2017-07-29T19:45:06.286355,Deedee,"where do you think it should go? step through what you have, carefully. Did you write this out on paper first?"
417,2017-07-29T19:47:54.296459,Susanne,No I didn't 
417,2017-07-29T19:48:22.298293,Susanne,I was thinking about putting it after menu but before the books function and then returning those values
417,2017-07-29T19:49:52.303311,Susanne,That's pretty much the one problem I've been having this whole time lol
417,2017-07-29T19:55:17.322615,Deedee,no. that's the only thing you asked about. There are multiple probs :joy:
417,2017-07-29T19:55:37.323756,Deedee,"like, line 129, type 'one' instead of '1'"
417,2017-07-29T19:56:17.326339,Deedee,lines 12 and 13 in register() don't make sense.
417,2017-07-29T19:56:25.326840,Deedee,and much more. but one thing at a time.
417,2017-07-29T19:56:55.328535,Susanne,Well 129 is just a print statement
417,2017-07-29T19:57:09.329465,Susanne,So I can make it a little more clear if anything
417,2017-07-29T19:57:23.330278,Deedee,109*
417,2017-07-29T19:58:29.334320,Susanne,Again it's still a print statement
417,2017-07-29T19:58:45.335269,Susanne,I'm deleting the list item by the index
417,2017-07-29T19:59:03.336437,Deedee,"Line 109 says: `num = int(input(""Which book would you like to find?""))`"
417,2017-07-29T19:59:26.337912,Deedee,"Line 129 says `num = int(input(""Which book would you like to sell?""))`"
417,2017-07-29T19:59:36.338475,Deedee,"that's user input, not a print statement."
417,2017-07-29T20:02:42.351498,Susanne,Oh my bad
417,2017-07-29T20:03:20.353741,Susanne,Well that would work
417,2017-07-29T20:03:52.355714,Deedee,"Lines 52 and 53:
```
  for i in range(0, len(inventory)):
    print(inventory[i])
```
should be
```
for i in inventory:
    print(inventory)
```
but `i` should be more describptive, like `movie_title` or whatever."
417,2017-07-29T20:05:24.361301,Deedee,anyway... let's look at where you said you'd post the list
417,2017-07-29T20:07:00.366863,Deedee,"&gt;  after menu but before the books function and then returning those values
What would that look like?"
417,2017-07-29T20:08:52.373653,Deedee,"Since you mention 'returning values', how does register and login work? In your own words."
417,2017-07-29T20:38:55.477931,Deedee,how do you see that code happening? can you type it up here?
417,2017-07-29T20:49:43.514136,Deedee,okay.. so I asked about this b/c that's not how `return` works
417,2017-07-29T20:51:15.519377,Deedee,"let's start building this bad boy.
I'm guessing the first step is that the user has to register, right?"
417,2017-07-29T20:51:47.520979,Deedee,so we'll start w/
417,2017-07-29T20:52:52.524387,Deedee,we'll move this into comments under that code snipet
418,2017-07-29T20:37:06.472072,Susanne,It would allow me to use this values into another function when I call a specific using the return values as parameters
418,2017-07-29T20:51:24.519904,Susanne,yea
418,2017-07-29T20:51:37.520566,Susanne,they create a username and a password
418,2017-07-29T20:51:48.521030,Susanne,the password has to be 6 characters or more
418,2017-07-29T21:31:45.664980,Susanne,I need a register and login
418,2017-07-29T21:40:07.694276,Susanne,"Ok and I'm assuming we'll use it in a little bit, right?"
418,2017-07-29T21:50:28.730308,Susanne,ok
418,2017-07-29T21:50:45.731157,Susanne,Im just trying to figure out which extensions to download for sublime
418,2017-07-29T22:05:50.786499,Susanne,<@Deedee> You wanna move this over to the dm?
418,2017-07-30T10:26:54.239476,Susanne,how to do you access the key of a specific dictionary?
418,2017-07-30T10:27:52.243481,Susanne,how do you*
418,2017-07-30T10:28:22.245703,Beula,<@Susanne> Can you show what you're trying to get data out of? Normally it's just `dictionary['key_to_get']` to get the value out
418,2017-07-30T10:29:01.248356,Beula,There's also the view method if you want to see the available keys: `dictionary.keys()`
418,2017-07-30T10:31:20.259171,Beula,Is it line 5 and you are trying to check if the input value is in the books dictionary?
418,2017-07-30T10:32:05.262692,Beula,"First, be sure to not override built-ins (`while str not in`, `str` is a built in). I also believe that you want `i` instead of `str` there"
418,2017-07-30T10:32:36.265100,Beula,"But you can just check `if key in dict: print('Yay, it exists!')`"
418,2017-07-30T10:34:29.273977,Susanne,but i isn’t going to print out
418,2017-07-30T10:36:29.282915,Susanne,"I ran the for loop but when I go to select I, I get ‘dict_items’ object cannot be interpreted as an integer"
418,2017-07-30T10:39:01.293643,Beula,"Oh, yeah you can't use integers in a dict - you are asking the user to give you an int and then looking that up in the dict"
418,2017-07-30T10:39:18.294982,Beula,"If you want to do that, you need to keep track of what keys the integers correlate with"
418,2017-07-30T10:39:51.297261,Susanne,Thats im trying to do by converting it into a tuple
418,2017-07-30T10:40:04.298296,Susanne,but i guess that doesnt work
418,2017-07-30T10:40:57.302534,Beula,"Dictionaries don't keep order until python 3.6, just an FYI - so that could work if you save it to a variable first, then ask for input"
418,2017-07-30T10:42:03.307069,Beula,"So maybe something like: 

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; options = list(enumerate(d.items()))
&gt;&gt;&gt; options
[(0, ('Game of Thrones', 50.0))]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i, (k, v) in options:
...   print(""select"", i,"" for "", k)
...
select 0  for  Game of Thrones
&gt;&gt;&gt; options[0]
(0, ('Game of Thrones', 50.0))
```"
418,2017-07-30T10:44:09.316320,Beula,"Actually in that case, probably better to just do `options = list(d.items())` which will give you a list of tuples, then from there the `i` value is the array index"
418,2017-07-30T10:46:41.327203,Susanne,‘float’ object is not iterable
418,2017-07-30T10:46:46.327571,Susanne,that was the error I got
418,2017-07-30T10:51:14.347653,Beula,Looking <@Susanne>
418,2017-07-30T10:51:18.347949,Beula,just a minute
418,2017-07-30T10:51:19.348030,Susanne,ok
418,2017-07-30T10:53:07.356179,Beula,What line is the error in the stacktrace <@Susanne>
418,2017-07-30T10:58:06.378279,Beula,`enumerate(options)`
418,2017-07-30T10:58:08.378347,Beula,sorry
418,2017-07-30T10:59:43.386000,Susanne,ok then what would I put if I wanted to print out he key and value?
418,2017-07-30T11:00:12.389009,Beula,How about you tell me on that one :slightly_smiling_face: Try it a bit and then report back if you are stuck
418,2017-07-30T11:00:31.390909,Beula,I don't want to give you too many answers to prohibit you learning it :slightly_smiling_face:
418,2017-07-30T11:00:36.391411,Susanne,I would continue using options correct?
418,2017-07-30T11:01:30.396097,Beula,Yep
418,2017-07-30T11:08:06.428903,Beula,"You can grab it from options, which is a list of tuples `[(key, value)] -&gt; [(""Movie Name"", float_val)]`"
418,2017-07-30T11:08:21.430276,Beula,So `options[i][0]` and `options[i][1]`
418,2017-07-30T11:09:17.434719,Susanne,"It says “list indices must be integers or slices, not str”"
418,2017-07-30T11:09:57.437748,Susanne,thats the snippet I ran
418,2017-07-30T11:10:35.441100,Beula,The question you need to ask yourself is which thing in that snippet can give you a string that is used in `options`?
418,2017-07-30T11:11:08.443686,Susanne,the str function
418,2017-07-30T11:11:17.444371,Beula,You aren't using the `str` function
418,2017-07-30T11:11:29.445338,Beula,The issue is that you are passing a `str` as an index
418,2017-07-30T11:11:48.446596,Susanne,can you use int?
418,2017-07-30T11:12:09.448170,Beula,That's what you want to use in a list :slightly_smiling_face:
418,2017-07-30T11:12:18.448852,Beula,Check this doc on `input` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input>
418,2017-07-30T11:12:44.450688,Beula,"&gt; The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string"
418,2017-07-30T11:15:45.464749,Susanne,ok
418,2017-07-30T11:15:58.465891,Susanne,Now how would validate the input?
418,2017-07-30T11:16:24.467824,Susanne,at least what would be the thing I am looking for in the while statement?
418,2017-07-30T11:17:18.472247,Beula,"I'll leave that to you for a little to try out, let me know if you hit your head on it too long"
418,2017-07-30T11:17:59.475252,Susanne,hint at least? pretty please with sprinkles on top :smile:
418,2017-07-30T11:27:59.523512,Beula,"You have a list of things, you need to make sure the input is in that list :wink:"
418,2017-07-30T11:28:25.525587,Susanne,while i not in range(options)?
418,2017-07-30T11:29:30.530833,Beula,Test it out
418,2017-07-30T11:29:47.532134,Beula,the nice thing about programming is you can test theories pretty easily :smile:
418,2017-07-30T11:29:55.532759,Susanne,that is true
418,2017-07-30T11:32:30.546729,Susanne,I got this “‘list’ object cannot be interpreted as an integer”
418,2017-07-30T11:36:37.567250,Beula,And which thing in that is a `list`?
418,2017-07-30T11:39:40.582156,Gregory,"<@Denna> <@Beula> (sorry for the days-late response). Yes. My app is in installed apps and the admin panel is fully accessible and usable, but with the generic user model"
418,2017-07-30T11:39:57.583370,Susanne,the options
418,2017-07-30T11:41:22.590399,Susanne,correct?
418,2017-07-30T14:17:55.365592,Susanne,right I got it figured out
418,2017-07-30T14:49:20.528261,Susanne,"When I run the menu
I enter my command do the selected function
Function goes through and what I need it to do 
then when I return it takes me back to the menu
when I enter a command to do another function it stops
why does it do that?"

418,2017-07-31T12:01:17.672914,Myong,What is the best way to have a function run in code when referencing an object that will not have been initialized at build time?
418,2017-07-31T12:01:39.687762,Beula,"<@Myong> - build time? What is this, Java?"
418,2017-07-31T12:02:16.711850,Beula,"JK of course, can you clarify a little?"
418,2017-07-31T12:02:39.726767,Myong,im all over the place lmao
418,2017-07-31T12:02:55.736751,Myong,So basically similar to what I was asking a few days ago regarding doing some lambda stuff
418,2017-07-31T12:03:03.740992,Beula,Ah
418,2017-07-31T12:03:05.742219,Myong,I have a config file where
418,2017-07-31T12:03:15.749112,Myong,I update the settings as a user enters their choices
418,2017-07-31T12:03:32.759907,Myong,"And in one part I have 3 separate lists a user can choose from, but the way they choose the list is by the title of the list"
418,2017-07-31T12:03:46.769153,Myong,"then in tkinter on the next screen, the appropriate list shows up"
418,2017-07-31T12:04:09.783683,Myong,"However, in tkinter since it builds each frame before it runs, it doesn't get filled with the user selection"
418,2017-07-31T12:04:50.809407,Myong,and it doesn't like that I want to wait for user input before filling up a `OptionMenu`
418,2017-07-31T12:05:22.829301,Myong,"so I was thinking that on submit of the screen before, I could simply access the next Frame before it appears, clear the list, and populate it with the correct values"
418,2017-07-31T12:05:30.833728,Myong,But I wasn't sure if there was a less annoying walk around?
418,2017-07-31T12:06:04.854401,Gabriele,Sounds like you need to wait to build the GUI until after the input has happened
418,2017-07-31T12:06:56.886125,Myong,"Well if that were the case, in tkinter I would need multiple mainloops because all the Frames in a single mainloop are built before any single Frame shows to a user"
418,2017-07-31T12:07:06.892176,Myong,And multiple mainloops means multiple screens
418,2017-07-31T12:07:25.903397,Myong,"Guess I just chose a crappy GUI framework to begin with, compared to the rest at least..."
418,2017-07-31T12:07:31.907373,Myong,I'll go ahead with the manual option
418,2017-07-31T12:08:58.960090,Gabriele,"You probably need to change the UI from within an event, called from the main loop"
418,2017-07-31T12:09:15.970490,Gabriele,"But yeah, tkinter is not exactly 21st century stuff"
418,2017-07-31T12:11:13.040576,Myong,"Yup, good times with the 1900s, good times"

420,2017-07-30T09:12:57.919649,Beula,"<@Fern> what makes you think they can't ""contain a restful resource""? Aiohttp is lower level framework, but you can design it any way you please "

421,2017-07-30T13:28:54.119951,Beula,"<@Dennis> What's your programming experience level? Are you fully new to programming, or know another language?"
421,2017-07-30T13:51:03.229052,Beula,"Because `i` is set to the last index in the loop because python has function scoping, meaning that any variable defined within the function body (even nested scopes) will be available in the function.

It appears you need to use `num` rather than `i` to get the value from options"
421,2017-07-30T15:45:08.816312,Dennis,"<@Beula> I Learned ""C"" language, And have good experience in it."
421,2017-07-30T16:38:36.073250,Beula,"I think being here and asking questions in <#C07EW4DNE|learning_python> is a good start, probably just writing some applications and the like will get you up to speed if you know programming already <@Dennis>"

424,2017-07-31T13:17:32.322066,Myong,I was about to try that
424,2017-07-31T13:17:43.328164,Beula,I just remember returning my windows box within a day after trying to get C-libs to build on windows
424,2017-07-31T13:17:56.335440,Beula,"apparently the anaconda distribution really helps on windows though, it may be worth looking into"
424,2017-07-31T13:19:23.384880,Myong,Yeah it's horrible honestly
424,2017-07-31T13:19:43.396036,Beula,have you tried WSL yet?
424,2017-07-31T13:20:13.413055,Myong,"I have not actually, I have ubuntu on my surface pro, but that's a pain in my ass"

425,2017-07-31T13:55:29.636262,Zaida,My work team and I use it for team-wide reminders.
425,2017-07-31T13:57:19.702035,Tandra,slackbot can be useful i guess
425,2017-07-31T13:57:37.712779,Zaida,Is that giving back the profile info? Or info that you have given slackbot?
425,2017-07-31T13:57:59.726052,Tandra,info given to slackbot
425,2017-07-31T13:59:53.795773,Beula,"Yeah, reminders are the big one for me"
425,2017-07-31T14:00:39.826347,Ciera,only use it for reminders
425,2017-07-31T14:03:29.929274,Beula,"Though really that is the slack app, slackbot is just the deliverer of the message since it's slash commands"
426,2017-07-31T15:01:22.954192,Myong,Hey <@Beula> what's a good substitution for the `f'{datetime.datetime.now():%Y-%m-%d}.xlsx'` formatting
426,2017-07-31T15:01:29.957904,Myong,Can't use it in 3.6
426,2017-07-31T15:02:05.979532,Beula,"`""{:%Y-%m-%d}.xlsx"".format(datetime.datetime.now())` I think"
426,2017-07-31T15:02:07.980898,Beula,let me double check
426,2017-07-31T15:02:41.000856,Beula,"```
Python 3.6.2 (default, Jul 17 2017, 16:44:45)

&gt;&gt;&gt; import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; ""{:%Y-%m-%d}.xlsx"".format(datetime.datetime.now())
'2017-07-31.xlsx'
```

That's 3.6.2 but should be backwards compatible"
426,2017-07-31T15:04:01.046137,Myong,Okay cool
426,2017-07-31T15:04:06.049009,Myong,"Also, another quick question"
426,2017-07-31T15:04:18.055714,Myong,Was working with a bunch of dictionaries all parts of `tkinter` for different object
426,2017-07-31T15:04:31.062614,Myong,On my computer some keys were shown as `!branches` or likewise
426,2017-07-31T15:04:38.066773,Myong,denoted as a string with `!` prepended
426,2017-07-31T15:04:54.075224,Myong,but on a coworkers computer in some cases the keys were completely random numeric strings
426,2017-07-31T15:05:04.080811,Myong,"and I had to grab data another way, can you think of a reason for this?"
426,2017-07-31T15:05:45.103229,Beula,Are you talking about internal tkinter apis?
426,2017-07-31T15:06:23.123608,Myong,"Yeah, just going through the object attributes. I'm never touching `tkinter` again, but wasn't sure what that might be from"
426,2017-07-31T15:06:45.136149,Myong,All same versions of most everything
426,2017-07-31T15:07:01.144990,Beula,Are you and the co-worker on different OSs?
426,2017-07-31T15:07:08.148547,Myong,"Nope, same OS"
426,2017-07-31T15:08:45.200878,Beula,weird ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
426,2017-07-31T15:12:52.333067,Beula,ahh that was awesome looking
427,2017-07-31T15:48:17.456906,Ouida,_takes notes_ avoid tkinter... got it
427,2017-07-31T15:54:17.649311,Myong,save yourself the headache and just smash your hear into a wall
427,2017-07-31T15:55:42.695035,Alanna,not sure this is the right spot for this ..
427,2017-07-31T15:56:25.718309,Myong,Where are you seeing your module?
427,2017-07-31T15:56:34.723299,Myong,In an IDE or `requirements.txt` you have?
427,2017-07-31T15:58:10.776155,Alanna,"shell -- imported pip. Then set ""installed = pip.get_installed_distributions()"" ... then ""installed_packages_list = sorted([""%s==%s"" % (i.key, i.version)"""

427,2017-07-31T15:58:40.793247,Myong,"use ` on the ~ key to format text like so, just a bit easier to read"
427,2017-07-31T15:59:18.814218,Alanna,doh - sorry...slatiquette violation
427,2017-07-31T15:59:44.828022,Myong,So is `mytest-module` a module you created I'd imagine
427,2017-07-31T15:59:50.831331,Alanna,correct
427,2017-07-31T15:59:58.835841,Myong,any modules or `.py` files should only use `_`
427,2017-07-31T16:00:02.838017,Myong,no `-`
427,2017-07-31T16:00:17.847496,Myong,because the `-` is not a proper identifier
427,2017-07-31T16:00:22.850341,Alanna,figured it was that -- but i wanted a 2nd opinion
427,2017-07-31T16:00:47.864350,Myong,No problem
427,2017-07-31T16:02:26.917973,Patty,"The syntax for importing modules like that is `__import__('my-module')`, but as <@Myong> said, use `_`"
427,2017-07-31T16:03:08.940609,Myong,^
427,2017-07-31T16:03:56.966271,Alanna,"tbh .. not sure how the hyphen made it in there, it's nowhere in the package."
427,2017-07-31T16:06:18.043141,Patty,"generally even underscores aren’t PEP8 compliant: “Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.

When an extension module written in C or C++ has an accompanying Python module that provides a higher level (e.g. more object oriented) interface, the C/C++ module has a leading underscore (e.g. _socket ).”"
427,2017-07-31T16:11:20.202977,Alanna,^ that's what I ended up doing. Removed all underscores and converted to all lowercase.

431,2017-07-31T20:38:07.073775,Jed,also thanks <@Deedee> for the helpful tips :taco:
431,2017-07-31T21:36:11.809859,Orpha,"<@Jed> what is your expected output? this is a little confusing. Not fulling understanding what you are doing, returning total_seconds like that is only going to return total_seconds of the last iteration of that for loop"
431,2017-07-31T21:52:42.009833,Winnifred,"<@Jed>, check out `.map` and `.apply` to make your life a little easier!"
431,2017-08-01T00:00:39.395281,Jed,"Hi, I just wanted to find the mean of the column, but I had trouble in the `xx:xx:xx.xxxxxx` format so I thought I’d convert it into `int`"
432,2017-08-01T01:44:13.433859,Beverley,I've got a python/django issue need help with. I'm sending a curl request with json to a url (code below)
432,2017-08-01T01:44:25.435939,Beverley,"curl -X POST -d ""username=john&amp;password=john2&amp;email=john@email.com&amp;first_name=john&amp;last_name=smith"" <http://localhost:8000/api-user-create/>"
432,2017-08-01T01:44:44.439401,Beverley,and I'm getting an error parsing the json here's how I'm parsing it...
432,2017-08-01T01:45:04.443146,Beverley,"@csrf_exempt
	def create_user(request):
		response = {'status': None}

		if request.method == 'POST':
			data = json.loads(request.body)"
432,2017-08-01T01:45:31.448057,Beula,"the body there isn't JSON, it's form encoded"
432,2017-08-01T01:45:32.448285,Beverley,then I can get the data like &gt; username = data['username']
432,2017-08-01T01:46:07.454351,Beula,is it not bombing on the `json.loads`?
432,2017-08-01T01:46:29.458519,Beverley,yes it crashes there
432,2017-08-01T01:46:55.463273,Beverley,"not sure how best to do this, I've been doing this for requests from an actual browser"
432,2017-08-01T01:47:16.467224,Beula,"If you want to send in json with curl:  `curl -X POST -d '{""manual"": ""json""}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' <http://localhost/route>`"
432,2017-08-01T01:47:54.473665,Beverley,ah got it
432,2017-08-01T01:48:04.475502,Beula,"but, doing that doesn't give you any validations with manually calling `json.loads`, so you get other issues there."
432,2017-08-01T01:48:22.478737,Beula,"You can just the built in django forms, and just use forms so you get the validation logic"
432,2017-08-01T01:49:11.487681,Beverley,but json.loads will work this way... django is a backend for an app and the client wants to use jwt i.e. json only to communicate
432,2017-08-01T01:49:32.491347,Beula,"jwt is a bearer token format, it doesn't indicate the app is json only"
432,2017-08-01T01:49:55.495280,Beula,but it's okay if that's the way you want to communicate. In that case if this is a big api - you may want to try out django-rest-framework
432,2017-08-01T01:50:01.496528,Beula,It'll save you a lot of manual work like that
432,2017-08-01T01:50:18.499646,Beverley,yes I'm getting user token with it but he wants additional features so I'm mimicking the input &gt; output format
432,2017-08-01T01:51:16.510377,Beverley,I would try that but this is a small project and I'm keeping it simple
432,2017-08-01T01:51:24.511815,Beula,cool :slightly_smiling_face:

432,2017-08-01T02:14:23.783116,Beula,sure thing
433,2017-08-01T04:54:59.732191,Lanita,"So, I've been using `__all__` for some time now to quickly declare to the programmer which functions of a module is to be used by other modules (more or less, when you open a file, the ""entry point(s)"" that other files that import this file uses can be found by reading `__all__`). It's quite helpful, but the problem is that e.g. sphinx by default won't add the docstrings of private functions. This makes sense if I'm writing API docs, but not so much if I want to cover all functions.

How would you handle this issue?"
433,2017-08-01T04:56:18.763161,Ciera,`sphinx by default won't add the docstrings of private functions` there should be an option to activate it for all functions
433,2017-08-01T04:57:28.791161,Lanita,Is that reasonable though? Maybe it's me who should rethink what the documentation should be used for.
433,2017-08-01T04:58:23.812615,Collette,<@Lanita> it's unusual to write a non-api documentation in the source code
433,2017-08-01T05:00:08.855122,Lanita,<@Collette> Why? If I write valid rst docstrings for private functions they can be used by other tools
433,2017-08-01T05:03:35.937960,Lanita,"I suppose that one of the reasons I care about this is that sphinx won't pass over my private functions by default, and thus I won't get any indication of rst syntax warnings/errors in my private functions, so they'll likely be broken and not noticed"
433,2017-08-01T05:03:37.938602,Ciera,well in this case they shouldn't be private
433,2017-08-01T05:04:32.959714,Lanita,"But sometimes the gritty details needs an explanation/overview, and that might as well be in rst, right? That doesn't mean that they shouldn't be private. Equating private with ""doesn't need docstring"" seems weird to me"
433,2017-08-01T05:05:03.971881,Gabriele,"I agree with <@Lanita> . Documentation isn't just for end-users; it's for coworkers. Or myself, in future."
433,2017-08-01T05:06:09.997720,Lanita,"In my case, my sphinx documentation is 100% for co-workers that can code, and that will probably continue to be the case for some time."
433,2017-08-01T05:07:09.020549,Lanita,"But the thing is, my coworker might as well read the code to begin with, so maybe it makes sense to only declare the interfaces, given how readable raw rst is and python's readability in general..."
433,2017-08-01T05:07:46.034474,Gabriele,"I disagree; ""read the source"" is a poor substitute for good documentation"
433,2017-08-01T05:08:21.047436,Ciera,I don't understand what do you want <@Lanita> ? sphinx to generate doc for private method that have docstrings ?
433,2017-08-01T05:08:50.058450,Lanita,"That is what people *say*, but in reality, do people work like that? It's one thing to use a library, but when you're adding functionality to a codebase?"
433,2017-08-01T05:09:55.082381,Lanita,"The reason I'm saying this is that my coworkers seem to be the people that prefers to read the source code directly, but maybe they're just used to an environment without documentation... sigh."
433,2017-08-01T05:10:47.102691,Lanita,"<@Ciera> I suppose I want a general discussion on how documentation is to be used, which I suppose would fit better in random. Oh well."
433,2017-08-01T05:11:17.114038,Collette,"<@Lanita> because api changes, but general ideas and core functionality often doesn't change"
433,2017-08-01T05:11:23.116270,Gabriele,"Source code and documentation go hand in hand. If I have documentation, I'll go there first. It also helps to communicate intent _far_ quicker than reading code does."
433,2017-08-01T05:11:39.122142,Collette,"Because when you try to express everything in __doc__, `help(obj)` becomes unreadable"
433,2017-08-01T05:12:19.137319,Lanita,"<@Collette> , so you leave off private functions entirely in your fancy-looking documentation? (e.g. sphinx)"
433,2017-08-01T05:12:30.141558,Collette,Yes. That's why they're private
433,2017-08-01T05:13:04.154210,Collette,"I can include them into a ""how to read the source code"" guide though"
433,2017-08-01T05:15:54.218304,Lanita,"<@Collette> that certainly seems like a sensible approach, and probably the most applicable to my use case. But it does push other developers towards ""read the source"" fairly quickly. Which I suppose is what is happening in my organization anyways."
433,2017-08-01T05:16:38.235540,Lanita,"So, defining __all__ in every python file is a reasonable idea, I presume? Any places where I shouldn't be doing that?"
433,2017-08-01T05:17:13.248800,Collette,"Well, you can't cover everything with docs. Sometimes you have to hijack the library and do dirty stuff. That's why I often write ""how to read the source code"" guides"
433,2017-08-01T05:17:21.251913,Collette,"But still, `__all__` is a must"
433,2017-08-01T05:18:00.266512,Lanita,"Seems reasonable. Any pointers (blog posts, whatever) on how to write such guides? At what level should they be?"
433,2017-08-01T05:22:08.361466,Lanita,"I usually use the top-level docstring to explain intent, and that usually includes mentions of both public and private functions. Though should I consider the top-level docstring to be public or private?"
433,2017-08-01T05:25:52.448023,Collette,"I put them in docs, not in `__doc__`. I try to explain the flow of a single successful request, how it goes from the entry point to the handler. And how you can hijack various parts of the handler if they aren't specified as the public api"
433,2017-08-01T05:27:07.476349,Collette,"If the intent of the library isn't clear, or the module names aren't obvious for a novice reader, I often document where's the entry point and if there is some private stuff that gets overridden by children classes"
434,2017-08-01T06:16:46.571186,Cassaundra,Hi
434,2017-08-01T06:17:17.581476,Cassaundra,Could anyone advise me how to scrape the data from the Javascript Webpages?

434,2017-08-01T06:19:14.620350,Cassaundra,Thanks for the advise:slightly_smiling_face:
434,2017-08-01T06:19:45.630365,Suellen,<#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping>

434,2017-08-01T06:24:39.725138,Suellen,"Not the website, but a page."
434,2017-08-01T06:29:42.820669,Cassaundra,Sorry couldn't get you
434,2017-08-01T06:29:52.823911,Cassaundra,i have no idea about JS
434,2017-08-01T06:31:10.849889,Gabriele,"If the data is all being served up by Javascript then you can't scrape it. You'll want to watch which calls are being made to get the JSON data (or equivalent), and replicate those to get the data"
434,2017-08-01T06:31:29.856155,Gabriele,Or ask Munchery if they have an API you can use
434,2017-08-01T07:32:57.991037,Patty,"<@Cassaundra> also please check the terms of service of a site before asking questions about things that could violate TOS like scraping. The sites TOS is pretty clear on that, so your questions are better in <#C68GBADG8|etc_greyhat>"
434,2017-08-01T07:36:20.054096,Cassaundra,<@Patty> Ok:+1:
435,2017-08-01T09:55:10.747442,Zaida,"Simple one off question that I’ve thought too much about:
I made a website in Django that does a whole bunch of different things for me as a teacher, like gradebooks, assigning math problems to specific students, doling out digital awards, scraping the sites we use, sending parent letters, etc. When I describe it quickly to actual developers/programmers, what’s the easiest way to describe something like that?
Website? App? Program? What’s the usual term for a django site?"
435,2017-08-01T09:57:59.856427,Beula,"You're bordering on a ""LMS"" (Learning Management System) - but I usually just say ""site"".

In my anecdotal experience:

1. site/website -&gt; normal web application
2. webapp -&gt; borders on 1, but usually this gets more into more client side stuff, or an SPA type setup with an API and more functionality than the standard forms of a site
3. program -&gt; pretty vague, could be website, desktop app, etc.
4. app -&gt; often mobile specific

But given a little context anyone will catch your drift"
435,2017-08-01T09:58:38.881913,Zaida,"Interesting, so teaching websites like mine have their own acronym? Good to know"
435,2017-08-01T10:00:09.942196,Zaida,"Webapp is what I’ve been shooting for. Thanks! After making it for a year, I’ve only just started talking about it with people who know any coding and quickly realized I don’t know how to describe it to anyone who knows their stuff."
435,2017-08-01T10:06:55.209746,Beula,"LMS is a bit more, but sounds like you have a lot of one. Blackboard, Desire2Learn, Instructure Canvas, Moodle, all examples of LMS related sites"
435,2017-08-01T10:39:46.499653,Zaida,"Yeah, I checked out a few and it’s definitely not at the level of most of those, but seems to have some overlap. :taco: to you, <@Beula>"
435,2017-08-01T10:40:05.511807,Zaida,Well I screwed that up.
435,2017-08-01T10:54:44.104145,Beula,<@Zaida> :taco: for solving a need for your work! Do you come from programming or pick it up for this project?
435,2017-08-01T11:56:24.620243,Zaida,"<@Beula> Picked it up last summer to make my teaching more efficient/effective. But now I’m looking to learn enough to become a professional developer and hopefully work for an education based company, ala Khan Academy or the like."
435,2017-08-01T11:57:03.646898,Zaida,"Spent 4 years in the classroom, and a few in Graphic design before that, so the tech/design + education is something that I’m really interested in."
435,2017-08-01T12:20:52.562843,Johana,that’s a cool space to work in <@Zaida>. i work for an education based start-up. <http://openstax.org|openstax.org>
435,2017-08-01T12:21:32.587452,Beula,That's really cool!
435,2017-08-01T12:23:05.644242,Zaida,"Whoa, Mike, openstax looks awesome."
435,2017-08-01T12:23:08.646278,Johana,<@Zaida> i would def. try to integrate with some LMS. for some reason it’s something that comes up last i don’t know why. we are currently making an integration with canvas.
435,2017-08-01T12:23:28.658300,Johana,yea we’re pretty cool. especially the fact that we make free textbooks.
435,2017-08-01T12:23:52.673165,Johana,we’ll be launching our first paid product this fall. <https://tutor.openstax.org/>
435,2017-08-01T12:24:55.710814,Johana,we’re a bit different than khan academy. i’ve met with those folks before :wink:. we actually publish research vs khan academy who doesn’t.
435,2017-08-01T12:25:06.717612,Zaida,I love the entire concept of you guys.
435,2017-08-01T12:25:15.722834,Beula,Is that the flask app mike?
435,2017-08-01T12:25:32.733528,Johana,well i’ve blown up the flask app now but yea it was the personalized learning part <@Beula>
435,2017-08-01T12:25:50.744511,Beula,What is it now?
435,2017-08-01T12:25:55.747366,Zaida,Do you see yourself as a ‘disruptive’ service? I know the price of textbooks has been a massive issue for years now.
435,2017-08-01T12:26:00.750393,Beula,"and Canvas is the best LMS from what I hear, but moodle is FOSS"
435,2017-08-01T12:26:02.751542,Johana,just pure python and api post requests.
435,2017-08-01T12:26:14.759211,Johana,yea we have been disrupted the market really good lately.
435,2017-08-01T12:26:20.762816,Zaida,"Way to go, man."
435,2017-08-01T12:26:24.765105,Johana,several big book publishers have partnered with us.
435,2017-08-01T12:26:43.777425,Johana,"which is basically saying, “since they can’t beat us they’ve joined us.” lol"
435,2017-08-01T12:26:59.786639,Zaida,"I teach 2nd Grade, so it’s a bit of a different world here, but still we have to shell out untold amounts of $ to pearson every year."
435,2017-08-01T12:27:24.802557,Johana,yea we tried to do k-12
435,2017-08-01T12:27:31.806687,Zaida,And the user interface I make for Kindergarten-4th grade (that’s all my school covers at the moment) can’t be as complicated as a blackboard or a canvas.
435,2017-08-01T12:27:35.809314,Johana,we had another product called concept coach but the grant money didn’t come in
435,2017-08-01T12:27:40.812434,Johana,we had to pivot to college students.
435,2017-08-01T12:27:50.818949,Zaida,Great demo to start with.
435,2017-08-01T12:28:10.831083,Johana,spaced practice is where its at.
435,2017-08-01T12:28:48.854747,Johana,and of course we have our own algorithms with academic papers written to compute the topic mastery of students.
435,2017-08-01T12:29:25.877908,Zaida,"Oh! Do you know of any open-source algorithms for spaced practice? I’d love to incorporate something like what Anki uses into my app, but couldn’t find anything that I thought I could use."
435,2017-08-01T12:29:36.885111,Johana,i only know of anki.
435,2017-08-01T12:29:37.885837,Johana,i love it

&gt; When you use the thumbnail template tag sorl-thumbnail looks up the thumbnail in a Key Value Store. The key for a thumbnail is generated from its filename and storage. The thumbnail filename in turn is generated from the source and requested thumbnail size and options. If the key for the thumbnail is found in the Key Value Store, the serialized thumbnail information is fetched from it and returned. If the thumbnail key is not found there sorl-thumbnail continues to generate the thumbnail and stores necessary information in the Key Value Store.

I am not familiar with the lib, but it appears to cache all thumbs"

447,2017-08-02T13:11:27.302440,Arturo,Is there a way to see a list of all the channels in slack?
447,2017-08-02T13:11:47.313948,Arturo,duuhh just found it lol
448,2017-08-02T13:39:22.310597,Jed,"<@Winnifred> thanks for the .apply tip, got it figured out finally! :taco:"
448,2017-08-02T13:42:25.418898,Winnifred,"Thanks, <@Jed>! I try to resist the ~urg~ urge to use control structures or things outside of the `pandas` and `numpy` libs when munging/processing `DataFrame`s."
449,2017-08-02T15:50:54.919773,Kristopher,"I'm writing a unittest and I find that one of my test cases will generate either an ssl.CertificateError or an Exception with a message of ""8.8.8.8 is not a VIM server"". Is there a way to write my unit test to check to see that if one of the two cases gets raised in this situation?
It kinda looks like 
```        def test_connect_non_vim_server_host(self):
             non_vim_conn = connector.Connector(""8.8.8.8"")
             # with self.assertRaisesMessage(Exception, ""8.8.8.8:443 is not a VIM server""):
             with self.assertRaises(ssl.CertificateError):
                 non_vim_conn.connect_to_server()```"
449,2017-08-02T15:55:45.084577,Meghan,"So, it works with ss.CertificateError, but you want to check for either possibility?"
449,2017-08-02T15:57:25.141727,Kristopher,"<@Meghan> Sometimes it's an ssl.CertificateError and sometimes it generates the Exception with the ""is not a VIM server"" message"
449,2017-08-02T15:57:40.150307,Meghan,And you want to have either be a pass for the test?
449,2017-08-02T15:57:44.152403,Kristopher,Yes
449,2017-08-02T15:58:37.183276,Meghan,"Not sure if assertRaises can do that, but how about:
```
try:
    exceptional_thing()
except ssl.CertificateError:
    self.assertEqual(True, True)
except OtherThing:
    self.assertEqual(True, True)
```"
449,2017-08-02T15:59:08.201343,Kristopher,Let me try that and I'll get back to you. What would that assertEqual usually be in a case like this?
449,2017-08-02T15:59:32.215285,Meghan,"You would put your function as one of the parameters there, and the expected result as the other."
449,2017-08-02T15:59:50.225868,Meghan,"```self.assertEqual(add(1,2), 3)```"
449,2017-08-02T16:00:20.244312,Meghan,"I suppose you will want an else clause, and in it put self.assertEqual(True, False) to get a failure."
449,2017-08-02T16:01:19.278795,Meghan,"With that though, can you narrow down what the exceptional condition should be so you know which exception it will give and you can test more accurately?"
449,2017-08-02T16:04:39.391438,Meghan,"You could also use Exception rather than a specific exception, however, I don't like vague. If the two exceptions are related, that is one inherits from the other, or both inherit from a common exception, you could use that as well."
449,2017-08-02T16:06:38.456467,Meghan,"<@Kristopher>, I'm leaving the office, if you want to continue tag me so I get a notification."
449,2017-08-02T16:06:54.465325,Kristopher,"Ok, thank you for letting me know"
449,2017-08-02T16:23:31.016425,Kristopher,"<@Meghan> Thank you, I figured it out."
449,2017-08-02T16:26:22.112591,Tameika,my attempt was this : `table = table[bool_exp]`
449,2017-08-02T16:27:40.156209,Tameika,"actually, `bool_exp` is something like this : `table['col1'].str.split('_').tolist()[0][2] in somelist`"
449,2017-08-02T16:29:21.213132,Winnifred,"<@Tameika>, do you want to extract rows based on boolean values of a specific column in `table` ?"
449,2017-08-02T16:31:37.291678,Tameika,"hey kennes sorry for the ambiguity. every element of table['col1'] is : ABC_DEF_xyz_KLM. If `xyz` is a member of `somelist`, I extract that row."
449,2017-08-02T16:48:40.859708,Tameika,`somelist` is a list of string entries which may potentially contain `xyz`.
449,2017-08-02T16:50:15.912315,Tameika,Could you point to an example for map? I have a hard time wrapping my head around map and Series objects.
449,2017-08-02T16:53:34.021649,Winnifred,"To solve this issue, create a temporary column like so `table.temp = table.col1.map(lambda x: 1 if x in somelist else 0)` and then do `table = table[table.temp == 1]` then drop your `temp` column."
449,2017-08-02T17:00:42.263284,Tameika,true
449,2017-08-02T17:04:19.381330,Tameika,dropping temp column :`del table['temp']` does not work?
449,2017-08-02T17:14:23.685466,Tameika,"yes, I did the get the rows I wanted -- thanks!"
450,2017-08-02T16:25:36.087182,Tameika,hey everyone! i have a question in pandas about how to extract rows of a given dataframe based on a certain condition. So let's say I have a dataframe `table` and the condition is `bool_exp` which evaluates to true or false. How I can extract all rows of the dataframe which satisfy this condition?
450,2017-08-02T16:42:06.642848,Winnifred,What is `somelist`?
450,2017-08-02T16:44:35.724796,Winnifred,"typically, if you’re trying to perform calculations on `Series`objects, you can use `.map` so in your case `table.col1.map(some_function_you_wrote(value))`"
450,2017-08-02T16:49:43.894113,Winnifred,Ah I understand now.
450,2017-08-02T16:51:44.961455,Winnifred,yes!
450,2017-08-02T16:54:34.054448,Tameika,"ok, let me this try it out."
450,2017-08-02T16:56:14.110978,Winnifred,`x` will be the extracted `_xyz_` portion
450,2017-08-02T17:07:26.478971,Winnifred,"first, did you get the rows you wanted?"
450,2017-08-02T17:14:29.688223,Tameika,finally :smile:
450,2017-08-02T17:14:35.691295,Winnifred,:boom:
450,2017-08-02T17:15:48.727453,Tameika,"so, dropping the col?"
450,2017-08-02T17:16:48.756357,Winnifred,"oh, check out the `.drop` method!"
450,2017-08-02T17:17:02.763243,Tameika,cool!
451,2017-08-02T19:43:43.856365,Albert,"hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I wanted to ask a really simple question about machine learning (reviewing some python code that uses sckit learn's RandomForestClassifier to generate a model using some data)"

453,2017-08-03T04:26:12.736360,Junita,"re: python 2.7, there’s probably a package for it.  but I’d invest some time in upgrading."

453,2017-08-03T04:31:29.858529,Ciera,if you are on ubuntu `python` should point to `python2`
453,2017-08-03T04:31:49.866307,Ciera,or maybe it doesn't do it on a fresh install ?

454,2017-08-03T07:49:49.062030,Ciera,the default is python3

454,2017-08-03T07:55:03.162326,Meg,oh
454,2017-08-03T07:55:05.162919,Meg,that's why

454,2017-08-03T08:04:19.353189,Junita,I’d just bite the bullet and upgrade projects to python3.  it really isn’t that hard.
454,2017-08-03T08:04:44.362416,Junita,I put it off for years and it ended up being really easy
454,2017-08-03T08:05:07.370584,Junita,then again that’s because I had a good test suite I suppose.  if that’s not the case perhaps that’s the first priority.  :stuck_out_tongue:

458,2017-08-05T01:36:38.625387,Staci,why does this print letters instead of a word?
458,2017-08-05T01:38:16.630545,Staci,"Nevermind, I'm an idiot"
458,2017-08-05T01:38:31.631390,Staci,should be using .split()
458,2017-08-05T11:10:23.800191,Staci,Does anyone do codewars?
458,2017-08-05T11:10:43.801820,Staci,I'm having an issue with this one: <https://www.codewars.com/kata/playing-with-digits/train/python>
458,2017-08-05T11:11:52.807702,Staci,"All my tests pass, except the last one when I try to submit"
458,2017-08-05T11:12:28.810706,Staci,"I get this response from the test: ""None should equal 12933"""
458,2017-08-05T11:12:44.811940,Staci,"Which appears to be some kind of error, unless I'm missing something"
458,2017-08-05T11:16:27.830844,Staci,"Actually, I think I got it."
459,2017-08-04T03:50:18.067133,Robbin,going over there :stuck_out_tongue: shall i delete this post?
460,2017-08-04T19:10:44.456641,Shonda,"does anyone know how I can check if an instgarm token is invalid, and if so, prompt the user to reauth on the front end?"
460,2017-08-04T21:25:20.560440,Beula,"<@Shonda> not sure if you fixed this already, but I think you should be able to just try to get the users profile info and that'll be enough to tell you. Another option is to just keep track since per the oauth2 spec you should have gotten the expiration when they logged in "
461,2017-08-05T16:04:37.314423,Amanda,Thanks for the link to codewars. Awesome site
462,2017-08-06T04:14:07.836262,Patrick,Hi everyone!
463,2017-08-06T08:14:49.651052,Meredith,"hi can someone help me, because i created a object from django createview but i want to redirect them to the updateview of that object is that possible?"
463,2017-08-06T08:46:56.771375,Tandra,<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/http/shortcuts/#redirect> using redirect with args sounds like what you're after <@Meredith>
463,2017-08-06T08:48:14.776059,Meredith,"thanks mate <@Tandra>, ya i found it also its just a matter of content manipulation."

464,2017-08-06T13:33:09.104932,Staci,my final solution ^^
464,2017-08-06T13:35:15.114953,Tandra,try adding where the .so module resides to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
464,2017-08-06T13:52:56.201217,Elanor,can you tell me what should I type into terminal
464,2017-08-06T13:53:09.202233,Elanor,I'm newbie to Linux
464,2017-08-06T13:55:35.213959,Tandra,"export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""your path"""
464,2017-08-06T13:56:16.217175,Tandra,this most likely should be set in your bash.rc or equivalent iirc to persist
464,2017-08-06T13:56:28.218143,Tandra,sorry it's been a long time since using
464,2017-08-06T13:57:25.223004,Elanor,if there is any spaces in the path
464,2017-08-06T13:57:35.223904,Elanor,I think that causing some problems
464,2017-08-06T13:58:15.227095,Tandra,use single quotes?
464,2017-08-06T13:58:58.230542,Elanor,I tried
464,2017-08-06T13:59:19.232365,Elanor,how can I know what is my PythonPath right now to see if the export worked or not
464,2017-08-06T13:59:59.235718,Tandra,"python -c ""import sys; print(sys.path)"""
464,2017-08-06T14:02:31.249995,Elanor,the new path is not there
464,2017-08-06T14:04:13.258338,Tandra,because im not entirely sure how to help you here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18247333/python-pythonpath-in-linux>
464,2017-08-06T14:04:45.261122,Tandra,looks like sound advice imo
464,2017-08-06T14:11:19.294153,Elanor,"I didn't solve the issue yet , let me see if I can figure out what I'm missing"
464,2017-08-06T14:28:55.382610,Elanor,done buddy I copied the shared library to /usr/lib
464,2017-08-06T14:29:05.383446,Elanor,appreciate your help :slightly_smiling_face:
464,2017-08-06T14:30:08.388961,Tandra,sweet :+1: you maybe coulda symlinked it too
464,2017-08-06T14:30:23.390319,Tandra,might help incase it ever updates
464,2017-08-06T14:37:09.425154,Elanor,its alread symlinked
464,2017-08-06T16:13:58.899407,Staci,"Yea I realized that after, I switched the order"
465,2017-08-06T16:09:48.879990,Sidney,"<@Staci> fwiw, you don't need the `key` in your call to `sorted`. What you have is the default behavior anyway."

466,2017-08-06T19:56:43.992602,Kanesha,<@Kiara> Omg thanks. I missed that.
467,2017-08-06T22:03:37.961627,Tameika,what should PYTHONPATH point to?
468,2017-08-06T22:07:56.999140,Collette,<@Tameika> you shouldn't touch it
468,2017-08-06T22:08:12.001330,Collette,Forget that exists
468,2017-08-06T22:09:05.009222,Tameika,"ok, but I got this error. ``` /usr/local/include/boost/python/detail/wrap_python.hpp:50:11: fatal error: 'pyconfig.h' file not found

468,2017-08-06T22:09:45.014854,Tameika,same issues as here : <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19810940/ubuntu-linking-boost-python-fatal-error-pyconfig-cannot-be-found>
468,2017-08-06T22:10:57.025524,Tameika,not sure where is pyconfig.h in my system either :disappointed:
468,2017-08-06T22:11:15.028091,Collette,`find / -name pyconfig.h`
468,2017-08-06T22:11:33.030590,Collette,`find /usr/include/ -name pyconfig.h` is probably better
468,2017-08-06T22:11:45.032188,Tameika,"yes, did that. its not there"
468,2017-08-06T22:12:11.036085,Collette,Have you installed `python-dev` package?
468,2017-08-06T22:12:35.039422,Tameika,let me check
468,2017-08-06T22:13:35.048333,Tameika,is it python-devel for mac?
468,2017-08-06T22:14:36.057021,Collette,How did you install python on your mac? Are you using built-in one?
468,2017-08-06T22:15:25.064593,Tameika,i have both python2 and python3
468,2017-08-06T22:15:49.068105,Tameika,i am using the built in one for python2 (currently working on that for boost python)
468,2017-08-06T22:16:05.070390,Tameika,i also did: `brew reinstall python`
468,2017-08-06T22:16:27.073933,Collette,"Okay, then you need to run `xcode-select --install` to install the development headers"
468,2017-08-06T22:16:59.078479,Tameika,thats the whole command?
468,2017-08-06T22:17:02.078943,Collette,Yes
468,2017-08-06T22:17:21.081949,Tameika,"`xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use ""Software Update"" to install updates`"
468,2017-08-06T22:17:26.082709,Collette,"By the way, re-using the pre-installed python is probably a bad idea. I'd go with `brew` version of python"
468,2017-08-06T22:17:30.083302,Collette,"Yeah, that's why"
468,2017-08-06T22:18:15.089927,Tameika,"oh, how do i find if it is pre-installed or from brew?"
468,2017-08-06T22:18:21.090754,Tameika,actually i am not quite sure
468,2017-08-06T22:20:13.107421,Collette,"If `which python` points to homebrew's bin, then it was installed by brew"
468,2017-08-06T22:20:14.107642,Tameika,"ok, i found pyconfig.h is actually here : /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7"
468,2017-08-06T22:20:39.111335,Tameika,which python actually points to here : `/usr/bin/python`
468,2017-08-06T22:21:05.115588,Collette,Then you're using the pre-installed python
468,2017-08-06T22:21:29.119106,Tameika,shit
468,2017-08-06T22:21:47.121757,Tameika,should I follow this and remove the entire framework <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22774529/what-is-the-safest-way-to-removing-python-framework-files-that-are-located-in-di>
468,2017-08-06T22:23:20.135422,Collette,Don't mess with your system
468,2017-08-06T22:24:20.144234,Collette,Also you probably haven't read the question carefully - it's about pythons installed neither by brew or system
468,2017-08-06T22:24:42.147425,Tameika,oh ok
468,2017-08-06T22:26:28.163237,Tameika,"so, what is the best way to resolve this and make my Sunday fruitful :neutral_face: ?"
468,2017-08-06T22:27:58.177234,Collette,Start from <https://stackoverflow.com/a/7375583>
468,2017-08-06T22:28:42.183953,Collette,Then try to include paths to the brew's python headers for cmake explicitly
468,2017-08-06T22:32:45.223078,Tameika,"ok, I ran `which -a python` and understood that there is only one version of python at `/usr/bin/python`"
468,2017-08-06T22:33:11.227052,Tameika,"so, either 1. i did not use brew to install python"
468,2017-08-06T22:33:54.233866,Tameika,or 2. brew installed python at `/usr/bin`
468,2017-08-06T22:34:49.242407,Collette,What `brew ls -v python` says?
468,2017-08-06T22:35:53.252350,Tameika,many files in `/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13_1/`
468,2017-08-06T22:37:17.265192,Collette,"Do you have `/usr/local/bin` in your PATH, as SO answer suggests? Have you read that answer?"
468,2017-08-06T22:38:47.278561,Tameika,"yes, it has higher priority over others"
468,2017-08-06T22:38:59.280366,Tameika,echo $PATH gives me this : `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`
468,2017-08-06T22:39:10.282056,Collette,Do you have `python` in `/usr/local/bin`?
468,2017-08-06T22:40:36.294902,Tameika,seems to be linked files?
468,2017-08-06T22:44:30.330605,Marcie,"yes, they're all linked to the Cellar"
468,2017-08-06T22:44:35.331362,Marcie,`lrwxr-xr-x  1 seanjohnson  admin  34  7 Jul 14:35 /usr/local/bin/python -&gt; ../Cellar/python/2.7.13/bin/python`
468,2017-08-06T22:44:59.335050,Marcie,should just be a matter of putting `/usr/local/bin/` in your path then
468,2017-08-06T22:45:17.337999,Tameika,"yes, -- it is already in my path. `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`"
468,2017-08-06T22:45:36.341256,Tameika,"still, i get the error ``` /usr/local/include/boost/python/detail/wrap_python.hpp:50:11: fatal error: 'pyconfig.h' file not found
# include &lt;pyconfig.h&gt;
          ^```"
468,2017-08-06T22:45:47.342835,Tameika,any thoughts on why this is the case?
468,2017-08-06T22:50:15.382087,Marcie,it's confusing as to why `/usr/local/bin/python` is not showing up for `which python`
468,2017-08-06T22:52:21.400820,Marcie,though both the system and brew python should be able to find `pyconfig.h`
468,2017-08-06T22:52:45.404430,Marcie,`/usr/bin/python-config` and `/usr/local/bin/python-config` should both return valid include directories that have `pyconfig.h` in them
468,2017-08-06T22:53:56.415293,Marcie,"like so:
```find $(/usr/bin/python-config --includes | sed ""s/-I//g"") | grep ""pyconfig.h""
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h```"
468,2017-08-06T22:54:16.418262,Marcie,"```find $(/usr/local/bin/python-config --includes | sed ""s/-I//g"") | grep ""pyconfig.h""
/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h
/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h```"
468,2017-08-06T22:54:25.419656,Tameika,"Yes, I have the same output"
468,2017-08-06T22:54:29.420443,Tameika,"```/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7/pyconfig.h```"
468,2017-08-06T22:54:59.425177,Tameika,not for the second one
468,2017-08-06T22:55:07.426628,Tameika,"```zsh: no such file or directory: /usr/local/bin/python-config

468,2017-08-06T22:55:30.430172,Tameika,why is there no file : `/usr/local/bin/python-config` ?
468,2017-08-06T22:56:15.437009,Marcie,weird
468,2017-08-06T22:56:38.440432,Tameika,can I just modify PYTHONPATH somehow?
468,2017-08-06T22:56:45.441583,Tameika,that was my first question
468,2017-08-06T22:56:58.443727,Tameika,but was told to not touch it
468,2017-08-06T22:57:47.451673,Collette,PYTHONPATH has nothing to do with your issue
468,2017-08-06T22:58:21.457037,Tameika,ok
468,2017-08-06T22:58:36.459473,Marcie,"yeah, it's the path for finding imports, your issue is finding headers for boost's C++ compilation"
468,2017-08-06T22:59:19.466485,Marcie,how are you installing boost.python domarps?
468,2017-08-06T23:00:26.477803,Tameika,`brew install boost-python`
468,2017-08-06T23:08:06.549845,Tameika,"i went ahead and ran this command : ```export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=""$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7""```"
468,2017-08-06T23:08:20.551920,Tameika,"and when I run make now, it gives me the following error"

468,2017-08-06T23:16:39.624111,Marcie,"generally trying to shove these things from external environment variables tends to go poorly, you could try passing the output of `python-config2 --cflags` to your g++ command"
468,2017-08-06T23:17:20.630193,Marcie,though i'd probably advise reinstalling your python brew itself because something is wrong from the very start if your path is not picking up  `/usr/local/bin/python`
468,2017-08-06T23:18:17.637814,Marcie,"and just to confirm, this is trying to compile a program that uses python-boost, and not compiling python-boost itself?"
468,2017-08-06T23:18:29.639483,Tameika,"yes, true!"
468,2017-08-06T23:18:43.641736,Tameika,just running Hello World from here : <https://github.com/TNG/boost-python-examples/tree/master/01-HelloWorld>
468,2017-08-06T23:21:08.662809,Marcie,ohhh
468,2017-08-06T23:21:16.663894,Marcie,yeah this is all wrapped up and handled in `build.sh`
468,2017-08-06T23:21:38.666980,Marcie,"do you get this output in build.sh:
```-- Found PythonInterp: /usr/local/bin/python (found version ""2.7.13"")

468,2017-08-06T23:21:57.669385,Tameika,"yeah, but since I wanted to try each module on my own for a different project, I went ahead and ran `cmake .` in HelloWorld"
468,2017-08-06T23:22:07.670843,Tameika,just let me run build.sj
468,2017-08-06T23:23:15.680487,Marcie,yeah that's your main issue then
468,2017-08-06T23:23:28.682404,Marcie,there's output from `build.sh` that shows what arguments `cmake` is expecting
468,2017-08-06T23:24:06.687966,Marcie,though there appears to be some stuff that the root CMakeLists.txt does for preprocessing some examples
468,2017-08-06T23:24:40.692679,Marcie,"`cmake` is smart enough to know not to recompile things that have changed though, so you can edit the `01-HelloWorld` example as much as you want and `build.sh` will only recompile the projects that have changed"
468,2017-08-06T23:25:14.697330,Tameika,i see
468,2017-08-06T23:25:24.698697,Tameika,let me re-do this from scratch
468,2017-08-06T23:26:12.705065,Marcie,no problem! i'm off to the gym so my help will be a bit nonexistant for a while :slightly_smiling_face:
468,2017-08-06T23:26:40.708852,Tameika,ok -- thank you so much!!!

473,2017-08-07T11:14:09.281516,Ciera,what's good with passwordmeter is the list of common password
473,2017-08-07T11:14:17.286369,Ciera,can't do that (easily) with regex
473,2017-08-07T11:15:08.317369,Beula,Good point
473,2017-08-07T11:15:10.317990,Suellen,I wonder if I could dynamically add current username to that list
473,2017-08-07T11:15:20.324358,Suellen,some users really don't care about themselves
473,2017-08-07T11:15:32.332045,Beula,"I would make it a ""rules"" engine myself, test against the regex, test against the username, test against the first/last"
473,2017-08-07T11:15:41.337162,Suellen,"Username: `tommyjones`
Password: `tommyjones1` -- strong"
473,2017-08-07T11:15:43.338539,Beula,test that it's not in the top 100 most common
473,2017-08-07T11:16:37.371251,Ciera,best solution is auto generate password and don't authorise to change (or only regeneration) :smile:
473,2017-08-07T11:17:13.392760,Beula,Or no password and only biometrics
473,2017-08-07T11:17:52.416454,Suellen,not letting users mess with passwords? I love it
473,2017-08-07T11:18:06.424317,Kenna,"If you haven't seen it, NIST recently revised a lot of their password advice, some of the old wisdom seems no longer applies... Troy Hunt had a great writeup on it here <https://www.troyhunt.com/passwords-evolved-authentication-guidance-for-the-modern-era/>"
473,2017-08-07T11:19:03.458383,Kenna,"The TL;DR was something like:

- Stop requiring periodic password changes
- Stop requiring specific formulas of what's okay to use
- Longer is always better and the best way to make passwords strong"
473,2017-08-07T11:19:27.472207,Suellen,&gt; - Longer is always better
473,2017-08-07T11:19:30.473765,Suellen,that's what she...
473,2017-08-07T11:19:31.474421,Tandra,yup and the haveibeenpwned api seems like a very useful tool
473,2017-08-07T11:19:37.478377,Beula,Related is Jeff Atwood's: <https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/>
473,2017-08-07T11:20:03.493272,Suellen,"specific formulas are no-go, alright, but what about suggestions?"
473,2017-08-07T11:20:09.497323,Kenna,"I'm leery of the whole emojis in passwords thing, but maybe I'm just old and emoji newfangled :wink:"
473,2017-08-07T11:20:33.511117,Suellen,"like, ""your password is rated 0.38 (or just ""weak""), and most common ways to impove it are: ..."""
473,2017-08-07T11:21:14.536448,Suellen,"and make a suggestion to add numbers, symbols, increase length. But no checking for specifics, just for a resulting entropy"
473,2017-08-07T11:21:25.543170,Kenna,"<@Suellen> I think the observation was that if you specify a formula, you're telling crackers the formula too. And since humans tend to work similarly it actually gives them a leg up. People tend to put capitals at the start. They tend to put ""special symbols"" and numbers at the end. Etc. If you just leave it free form then it is less likely those predictable patterns emerge"
473,2017-08-07T11:21:55.560516,Suellen,oh
473,2017-08-07T11:22:16.572975,Beula,And they swap in numerals for letters sometimes -&gt; `Password1` -&gt; `P4ssword1`
473,2017-08-07T11:22:25.578361,Suellen,"yeah, that makes sense, and that's exactly what I've been doing before keepass"
473,2017-08-07T11:22:27.579221,Beula,"The lookups are simple, lots of rainbow tables do that"
473,2017-08-07T11:22:51.593916,Beula,"But basically, require a length. For normal users discourse does 10char, for admins 15char"
473,2017-08-07T11:23:07.602967,Kenna,"Where if you make the length arbitrary and encourage longer passwords, it adds a lot of cracking time. The NIST recommendation was to support up to either 128 or 256 char passwords I believe. It specified a minimum of 8, which IMO is probably low, but it's aimed at the average user, so..."
473,2017-08-07T11:23:11.605155,Beula,"and checking agains the 100,000 most common password"
473,2017-08-07T11:23:55.632145,Suellen,"damn, 128"
473,2017-08-07T11:24:05.637735,Gabriele,"It's weird that anyone thought it was a good idea to start demanding special characters, because most people are just going to add 1 of them to meet the requirement, whereas simply making the password longer by a few characters would have a stronger benefit with no effect on how easy it is to remember"
473,2017-08-07T11:24:07.639258,Suellen,holy guacamole
473,2017-08-07T11:24:48.663340,Ciera,256 char passwords ? that require a password manager
473,2017-08-07T11:24:50.664622,Beula,If you want Jeff's suggestions (not the angry rant) -&gt; start here: <https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/#1passwordrulesarebullshit>
473,2017-08-07T11:24:55.668084,Ciera,which is by itself a security risk
473,2017-08-07T11:25:54.703409,Gabriele,I think the idea is _up to_ 256 characters. With most online web apps you can just use a varchar or equivalent
473,2017-08-07T11:26:09.712175,Suellen,good thing postgres doesn't enforce length on varchars
473,2017-08-07T11:26:17.717072,Beula,"Basically:

1. Rules are dumb
2. Enforce a minimum unicode length (emoji -&gt; 1 ""character"" in many length checkers... is the example)
3. Check against the common password (approx 30% of people have a password from the top 10,000)
4. Check of entropy 
5. Check special cases (containing username, first, or last)"
473,2017-08-07T11:26:29.724677,Beula,Just use TEXT with postgres :stuck_out_tongue:
473,2017-08-07T11:26:45.735029,Kenna,"<@Suellen> You hash the password so it gets down to a predictable, probably fixed, length anyway"

473,2017-08-07T11:26:50.737700,Ciera,I store password in JSONB :troll:
473,2017-08-07T11:26:50.737882,Suellen,`varchar` without `max_length` is a `text` as far as pg is concerned
473,2017-08-07T11:26:56.741628,Suellen,so that's good
473,2017-08-07T11:27:36.765864,Beula,"&gt; To sum it all up:
&gt; 
&gt; char(n) – takes too much space when dealing with values shorter than n, and can lead to subtle errors because of adding trailing spaces, plus it is problematic to change the limit
&gt; varchar(n) – it's problematic to change the limit in live environment
&gt; varchar – just like text
&gt; text – for me a winner – over (n) data types because it lacks their problems, and over varchar – because it has distinct name"
473,2017-08-07T11:27:53.775977,Gabriele,"although, why am I even talking about database types, when you shouldn't be storing them in the DB... let me get some more caffeine before I say anything else"
473,2017-08-07T11:28:19.792109,Suellen,oh oh
473,2017-08-07T11:28:36.802703,Kenna,"<@Ciera> NSCS/GCHQ (UK) is officially recommending password managers now, also mentioned in Troy's post"
473,2017-08-07T11:28:59.816484,Suellen,"btw, since there's a great discussion going on: is bcrypt still good enough?"
473,2017-08-07T11:29:26.832567,Ciera,<@Kenna> because they have access to them ? :troll:
473,2017-08-07T11:29:52.848444,Ciera,am sure they are good but it's still a problem if someone get access to it

473,2017-08-07T11:30:13.861584,Ciera,(even more in companies where you can just do a dump before get fired / leaving)

473,2017-08-07T11:32:06.932475,Beula,`bcrypt` seems to be the standard still in most places
473,2017-08-07T11:33:07.970401,Suellen,did you hear the sad story of scrypt? it's not the story infosec people would tell you...
473,2017-08-07T11:41:03.258281,Suellen,"it was invented and named ""better bcrypt"", but wasn't used much"
473,2017-08-07T11:41:38.278552,Suellen,and starting to use scrypt now wouldn't make much sense because of argon2
473,2017-08-07T11:43:10.333444,Beula,I was just looking through the django docs on what they use by default - and they suggest argon2 as well
473,2017-08-07T11:43:45.354740,Suellen,oh cool
473,2017-08-07T11:44:02.364917,Suellen,"wait, is there a python implementation / bindings?"
473,2017-08-07T11:44:58.398887,Suellen,"I searched for it, but only found a lonely github repo and it wasn't updated much"
473,2017-08-07T11:45:25.415169,Suellen,`argon2_cffi`
473,2017-08-07T11:46:58.470692,Beula,Looks like that's the one they link to as well: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/auth/passwords/#using-argon2-with-django>

473,2017-08-07T11:47:49.501023,Beula,"&gt; . The Password Hashing Competition panel, however, recommends immediate use of Argon2 rather than the other algorithms supported by Django."
474,2017-08-07T11:37:57.148463,Meg,what went on with scrypt?
475,2017-08-07T15:02:11.920167,Meghan,"Saw the password stuff from earlier. So much of the web, and business, is doing passwords so wrong. If there is a length limitation it is scary, because length doesn't matter much if it is hashed anyway."
475,2017-08-07T15:04:04.980438,Meg,or you're dealing with a crappy legacy system
475,2017-08-07T15:04:13.984780,Meg,and/or clueless management
475,2017-08-07T15:04:40.999380,Beula,"Length does matter with hashing, each additional character increases the hash entropy significantly - as far as I understand it"
475,2017-08-07T15:04:48.003836,Beula,Sure the end hash is the same length
475,2017-08-07T15:04:50.004693,Meghan,I meant with storage.
475,2017-08-07T15:04:53.006175,Beula,Ah

475,2017-08-07T15:05:31.025887,Suellen,emojis are a must nowadays
475,2017-08-07T15:06:17.049300,Meghan,I think KeePass can be set to generate passwords with ascii characters that aren't on a keyboard.

479,2017-08-08T07:55:33.805269,Tandra,set another field to be your primary key explicitly sounds like what you're after
479,2017-08-08T07:56:10.816578,Verlie,i didn't get you can you say clearly
479,2017-08-08T07:58:04.853917,Verlie,we can put another key is primary Autofields not working
479,2017-08-08T07:58:31.863028,Verlie,we can put another field is primary Autofields not working
479,2017-08-08T07:58:54.870513,Tandra,"all models require one field to be a primary key, how exactly are you trying to use the autofield?"
479,2017-08-08T07:59:25.880894,Tandra,is this going to be your primary key because if so then it should be set as true not false
479,2017-08-08T08:00:06.895011,Tandra,if it's not going to be your primary key then set another field as the primary_key=True but remove the false from autofield
479,2017-08-08T08:00:41.907890,Tandra,the error is just saying it cannot be false
479,2017-08-08T08:00:47.910370,Tandra,which is correct
479,2017-08-08T08:01:24.923592,Tandra,"read the link i pasted, it explains it much clearer tbh"
479,2017-08-08T08:02:10.939484,Verlie,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37709163/how-can-i-support-autofieldprimary-key-false-in-django>
479,2017-08-08T08:02:45.951680,Verlie,i go throw this link but its not working
479,2017-08-08T08:05:06.999363,Tandra,"because you are using autofield django assumes you don't need to use it's built in primary key, create another field for id and set it to primary key whilst keeping your original non primary key, assuming thats what you meant"
479,2017-08-08T08:05:30.008074,Meg,"also, you may need to manually delete the pk index for the table"
479,2017-08-08T08:05:39.011124,Meg,can’t remember if migrations will do that for you
479,2017-08-08T08:06:12.022522,Verlie,any sample code for how to do
479,2017-08-08T08:06:22.026251,Verlie,i am new to Django
479,2017-08-08T08:07:44.054357,Meg,add a new field to the model class
479,2017-08-08T08:07:59.059283,Meg,with `primary_key = True`
479,2017-08-08T08:08:11.063111,Meg,delete `primary_key = True` from the autofield
479,2017-08-08T08:08:14.064311,Meg,run migrations
479,2017-08-08T08:08:20.066523,Meg,apply migrations
479,2017-08-08T08:09:28.089761,Verlie,id = models.AutoField()
479,2017-08-08T08:09:44.095183,Tandra,"this doesn't seem like anything that is worth doing imo, both field will contain the same values, whats wrong with just using the default PK field?"
479,2017-08-08T08:09:56.099295,Meg,good question
479,2017-08-08T08:10:09.103757,Verlie,"first_name = models.CharField(max_length=15, primary_key = True)"
479,2017-08-08T08:10:14.105540,Verlie,like this only
479,2017-08-08T08:10:45.116568,Meg,_not_ a good idea
479,2017-08-08T08:10:51.118796,Meg,because a primary key needs to be unique
479,2017-08-08T08:11:09.125321,Meg,thats why its typically an integer or UUID
479,2017-08-08T08:11:36.135550,Meg,_why_ do you want the PK to be for the first name?
479,2017-08-08T08:12:04.145531,Verlie,"cuid = models.AutoField(primary_key=False)
    cust_id = ""CUS"" + str(cuid)      (i want this field is primary_key)"
479,2017-08-08T08:13:15.170340,Tandra,"the AutoField seems moot here, so does the cust_id field"
479,2017-08-08T08:13:52.182566,Verlie,ya in cust_id we concatinating string and id
479,2017-08-08T08:14:15.190564,Meg,_why_?
479,2017-08-08T08:14:21.192336,Tandra,"if this is not gonna be readable by whoever is using it, just use the built in PK field"
479,2017-08-08T08:14:55.204355,Tandra,a simple integer as a unique identifier seems much simpler
479,2017-08-08T08:15:09.209505,Meg,don’t make things more complex than you need to
479,2017-08-08T08:15:19.213245,Verlie,i want  cust_id field as primary_key and  cuid field is Autofield
479,2017-08-08T08:15:27.216310,Tandra,"if you specifically need a str + unique id, still use the built in pk field and concat the name and id in another field"
479,2017-08-08T08:15:53.225591,Tandra,keeping it simple works wonders :slightly_smiling_face:
479,2017-08-08T08:16:56.248775,Verlie,can you plese write code related to what i am asking that way
479,2017-08-08T08:17:09.253255,Meg,because you are going about it the wrong way
479,2017-08-08T08:17:36.263022,Verlie,here i apply inherritance
479,2017-08-08T08:17:39.264063,Meg,and what you’re trying to do is complex and unnecessary by any application of good practices
479,2017-08-08T08:18:18.277623,Verlie,i am inherritting some classes that why i dint want id is primary_key
479,2017-08-08T08:23:41.396182,Meg,that doesn’t make any sense
479,2017-08-08T08:23:54.400966,Meg,"because when you inherit a model, you don’t inherit the id of the other model class"
479,2017-08-08T08:25:39.440295,Verlie,but default it generate id on other classes
479,2017-08-08T08:37:27.720069,Danille,<@Ciera> is it better to use Flask?)
479,2017-08-08T08:47:20.969087,Meg,sounds like you and <@Beula> have similar Ruby love :slightly_smiling_face:
479,2017-08-08T09:04:41.449081,Meg,"apparently so, genie"

479,2017-08-08T09:09:12.582060,Meg,"so you don’t bust out in moves, you break them completely?"
479,2017-08-08T09:10:38.625201,Vada,I think it is telling that the ruby dancce looks like someone crying
479,2017-08-08T09:11:15.643752,Beula,"Agreed, very insightful! "
480,2017-08-08T08:29:23.526298,Danille,"^ Sorry for wrapping text in snippet, but its still readable i think.."

480,2017-08-08T08:38:08.736195,Ciera,they are very different. there is not a better one. It depends what your goal is
480,2017-08-08T08:40:05.783295,Danille,"<@Ciera> Yeah, I know. Django has batteries, i thought.. But turns out that there is a lot of unnecessary complexity for my tasks. Maybe I just don’t understand it :slightly_smiling_face:"
480,2017-08-08T08:40:57.804380,Meg,"conversely, flask doesn’t have many batteries"
480,2017-08-08T08:41:07.808764,Ciera,I'm not a django expert but yeah django can be a bit heavy for some tasks
480,2017-08-08T08:41:07.808765,Meg,"but requires a greater level of understanding, I feel"
480,2017-08-08T08:41:13.811136,Ciera,:point_up:
480,2017-08-08T08:41:32.818729,Meg,"if you’re familiar with web dev, django is pretty analogous to angular"
480,2017-08-08T08:41:37.820958,Meg,and flask with react/vue
480,2017-08-08T08:46:17.941610,Danille,For web I wrote only a small ROR project and it is was a nightmare compare to django’s “magic” :slightly_smiling_face:

481,2017-08-08T09:49:13.898114,Mendy,Anyone have any issues with the latest requests package and connecting to SSL?
481,2017-08-08T09:49:41.915572,Mendy,"I.e., requests.get('<https://www.google.com>') gets a CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED error?"
481,2017-08-08T09:50:39.950922,Mendy,"On an EC2 instance (RHCE) I get this with a clean venv with the latest requests (2.18.3), but not with a clean venv with a slightly older one (2.13)"
481,2017-08-08T09:50:56.961006,Mendy,"But on my Mac, clean venv with the latest requests work"
481,2017-08-08T09:51:14.971734,Mendy,Really weird
481,2017-08-08T09:53:32.056208,Ciera,It's working on my ubuntu laptop with `2.18.3`
481,2017-08-08T09:53:51.067254,Mendy,"Yeah, like it said it's fine on my Mac"
481,2017-08-08T09:54:05.075669,Ciera,maybe certificates that needs updating ?
481,2017-08-08T09:54:17.083511,Mendy,Python on the EC2 is 2.7.5
481,2017-08-08T09:54:23.087105,Mendy,It uses certifi for the certs
481,2017-08-08T09:54:27.089522,Tandra,is it not a case of google's anti botting ?
481,2017-08-08T09:54:40.097049,Mendy,And I tested the cert file with openssl on the command line and it worked
481,2017-08-08T09:54:59.108921,Mendy,"I.e., it has a fresh cert file packaged - it doesn't use the system cert"
481,2017-08-08T09:55:19.121688,Ciera,does curl work ?
481,2017-08-08T09:55:41.135311,Mendy,<@Tandra> Don't know why that would only affect the newer version and only on the EC2 instance
481,2017-08-08T09:55:58.146119,Mendy,<@Ciera> Let me try
481,2017-08-08T09:56:13.155605,Tandra,if the ip has hit the url too many times it could potentially lock it out is what i meant
481,2017-08-08T09:56:18.158789,Mendy,But openssl AND slightly older requests work
481,2017-08-08T09:56:19.159841,Tandra,hence why it works elsewhere
481,2017-08-08T09:56:46.176855,Ciera,for a request to google homepage I think you should hit it pretty hard to be locked out
481,2017-08-08T09:56:51.179799,Mendy,Yeah
481,2017-08-08T09:56:59.184773,Mendy,Curl works
481,2017-08-08T09:57:28.202436,Ciera,well so I guess it's something in `requests`
481,2017-08-08T09:57:30.203554,Mendy,Need to figure out how to get more info
481,2017-08-08T09:57:37.208318,Ciera,I would try with newer python and open an issue :slightly_smiling_face:
481,2017-08-08T09:57:46.213677,Mendy,"Need the raw request, I guess"
481,2017-08-08T09:58:25.238192,Mendy,Going to see if I can dump the full request
481,2017-08-08T09:58:29.240553,Meg,can you update to newer python?
481,2017-08-08T09:58:46.251264,Meg,"I mean, 2.7.5 _is_ fairly old"
481,2017-08-08T09:58:50.253866,Mendy,Yeah
481,2017-08-08T09:58:51.254250,Ciera,try to up the log level
481,2017-08-08T09:59:20.272639,Ciera,requests is supporting 2.6 so it should work
481,2017-08-08T09:59:41.286299,Suellen,probs related: <https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/issues/52>
481,2017-08-08T10:00:13.306754,Suellen,`requests` updated their `certifi` dependency @ version 2.14 (after working 2.13)
481,2017-08-08T10:01:21.352655,Mendy,"Oooh, missed that issue"
481,2017-08-08T10:03:14.425517,Mendy,"Yeah, my openssl is 1.0.1"
481,2017-08-08T10:03:19.428784,Mendy,Thanks!
481,2017-08-08T10:05:04.494569,Meg,that would do it :slightly_smiling_face:
481,2017-08-08T10:13:03.794614,Mendy,"Yeah, that did it"
482,2017-08-08T10:16:50.940266,Suellen,yay :tada:

483,2017-08-08T12:51:47.945844,Suellen,"<@Danille> you should always store and use UTC everywhere, up until you need to present the datetime to users"
483,2017-08-08T12:51:54.949959,Suellen,at this point it should be in their locale
483,2017-08-08T12:52:55.986281,Beula,I commented on that in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> - there is some slight overlap in the subjects
483,2017-08-08T12:54:54.057195,Suellen,I'm not subscribed to that channel :confused:
483,2017-08-08T12:55:08.066443,Beula,I should have suggested they keep it in one spot - my bad

483,2017-08-08T13:04:12.399424,Beula,Agreed with <@Collette> . PyCharm is the most feature filled - but that may hinder learning
483,2017-08-08T13:04:34.412569,Ela,best place to start learning the python language is <http://python.org|python.org>?
483,2017-08-08T13:04:43.417908,Johana,i think the way it helps enforce styles and auto-completion is useful.
483,2017-08-08T13:05:02.428584,Johana,i started with an IDE and i’ve done a number of other things w/o it and have been fine.
483,2017-08-08T13:07:07.501478,Johana,“best” is a rather subjective term but i really liked the google 2 day class.
483,2017-08-08T13:07:55.529437,Johana,you might also like codeacademy. it’s interactive and in the browser.
483,2017-08-08T13:08:39.555087,Johana,the only thing about the google 2 day class is they use 2 spaces instead of 4. I didn’t follow that but as long as you’re consistent your fine.

483,2017-08-08T13:18:36.902982,Orpha,<http://pythonlearn.com/> ?
483,2017-08-08T13:18:41.906022,Johana,ya
483,2017-08-08T13:18:49.911235,Beula,So far only a few of us have been pretty active on the <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> - others come and go and add a little bit as they have time
483,2017-08-08T13:19:02.918829,Orpha,its the site for a coursera class
483,2017-08-08T13:19:11.923472,Orpha,python for everyone
483,2017-08-08T13:19:16.926800,Johana,ah i see the MOOC link
483,2017-08-08T13:19:18.927969,Orpha,or something like that
483,2017-08-08T13:19:29.934565,Orpha,but he updated it from py2 to py3
483,2017-08-08T13:19:45.943455,Johana,i think this is what a couple ppl from work are doing.
483,2017-08-08T13:19:45.943525,Orpha,"and i added foundation to his site, it looks bad now, but it was way worse haha"
483,2017-08-08T13:20:43.978097,Orpha,i haven’t actually taken the course
483,2017-08-08T13:20:47.980698,Orpha,i took a different one
483,2017-08-08T13:21:12.995402,Johana,"nice license on his stuff too:

&gt; Note to people teaching Python: These materials are Copyright Creattive Commons Attribution 2.5. You are welcome to use these in your courses any way you like. You can make copies and host them yourselves if you like."
483,2017-08-08T13:21:12.995699,Orpha,but… hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken it
483,2017-08-08T13:21:41.012801,Orpha,"yea, and his book has been translated to many other languages from what i remember"
483,2017-08-08T13:22:52.054591,Johana,i like the intro to his book. i have an interest in this so its cool to see the different ways ppl start out their “why you should learn programming” introductions.
483,2017-08-08T13:23:01.060052,Winnifred,The Coursera Rice Sponsored Python track was good.
483,2017-08-08T13:23:07.063251,Winnifred,If that hasn’t been mentioned already.
483,2017-08-08T13:23:14.067852,Johana,o wait.. that’s probably the one ppl are doing at work.
483,2017-08-08T13:23:31.077625,Johana,i know it’s on coursera.
483,2017-08-08T13:23:45.085491,Johana,our director has a course on there too for signal processing.
483,2017-08-08T13:24:08.099532,Winnifred,I took that track 4 years ago and it was great if you dedicate the time.
483,2017-08-08T13:24:19.105718,Johana,i know b/c we use a lot of his seed data for experiments :wink:.
483,2017-08-08T13:24:41.119472,Johana,i did the edx MIT 6.0.0.1 and 2 course.
483,2017-08-08T13:24:47.122829,Orpha,<https://github.com/csev/py4e>
483,2017-08-08T13:25:01.131084,Orpha,^ the repo for everything related to that course
483,2017-08-08T13:27:52.233309,Johana,this one starts in AUG <https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11?utm_source=OCW&amp;utm_medium=CHP&amp;utm_campaign=OCW>
483,2017-08-08T13:28:10.243952,Johana,the instructor is awesome. he also has a python textbook.
483,2017-08-08T13:28:40.262229,Johana,"however, i like the coursera interface more than edx."
483,2017-08-08T13:29:23.288304,Johana,SO MANY CHOICES !!!
483,2017-08-08T13:29:52.305219,Tandra,the edx interface reminds me of them clickbait links with 30 pictures each on seperate pages :neutral_face:
483,2017-08-08T13:30:10.316718,Orpha,lol
483,2017-08-08T13:30:14.319002,Beula,Looks like we have some new ideas for our learning-resources repo
484,2017-08-08T13:02:39.343496,Ela,"Hi, what's the best python IDE for a newbie?"
485,2017-08-08T13:10:04.604440,Danille,<@Suellen> thank u!
486,2017-08-08T14:11:14.834249,Johana,"yea, i’ll PR a few of these in."
486,2017-08-08T14:19:11.116813,Orpha,I'm also hoping to finish writing this book on flask. <#C3GFPUBGF|shameless_plug> 
486,2017-08-08T14:21:26.197593,Johana,nice you have a flask book? you going to compete with the good ol’ miguel grinberg.
486,2017-08-08T14:21:43.207120,Orpha,Likely not. lol
486,2017-08-08T14:21:54.214183,Orpha,My book is pretty niche 
486,2017-08-08T14:22:08.222165,Orpha,Sort of a how to put flask into production 
486,2017-08-08T14:22:39.241175,Johana,yea i had my own ideas in that area too. we’ll have stuff for the community at some point.
486,2017-08-08T14:22:50.247632,Orpha,Nice 
486,2017-08-08T14:37:19.780743,Johana,i got an email about this today. it seems pretty good.
486,2017-08-08T14:37:20.781458,Johana,<http://python101.pythonlibrary.org/>
486,2017-08-08T14:38:03.807914,Meghan,"That book does look good. I got a free copy when he gave it away on Reddit last year, and have bookmarked the link since he posted it online for free now."
486,2017-08-08T14:38:16.815761,Johana,haha i did the free copy thing too.
486,2017-08-08T14:38:41.830734,Meghan,"That may have been how I ended up using ConfigObj for everything, I think."
486,2017-08-08T14:39:23.855371,Johana,soooo many free resources. that’s why i’m shocked when ppl pay for classes and they are learning on their own.
486,2017-08-08T14:39:39.865236,Meghan,I know. And so many of the classes are outdated or poorly done.
486,2017-08-08T14:39:59.876558,Johana,for work i can see being sent to some training.
486,2017-08-08T14:40:01.877983,Meghan,"I've been doing this for 18 months, I think, and that book still has things I've not done."
486,2017-08-08T14:44:54.052986,Tandra,"humblebookbundle recently did a bunch of python books, can't wait to get stuck into them. the resources for learning are pretty awesome"
486,2017-08-08T14:49:10.206347,Orpha,"i really liked violent python, but it was in python-2.x"
486,2017-08-08T14:51:38.295695,Tandra,"i have that but haven't read it yet, does it matter if it's py2 specific?"
486,2017-08-08T14:51:45.299294,Johana,these days it isn’t a stretch to go py2 to py3
486,2017-08-08T14:51:55.305233,Tandra,thats what i was thinking too
487,2017-08-08T16:48:51.257858,Bruno,anyone here deploying docker containers on aws in production? curious how you're doing it. theres different ways.
488,2017-08-08T17:00:07.627008,Orpha,its not too bad. it would just be nice to copy code directly and see it work.
488,2017-08-08T17:00:30.640004,Orpha,its actually not a problem for me at all
488,2017-08-08T17:00:37.643671,Orpha,ill still code in 2.x
488,2017-08-08T17:00:51.651597,Orpha,im slowly starting to write more 3.x now
488,2017-08-08T17:01:33.674806,Orpha,"but every time i tell <@Bruno> i got a new book, the first thing he asks is if its py2 or py3"
488,2017-08-08T17:02:39.710246,Bruno,lol. mostly because of how stubborn you used to be on using 2. so now its more habit and amusing.
488,2017-08-08T17:03:03.722823,Orpha,lol
488,2017-08-08T17:03:38.741719,Orpha,back when i was mostly webscraping using urllib.. i didn’t like that i had to decode it in 3
488,2017-08-08T17:03:45.745778,Bruno,you should just write your own version of that book in python 3 (with async of course) and make it forward compatible with python 4
488,2017-08-08T17:04:01.754210,Orpha,no
488,2017-08-08T17:04:03.755353,Orpha,lol
488,2017-08-08T17:04:39.774031,Orpha,im gonna be just as stubborn about py4 (wtf is that) and async as i was about py2
488,2017-08-08T17:04:41.775414,Orpha,lol
488,2017-08-08T17:04:53.781156,Tandra,is there a big thing between py2 and 3 still?
488,2017-08-08T17:05:33.802188,Orpha,"as far as i know, just a differences in the imports / things being bytes instead of strings"
488,2017-08-08T17:05:35.802997,Bruno,not as much anymore.
488,2017-08-08T17:06:09.820154,Bruno,theres more differences underneath. but most arent too much of an issue. unless you are Zed Shaw
488,2017-08-08T17:06:11.821545,Orpha,"also, isn’t 3.6 when lists and dicts were ordered?"
488,2017-08-08T17:06:18.825113,Bruno,yes
488,2017-08-08T17:06:34.833329,Tandra,"i read the zed shaw stuff, he sounds a bit crazy imo tbh"
488,2017-08-08T17:06:38.835681,Beula,"dicts, lists are always ordered"
488,2017-08-08T17:06:40.836193,Bruno,there were _technically_ ordered before. it just wasnt garanteed
488,2017-08-08T17:06:44.838188,Ciera,yeah but better not based your code on that
488,2017-08-08T17:06:59.846612,Orpha,^ thats what i meant
488,2017-08-08T17:07:03.848336,Ciera,it's now garanteed but subject to change as it's an implementation detail
488,2017-08-08T17:07:03.848515,Bruno,yea you shouldnt
488,2017-08-08T17:07:09.851472,Bruno,yea
488,2017-08-08T17:07:15.854443,Ciera,i don't know if they are in PyPi
488,2017-08-08T17:07:21.857222,Bruno,yes they are
488,2017-08-08T17:07:29.861135,Bruno,thats where they got the new code from
488,2017-08-08T17:07:30.861945,Tandra,would there ever be a reason for it to be unordered ?
488,2017-08-08T17:07:40.866323,Bruno,they stoled it
488,2017-08-08T17:07:40.866703,Tandra,seems like a step backwards if that ever happens
488,2017-08-08T17:07:40.866728,Ciera,speed I guess
488,2017-08-08T17:07:56.874407,Tandra,speed should never matter though surly?
488,2017-08-08T17:07:59.875791,Bruno,i think it was still an improvement if I recall
488,2017-08-08T17:08:17.884848,Ciera,dict speed is pretty important as almost everything is a dict in python
488,2017-08-08T17:08:30.890891,Orpha,it was always weird when id pull a random out of a list
488,2017-08-08T17:08:32.892043,Bruno,since they changed other things or how part of the algorithm worked. i think.
488,2017-08-08T17:08:38.895350,Ciera,it was an improvement but I'm talking about the future
488,2017-08-08T17:08:58.905115,Bruno,yea
488,2017-08-08T17:08:59.905468,Ciera,maybe someone will find a new algorithm much faster but that isn't ordered
488,2017-08-08T17:09:00.905532,Beula,3.6 has a ton of dict improvements!
488,2017-08-08T17:09:20.915335,Bruno,yup.
488,2017-08-08T17:09:20.915453,Ciera,yeah there are great talks from raymond hettinger about them
488,2017-08-08T17:09:38.923988,Bruno,"they got a lot from pypy too. so hopefully, it will help them catch up faster"
488,2017-08-08T17:09:43.926419,Ciera,if you are on 3.5 no reason to not use 3.6
488,2017-08-08T17:09:58.933591,Bruno,hettinger has a lot of good talks anyways
488,2017-08-08T17:10:12.939977,Ciera,with their funding pypi is improving a lot their python 3 support
488,2017-08-08T17:10:22.945275,Bruno,yea. thanks to Mozilla.
488,2017-08-08T17:10:37.952400,Bruno,they got intitial 3.5 support super fast
488,2017-08-08T17:10:39.953601,Beula,That's a company I would love to work with
488,2017-08-08T17:10:44.955814,Bruno,same.
488,2017-08-08T17:10:59.963204,Ciera,yeah but not sure it's financially stable enough
488,2017-08-08T17:11:19.973188,Bruno,"i have heard redhat is nice to work for too. i technically applied recently, but never heard anything."
488,2017-08-08T17:11:36.980930,Bruno,i dont think it is yet
488,2017-08-08T17:11:37.981596,Ciera,working on ansible :smile:
488,2017-08-08T17:11:37.981755,Beula,Mozilla has millions annually just for featuring Yahoo as the default search engine
488,2017-08-08T17:11:51.988414,Bruno,heh
488,2017-08-08T17:11:58.991398,Ciera,yeah but it's all based on donation. It can stop at any time
488,2017-08-08T17:12:05.994816,Bruno,what % of yahoos income is that. lol
488,2017-08-08T17:12:21.002495,Beula,I think that one is contractually obligated for 7 years
488,2017-08-08T17:12:33.008092,Bruno,its been a few years already
488,2017-08-08T17:13:44.041340,Elanor,this in C I need for Pyhton
488,2017-08-08T17:14:49.072276,Bruno,i have no clue. im not a C guy.
488,2017-08-08T17:15:27.090913,Tandra,i could guess but i won't
488,2017-08-08T17:16:35.123211,Orpha,<https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html>
488,2017-08-08T17:16:59.134244,Orpha,^ you could always just use the c code
488,2017-08-08T17:19:20.200731,Beula,"You need to provide more context <@Elanor> , with what you've shown there is next to no context"
488,2017-08-08T17:20:09.223391,Elanor,"I don't have any headers imported in Python , I only import shared libraries"
488,2017-08-08T17:20:43.238966,Beula,That's context :wink:
488,2017-08-08T17:20:43.238976,Elanor,In C++ the headers name is SDK
488,2017-08-08T17:21:17.255160,Elanor,I'm calling function from this shared library
488,2017-08-08T17:22:04.277233,Elanor,The Share Library is already done by another person I Import it in Python and I need to use some function calls
488,2017-08-08T17:22:29.288653,Elanor,"he told me to use extern , but I don't know what that mean in Python"
488,2017-08-08T17:22:55.300476,Bruno,can you point to the source of the library so we know what sdk is?
488,2017-08-08T17:23:09.306668,Bruno,i think thats what he needs
488,2017-08-08T17:26:46.405633,Orpha,this sounds like you need to import the .so into python and call a function right?
488,2017-08-08T17:29:32.484025,Elanor,If I can get the source I will provide it to you
488,2017-08-08T17:31:08.531182,Beula,<https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html>
488,2017-08-08T17:31:25.538634,Bruno,"well, the name doesnt mean much. we need to know what it does in C in order to do similar in python."
488,2017-08-08T17:32:14.561674,Beula,"I don't think they are trying to recreate it in Python, I think they want to use the shared lib from python"
488,2017-08-08T17:33:08.586159,Elanor,No what I'm going to do in Python just Functuon Calls
488,2017-08-08T17:59:55.289567,Beula,"We did Mesos, so using an orchestration system"
488,2017-08-08T18:00:08.295668,Bruno,"ah. yea, rancher came to mind too."
488,2017-08-08T18:00:14.297976,Bruno,i havent touched mesos
488,2017-08-08T18:01:24.328742,Beula,"Kubernetes, Mesos, Rancher, Swarm - take your pick :slightly_smiling_face:"
488,2017-08-08T18:01:37.334118,Bruno,the place im trying to get an interview with i guess is using docker with aws.
488,2017-08-08T18:01:53.340634,Beula,Everywhere seems to say that these days :wink:
488,2017-08-08T18:02:13.348875,Bruno,or they want to. or something.
488,2017-08-08T18:02:18.351190,Bruno,yea
488,2017-08-08T18:23:34.819597,Beula,"<@Laverne> Two came up today that are good:

* <http://python101.pythonlibrary.org/index.html>"
488,2017-08-08T18:24:04.829803,Lamonica,not sure about the book but at least the web uses python 3: <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter1/>
488,2017-08-08T18:24:07.830781,Beula,That's the link I was trying to get :slightly_smiling_face:
489,2017-08-08T17:13:28.033665,Elanor,"Hi guys , what is the equivalent of   
extern Sdk*  Sdk_new2(const char * ip);"
489,2017-08-08T17:18:40.182324,Elanor,what you mean in that?
489,2017-08-08T17:19:35.207288,Beula,"Depending on what headers are imported, Sdk could be anything"
489,2017-08-08T17:20:10.223870,Elanor,.so
489,2017-08-08T17:20:40.237529,Beula,"Okay, so what shared object libraries?"
489,2017-08-08T17:21:20.256602,Elanor,in Linxu
489,2017-08-08T17:21:22.257793,Beula,"Is this python C-extension specific, or something else?"
489,2017-08-08T17:29:13.475073,Elanor,yes
489,2017-08-08T17:29:57.496638,Elanor,but the function Name is Sdk_new2
489,2017-08-08T17:30:42.518337,Elanor,and SDK is the Main class name
489,2017-08-08T17:30:53.523798,Elanor,in C++
489,2017-08-08T17:31:07.530760,Beula,Sounds like you could benefit from CFFI
489,2017-08-08T17:32:21.564758,Beula,CFFI is the easiest way IIRC
489,2017-08-08T17:32:45.575659,Elanor,I will take a look
489,2017-08-08T17:32:47.576917,Bruno,ah yea. i was thinking wrong.
489,2017-08-08T17:59:31.279097,Bruno,may have gotten lost above. but looking to see how others may be deploying docker on aws. either their container service or beanstalk or something else.

491,2017-08-08T21:37:22.853625,Tameika,cross posting here -- <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45576378/boost-python-library-linking-issue-undefined-symbol/45578139?noredirect=1#comment78117846_45578139>
491,2017-08-08T22:26:05.441689,Steve,should I only ask questions in here if I have them?
491,2017-08-08T22:31:48.506290,Marcie,"<@Steve> this is typically a place for generic python questions or if there isnt a more specific place to ask your question if it's about a particular library or topic (such as <#C0LMFRMB5|django>, <#C07EYDP25|webdev>, <#C2J4B66PK|machine_learning>, etc.)"
491,2017-08-08T22:36:40.559996,Steve,cool thanks
492,2017-08-09T01:36:24.926101,Tameika,if you have 3 files as follows : `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python-py27.so  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python-py34.so  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libboost_python.so`
492,2017-08-09T01:36:53.931168,Tameika,How do I link the `libboost_python-py34.so`to `-lboost_python`?
493,2017-08-09T08:29:17.544801,Lanita,"Hm, how terrible of an idea is it to use classes as a sort of symbol, instead of using an enum?

Something like this:

```
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    class Symbol: pass
    class State(Symbol): pass
    class FireTheMissiles(State): pass
    class WaitAround(State): pass

    def perform_action(action: State) -&gt; None:
        if action is FireTheMissiles:
            print(""On!"")
        elif action is WaitAround:
            print(""Off!"")
        else:
            raise Exception(""Unhandled action '{}'"".format(action.__name__))

    perform_action(FireTheMissiles)
```"
493,2017-08-09T08:30:46.578385,Lanita,Stringly typed functions suck and there's no native symbols type AFAIK(?)
493,2017-08-09T08:30:47.578684,Collette,"<@Lanita> your conditions are all wrong. `if isinstance(action, FireTheMissiles)` is the correct one"
493,2017-08-09T08:31:33.596337,Lanita,"<@Collette>, no, I'm not instantiating the State classes"
493,2017-08-09T08:32:51.626345,Lanita,"Let's make it like this or something:

```
    class Symbol:
        def __init__(self):
            raise Exception(""Shouldn't be instantiated!"")
```

...to make sure that nobody tries instantiating the symbols"
493,2017-08-09T08:33:47.648436,Lanita,a bit like how None is not callable
493,2017-08-09T08:34:15.659631,Collette,`def perform_action(action: State)` declaration means that `action` is an instance of `State` :slightly_smiling_face:
493,2017-08-09T08:34:43.671006,Lanita,"Ah, sorry, yes. Hm, is there a way to signify a non-instantiated class?"
493,2017-08-09T08:35:32.690615,Lanita,type(WaitAround) is `&lt;class 'type'&gt;` so I guess that'd be weird...
493,2017-08-09T08:35:40.693710,Ciera,why use a class for that and not a string or whatever ?
493,2017-08-09T08:36:17.708252,Lanita,"ovv, an error in stringly typed code won't be detected until runtime"
493,2017-08-09T08:36:33.714702,Collette,"It's `Type[State]`, but I'd go with enums"
493,2017-08-09T08:36:35.715461,Lanita,"with this, you would have some file symbols.py where you'd import all the ""symbols"" you're using"
493,2017-08-09T08:37:43.741853,Ciera,is there no way to add type check for string in a list or something like that in mypy ?
493,2017-08-09T08:37:52.745514,Ciera,jsut asking as I have nerver used it
493,2017-08-09T08:40:42.815772,Lanita,"Ah, now I remember, the problem with enum is that until 3.6 there was no built-in way to automatically generate enums. Also, the syntax in 3.6 is really ugly either way"
493,2017-08-09T08:41:26.834001,Collette,Ugly? What's a better syntax?
493,2017-08-09T08:42:13.853410,Lanita,"ah, after looking at it, Enum seems like a much better choice"
493,2017-08-09T08:42:48.868227,Lanita,"malinoff, having one auto() for every new possible value is really ugly"
493,2017-08-09T08:43:38.888859,Lanita,The syntax is clearly a compromise for python not having proper enums to begin with
493,2017-08-09T08:48:30.011550,Lanita,"maybe something like...

sym FIRE_THE_MISSILES
sym WAIT_AROUND
StateEnum = SymbolCollection(""StateEnum"", FIRE_THE_MISSILES, WAIT_AROUND)

(assuming that this was implemented way earlier, of course). This would allow symbols ""on their own"" as well as a collection of symbols. Perhaps that might as well be a list though, it really depends on how you're using enums to begin with"
493,2017-08-09T09:10:00.608057,Gabriele,I vaguely recall using `WHATEVER = object()` in the past for this sort of purpose
494,2017-08-09T09:11:34.654604,Beula,Enum is new in 3.4

495,2017-08-09T12:47:34.827987,Ressie,but the target for this is Linux at the end of the day i think

495,2017-08-09T12:48:42.867987,Suellen,yes!
495,2017-08-09T12:48:55.875468,Suellen,I haven't even thought about it

495,2017-08-09T12:53:21.034521,Ressie,yeah i got traffic now but i did not get the route print
495,2017-08-09T12:53:44.047884,Suellen,is `-R` present?
495,2017-08-09T12:53:50.051481,Ressie,indeed
495,2017-08-09T12:54:01.058073,Ressie,and this is internal IP will do a route print

495,2017-08-09T12:54:11.064284,Ressie,i verified in the term
495,2017-08-09T12:54:36.079361,Suellen,does OS X's ping support that flag? :slightly_smiling_face:
495,2017-08-09T12:54:41.082391,Ressie,it does
495,2017-08-09T12:54:47.086311,Suellen,oh :confused:
495,2017-08-09T12:55:05.097235,Ressie,yeah i can not provide you with the output but it does work
495,2017-08-09T12:55:15.102924,Ressie,since this is deep inside a private network
495,2017-08-09T12:55:17.104265,Ressie,but it does work
495,2017-08-09T12:55:21.107235,Ressie,the command does print back
495,2017-08-09T12:56:08.135418,Suellen,but not the route?

496,2017-08-09T13:42:13.798099,Meg,"you need to define `test_software`, etc inside `class_unit_test.setUp`"
496,2017-08-09T13:42:36.811916,Meg,because the unit test instanciates the class
496,2017-08-09T13:42:49.819355,Meg,"so anything you do outside it, in the context of a unit test, will not exist"
496,2017-08-09T13:43:13.833444,Meg,"in other words, use `setUp` to define variables you need for the test"
496,2017-08-09T13:43:33.845554,Meg,"also, you need better naming for your class and variables"
496,2017-08-09T13:44:13.870295,Ok,And do i need to define multiple fuctions 
496,2017-08-09T13:44:26.878405,Meg,one test method for each piece you test
496,2017-08-09T13:45:23.912844,Ok,Okay

498,2017-08-10T07:50:24.150861,Maida,Can anybody kindly point me in the right direction?
498,2017-08-10T07:50:34.153866,Ciera,Hi you might have better luck asking in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> :slightly_smiling_face:
499,2017-08-10T10:43:37.426659,Ciera,Anyone as an idea how to skip some unittest on older python version when it trigger a syntax error ?
499,2017-08-10T10:51:26.742800,Meghan,"Could catch and pass the exception (or suppress), or put the whole thing in an if statement that checks the version."
499,2017-08-10T10:51:54.761684,Ciera,I try the if statement but it's not working because it's a syntax error
499,2017-08-10T10:52:00.765984,Ciera,it can't even import the file :confused:
499,2017-08-10T10:52:01.766947,Meghan,"Oh, right, good point."
499,2017-08-10T10:52:16.777119,Meghan,if version: import module
499,2017-08-10T10:52:59.806045,Meghan,"Though, if the script is to work on the old version, are you subbing in a different module for the old version? Otherwise shouldn't you want it to fail the unit test?"
499,2017-08-10T10:53:38.832532,Ciera,the syntax error is only in the test
499,2017-08-10T10:53:52.841465,Ciera,in the module itself I made an if based on the version
499,2017-08-10T10:53:57.844805,Meghan,What is the syntax error?
499,2017-08-10T10:54:02.848331,Ciera,it's for an asynchronous context manager
499,2017-08-10T10:54:06.851148,Beula,You can check the `sys.version_info` and if it's before your thing do a no-op
499,2017-08-10T10:54:29.866900,Beula,"aiohttp does dynamic methods based on version, I added some of these :wink:"
499,2017-08-10T10:54:34.870038,Beula,finding a link
499,2017-08-10T10:54:58.886680,Ciera,yeah that's what I do but the syntax still need to be correct for the previous version
499,2017-08-10T10:54:58.886699,Beula,<https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/blob/master/aiohttp/client.py#L583>
499,2017-08-10T10:55:08.893282,Gabriele,Not possible to just fix the test?
499,2017-08-10T10:55:22.903213,Beula,"If you have to support old python, it isn't a broken test - technically"
499,2017-08-10T10:55:52.924710,Ciera,well if you can find me a way to write this with a python3.4 syntax I'm good for it
499,2017-08-10T10:56:04.932922,Ciera,"```
    def test_contextmanager(self):
        self.loop.run_until_complete(self.xmlrpc_with_context_manager())

    async def xmlrpc_with_context_manager(self):
        async with ServerProxy('<http://localhost/test_xmlrpc_ok>',
                               loop=self.loop) as client:
            response = await client.name.space.proxfyiedcall()
        self.assertEqual(response, 1)
        self.assertIs(self.loop, client._loop)
```"
499,2017-08-10T10:56:39.956866,Ciera,I think I might need to put it in a different file and play on that
499,2017-08-10T10:59:22.070233,Meghan,"In a class though? Oh, I can't imagine that not being ugly.

Perhaps inherit from the 3.4 safe class in the 3.5/6 class in the other file?"
499,2017-08-10T11:00:19.111244,Ciera,yeah that could work
499,2017-08-10T11:01:01.142288,Beula,Isn't the 3.4 syntax just `@asyncio.coroutine` on the function and `yield from` instead of `await`?
499,2017-08-10T11:01:10.148674,Beula,why do you need 3.4?
499,2017-08-10T11:02:00.184004,Ciera,yes it is but there is no syntax for `async with` (that I know of)
499,2017-08-10T11:02:19.197343,Ciera,I don't need it I'm on 3.6 but it was in the library so trying to not take it out
499,2017-08-10T11:02:28.203805,Meghan,I don't even bother with backwards compatibility to 3.5 :slightly_smiling_face:
499,2017-08-10T11:02:33.207186,Gabriele,"factor test into different file, conditional import?"
499,2017-08-10T11:02:35.208456,Beula,same 3.6+
499,2017-08-10T11:04:56.306170,Ciera,thanks guys

499,2017-08-10T11:05:42.337401,Beula,You're discriminating because I am the 1%!?
499,2017-08-10T11:06:04.353297,Patty,any tacos meant for <@Beula> can be sent my way
499,2017-08-10T11:06:38.376438,Meg,you just need to do a MIITM reroute for <@Beula> tacos
500,2017-08-10T11:23:34.049180,Patty,<@Meg> maybe i have one now :slightly_smiling_face:
501,2017-08-10T11:38:01.633158,Johana,that’s what happens when your taco king.
501,2017-08-10T11:38:06.636401,Johana,ppl stop giving you tacos
501,2017-08-10T11:52:49.212826,Junita,the problem with this whole taco thing is that it just makes me want tacos.  :confused:
501,2017-08-10T11:53:02.221122,Junita,and they aren’t exactly a thing in germany.
501,2017-08-10T11:54:04.262070,Beula,You could maybe start a trend there? Be the hipster of tacoism
501,2017-08-10T11:55:29.318559,Tandra,be the first currywurst taco entrepreneur :smile:
502,2017-08-10T12:17:09.135774,Junita,some bastard started a “mission-style” burrito shop here in town
502,2017-08-10T12:18:04.167586,Junita,and he says when in California he “saw” a lot of burrito shops and wanted to open one here
502,2017-08-10T12:18:22.178410,Junita,"and the decorations are quite authentic california, but apparently he saw a bunch but never ate at any because they are weird"
502,2017-08-10T12:19:53.232986,Beula,Maybe trying to adapt it for the common European pallet?
502,2017-08-10T12:20:29.254824,Junita,I mean I get doing things like making it less spicy so people here will eat it
502,2017-08-10T12:20:45.263959,Junita,but for example quesadillas - what are the only two damn things you need for a quesadilla?
502,2017-08-10T12:21:16.282552,Beula,"Meat, cheese and tortilla :troll: "
502,2017-08-10T12:21:28.289982,Junita,"the cheese, and a tortilla.  and I mean everybody loves simple stuff like that, but he put this weird stuff called kräuterquark in it instead"
502,2017-08-10T12:21:56.306125,Beula,Do you know any similarities to that?
502,2017-08-10T12:22:43.334368,Beula,All the Google results are in German!
502,2017-08-10T12:22:45.335590,Junita,it’s kind of hard to explain
502,2017-08-10T12:22:58.343506,Beula,Looks like a kind of dip or sauce?
502,2017-08-10T12:23:03.346075,Junita,I’d say closer to sour cream than cheese
502,2017-08-10T12:25:44.443338,Beula,Sounds a bit odd for quesadilla
502,2017-08-10T14:19:13.465016,Jesusa,i want the text one to be unique
502,2017-08-10T14:19:21.469395,Jesusa,(so pretty much act like an id)
502,2017-08-10T14:19:24.471471,Jesusa,but still have a numerical id as well
502,2017-08-10T14:20:19.503795,Jesusa,"empty db, insert ""a"", `(1, ""a"")`, then insert ""a"" should cause a conflict"
502,2017-08-10T14:23:56.631916,Antionette,what flavor of sql? you can probably add a unique index on it
502,2017-08-10T14:32:37.944651,Jesusa,"postgres, hoping it applies to sqlite too"
502,2017-08-10T14:33:22.970681,Beula,"```
create table table_name (
  id SERIAL,
  other TEXT UNIQUE
);
```"
502,2017-08-10T14:33:33.978559,Beula,sqlite doesn't have the SERIAL type though
502,2017-08-10T14:33:41.983446,Beula,"if you expect that to get huge, use `BIGSERIAL`"
502,2017-08-10T14:34:48.023826,Jesusa,"meh, I was indeed going with serial, didn't know it is not going to be supported in sqlite"
502,2017-08-10T14:34:56.028876,Jesusa,so thanks for pointing it out :slightly_smiling_face:
502,2017-08-10T14:35:15.039541,Patty,are you not using an ORM?
502,2017-08-10T14:35:44.056699,Antionette,<https://sqlite.org/autoinc.html>
502,2017-08-10T14:37:14.108852,Jesusa,<@Patty> In case I want to experiment in another language
502,2017-08-10T14:37:59.134655,Jesusa,I was thinking using clojure + datomic
502,2017-08-10T14:38:24.148995,Jesusa,lol I guess then i could still use ORM since sql doesnt work in datomic lol
502,2017-08-10T14:38:26.150290,Jesusa,mm
502,2017-08-10T14:42:58.306263,Jesusa,"It's not a good argument huh, to be able to switch a language"
502,2017-08-10T14:43:54.339132,Antionette,I think the main thing is whether or not you would use the migration features of the ORM
502,2017-08-10T14:44:07.346436,Antionette,but usually that's fairly separate anyway
502,2017-08-10T14:45:13.383494,Antionette,for instance you should have no problem using sql-alchemy or pony with an existing database
502,2017-08-10T14:45:27.391917,Antionette,even if you had been using that database with an existing codebase in a different language previously
502,2017-08-10T14:46:49.438842,Jesusa,hmmm
502,2017-08-10T14:46:56.443251,Jesusa,I have never done a migration and I always fear it
502,2017-08-10T14:47:13.452636,Jesusa,I always prefer to just delete the database
502,2017-08-10T14:47:15.454292,Jesusa,:confused:
502,2017-08-10T14:47:30.463305,Jesusa,it's a scary habit when something I make would hit production
502,2017-08-10T14:47:43.470978,Jesusa,I'd have no experience doing a migration
502,2017-08-10T14:48:00.480934,Beula,<@Jesusa> I have CI always run all migrations to make sure they are compatible
502,2017-08-10T14:48:36.501982,Jesusa,like just simply changing an existing column name or something
502,2017-08-10T14:49:38.538053,Beula,"You can use a number of technologies to do it, liquibase (java based), flyway (java based), alembic (python based), django ORM"

502,2017-08-10T14:51:13.593630,Jesusa,ansible and docker huh
502,2017-08-10T14:51:38.608239,Jesusa,it's a really nice example repo btw :slightly_smiling_face:
502,2017-08-10T14:53:47.681314,Beula,"Working on making it better overtime, the docker stuff isn't in prod yet :disappointed:"

504,2017-08-10T14:19:03.458733,Jesusa,"in sql, how to make it that we have a column with type id and a column of type text"
504,2017-08-10T14:27:49.769898,Antionette,for example in mysql if the table is already created you could use (<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-index.html>) and if you are making the table then with the unique constraint (<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table.html>)
504,2017-08-10T14:43:17.317611,Jesusa,because then you'd change your code to the ORM in that language
505,2017-08-10T16:40:35.176270,Tameika,what is the pythonic way to delete all files in a directory whose name contains a string belonging to a list?

505,2017-08-10T16:47:37.399837,Beula,What have you tried <@Tameika> ? You can get pretty close without deleting any files to prove out your idea!
505,2017-08-10T16:51:36.528900,Tameika,I actually added all the files to a csv and removed all of them and then copied all the entries in the csv to another folder
505,2017-08-10T16:52:09.546376,Tameika,"```def remove_blacklisted_lines():

	       			newfile.writr(line)```"
505,2017-08-10T16:52:50.568829,Tameika,<@Beula> : here the blacklisted lines actually correspond to the list of files I want to remove
505,2017-08-10T16:53:11.580145,Tameika,the file name is foo_bar_cat_XXXX_ dog
505,2017-08-10T16:53:31.591249,Tameika,and I want to check if `XXXX` is in my blacklist
505,2017-08-10T17:07:33.037814,Leonie,"if you want to find files matching a wildcard in Python, you could use the glob module. ```for path in glob.glob('foo_bar_cat_*_dog'):

506,2017-08-10T17:17:15.316362,Winnifred,"ooo <@Leonie>, I haven’t seen `glob` used before. That looks l337."
506,2017-08-10T17:17:35.324980,Leonie,there’s `iglob` too if you want an iterator
506,2017-08-10T17:18:14.342362,Leonie,and I think in 3.5+ you can even have it recurse directories for you
506,2017-08-10T17:18:40.354225,Winnifred,"nice, making mental note to use (i) `glob`!"
506,2017-08-10T18:10:14.644529,Maida,Hey guys
506,2017-08-10T18:19:55.843435,Tameika,"thanks <@Leonie>, and the snippet to solve my problem woud be :  ```import glob

507,2017-08-10T18:10:18.646090,Maida,I'm having a really bad time with forms
508,2017-08-10T18:45:58.346326,Jesusa,recursive is ** i believe
509,2017-08-10T20:45:01.086307,Johana,what forms?
509,2017-08-11T02:13:42.095826,Delphine,I’m sure someone does. Just ask your question.
510,2017-08-10T23:19:29.609938,Marilyn,Does anyone have any experience with scapy/reading packets manually?
511,2017-08-11T04:32:58.156456,Gertude,Is there something built in pycharm that builds requirements.txt for pip? Also how do I call pip install requirements from within my code? I am looking to package my code in a double click executable or at least run from terminal and it automatically installs all the modules and everything..
511,2017-08-11T04:33:54.174511,Gertude,Does windows have pip too? I never used microsoft windows so I don't know how my code would run there..
511,2017-08-11T04:34:15.181355,Carri,windows installations of python includes `pip` these days by default
511,2017-08-11T04:35:44.209325,Carri,You can use Inno Setup to create an exe installer for windows <http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php>
511,2017-08-11T04:36:34.225361,Gertude,Thank you <@Carri>
511,2017-08-11T04:37:11.237021,Gertude,What about pycharm and `pip` Requirements.txt?
511,2017-08-11T04:41:12.314710,Carri,<https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-requirement-files.html>
512,2017-08-11T05:35:28.386786,Meg,or use the command line `pip freeze &gt; /path/to/requirements.txt`
512,2017-08-11T05:47:27.620859,Collette,"Ideally `requirements.txt` should be populated manually, using top-level requirements such as `django`, `requests` and `djangorestframework`. After you have all of that in place, do `pip install -r requirements.txt` once. Then do `pip freeze &gt; requirements.lock.txt`"
512,2017-08-11T05:47:43.625710,Collette,Then always use `requirements.lock.txt` to install dependencies
512,2017-08-11T05:49:00.650243,Junita,"I do a `<http://requirements.in|requirements.in>` where I just list the requirements without versions, then `pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt <http://requirements.in|requirements.in>`"
512,2017-08-11T05:49:05.652092,Junita,and that maintains the exact versions.
512,2017-08-11T05:49:16.655465,Collette,"Or that, yes, using `pip-compile` flow"
512,2017-08-11T05:49:26.658730,Junita,i then use a service called PyUp I think it is to submit PRs when my stuff needs to be updated.
512,2017-08-11T05:49:37.662259,Junita,"It’s a pretty nice workflow, but yup, just one of a couple possibilities"
512,2017-08-11T05:49:56.668108,Collette,"But `requirements.txt` contains not only exact versions of dependencies, but exact versions of dependencies' dependencies"
512,2017-08-11T05:50:15.674262,Junita,oh right good point
512,2017-08-11T05:50:16.674772,Collette,That's the point of having two different requirements files
512,2017-08-11T05:50:49.685400,Collette,"In that case, the file with exact versions is often called a ""lock"" file"
512,2017-08-11T05:51:06.690998,Junita,a nice thing about the `pip-compile` (not sure if others offer this as well) is it adds comments about where the dependencies come from
512,2017-08-11T05:51:28.698059,Junita,"yeah I guess that’s a good point, it might be better to use that naming scheme"
512,2017-08-11T05:52:40.720942,Collette,"&gt; it might be better to use that naming scheme
Unless there's a tool that requires a specific naming, like `pbr` which expects `requirements.txt` file in the root of the repository"
512,2017-08-11T05:53:34.738452,Collette,"(I personally don't like it, I'd rather have a way to explicitly specify the path to requirements in the `setup.cfg`, but I've managed to overcome this by symlinking `requirements/runtime.txt` to `requirements.txt`)"
512,2017-08-11T05:54:51.762859,Junita,yeah I’ve never used that
512,2017-08-11T07:19:10.187436,Susanne,I need help sourcing ~/.zshrc
512,2017-08-11T07:25:30.289198,Carri,"weird, it's complaining about an `export` on line#87 but your rc file only goes to 86"
512,2017-08-11T07:25:50.294742,Suellen,&gt; source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
512,2017-08-11T07:26:17.302462,Suellen,shell probably concatenates them and calculated a line number after

512,2017-08-11T07:43:17.572546,Carri,did you paste the entire `.zshrc` file ? because it complaining about a line that doesn't exist is somewhat odd
512,2017-08-11T07:43:52.581697,Carri,"if you had an `export $SOME_VAR=` line, the problem would definitely be the `$` which isn't allowed in that context"

I thought it was supposed to represent binary but what does ‘\x00P’ mean? and ‘\xeeF’? I expected the value to all be hex based to represent binary data but theres a few chars that throw me through a loop? or is it that the ‘P’ is just what the hex value represents in ascii?"

Also if of 30,30 would translate too?"
520,2017-08-11T16:47:17.854870,Antionette,I think if the image is scaled using some actual scaling procedure then this wouldn't be valid but if you're just looking where the point would be proportionally on a different size image then you could use: `x1 / initial width = x2 / larger width` and `y1 / initial height = y2 / larger height`

I have the schema file <https://github.com/MichaelYusko/Geijutsu/blob/master/geijutsu/schema.py> and the basic idea, it’s validate a dict object.

For example

```
# Test class
from geijutsu import schema

class User(schema.BaseSchema):
    name = schema.Str(max_length=10)
    age = <http://schema.Int|schema.Int>(required=True)


user = User({'name': 'Mike', 'age': 10})
```
If everything is ok, need to return original object `{'name': 'Mike', 'age': 10}`

If data something like that `{'name': 'Mike', 'age': 'AGE'}`
need to return `{'age': 'Field must be integer'}`

I have some basic structure of project, but I need some advices, how I can improve code/structure and etc..

529,2017-08-14T12:56:01.821996,Ciera,javascript question should go in <#C45V5EJ15|javascript>. <#C07EFMZ1N|help> is more python oriented :slightly_smiling_face:
529,2017-08-14T12:56:08.826202,Chantell,<@Masako>   I am about to reinvest in python and came across connexion as a tool i could use in creating a security tooling api..
529,2017-08-14T12:56:15.830135,Ciera,If this is about python my bad
529,2017-08-14T12:56:23.834633,Chantell,I will be looking at it and if things turn out might be willing to help
529,2017-08-14T12:57:23.868328,Beverley,"it's a simple issue though, the rendered image has pixels offset seen on the image"
529,2017-08-14T13:07:34.219585,Beverley,"<@Meg> you'll see there's a grayscale image above the one in full color, it shouldn't have the lines and I believe it's because of the way I create and edit positions in javascript then render it in PIL that's bringing black boxes lines"
529,2017-08-14T13:09:47.291938,Ciera,I would use nested `with`
529,2017-08-14T13:10:07.303172,Ciera,maybe as ugly but more readable imo
529,2017-08-14T13:10:18.309243,Sade,i figured i must be missing some better option
529,2017-08-14T13:10:56.330034,Ciera,you can look at `contexlib.Exitstack`
529,2017-08-14T13:11:21.343667,Ciera,but if you only have two it might not be worth it
529,2017-08-14T13:11:44.356310,Ciera,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack>
529,2017-08-14T13:13:14.404760,Sade,that does look promising although it looks like i’ll have to depend on the python2 backport
529,2017-08-14T13:13:16.406102,Beula,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack>
529,2017-08-14T13:13:24.410281,Beula,"Oh, that's 3.3"
529,2017-08-14T13:13:53.425780,Ciera,<@Beula> :face_with_rolling_eyes:
529,2017-08-14T13:14:08.434072,Beula,"Oh, wow"
529,2017-08-14T13:14:17.439443,Beula,yep - my slack client didn't refresh yet
529,2017-08-14T13:14:19.440707,Beula,<@Ciera> :taco:
529,2017-08-14T13:14:29.446450,Sade,mmm that might work.  i’m not that accustomed to using the patch decorators so i didn’t think of it :slightly_smiling_face:
529,2017-08-14T13:14:48.456560,Ciera,haha yeah it happens sometimes :pacman:
529,2017-08-14T13:15:09.468820,Beula,"I use it for 2 levels or more, primarily because flat is generally better than nested"
529,2017-08-14T13:15:54.494544,Cherly,"One disadvantage of this usage, is that mocked method will be patched for all test function, but this leads to make them smaller ==&gt; smaller unit test"
529,2017-08-14T13:16:08.502359,Ciera,I agree but for only two levels it might make things a bit too complex
529,2017-08-14T13:16:35.517336,Sade,yeah that seems like an advantage :slightly_smiling_face:
529,2017-08-14T13:16:46.523883,Ciera,I like when you have multiple nested context managers with `if` for the one you want to enter
530,2017-08-14T13:05:37.155390,Meg,"not sure, what are you looking for?"
531,2017-08-14T13:08:52.261927,Sade,"hello there, style question:
```
    with patch(""core.http.requests.request"") as mocked_request, \
         patch(""core.http.time.sleep"") as mocked_sleep:
```
what’s the best way to avoid using a line continuation there?"
531,2017-08-14T13:09:33.284639,Sade,i can only think to use nested `with` statements which seems similarly ugly
531,2017-08-14T13:10:07.303055,Sade,"if those are the only two choices i would definitely go with the next `with`, anyway :slightly_smiling_face:"
531,2017-08-14T13:12:55.394934,Cherly,Why not set patch as decorator to test function?
531,2017-08-14T13:12:58.396380,Beula,I would use `contextlib.ExitStack`
532,2017-08-14T22:42:39.000084,Hermina,"Hi folks, It might a bit unrelated here. But i’m trying to use an api from other service. They give apikey, password, shared secret. apikey and password alone can help me get access to the api. So why we need an shared secret. I’m working with shopify api. Thanks!"
532,2017-08-14T22:43:53.000004,Beula,<@Hermina> - Usually when they give something like a shared secret it's either so your application can validate incoming requests (aka webhooks) or you can sign a payload before sending it to them (so they can validate similarly)
532,2017-08-14T22:50:28.000107,Hermina,thanks. Google got a bunch of crypto info but not helped :slightly_smiling_face:. It clearer for me now
533,2017-08-15T04:29:14.000114,Masako,"Thanks, <@Chantell> :slightly_smiling_face:"
534,2017-08-15T05:30:59.000101,Meredith,hi anyone here have experience with react native
534,2017-08-15T05:31:46.000061,Georgetta,"how can i hide ""OrderedDict"" when i print smth in console?"
534,2017-08-15T05:31:55.000259,Meredith,i can't get a way to handle csrftoken from the cookies
534,2017-08-15T06:37:22.000099,Suellen,"<@Georgetta> 
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = OrderedDict({'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3})

OrderedDict([('two', 2), ('one', 1), ('three', 3)])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(dict(data))
{'two': 2, 'one': 1, 'three': 3}
```"
535,2017-08-15T06:37:49.000018,Suellen,"not the best demonstration of order, but the idea is to convert it to a normal dict"
535,2017-08-15T06:38:07.000144,Suellen,"you lose the benefit of Ordering, but depending on why you need to print it - you might not need it"
535,2017-08-15T06:38:53.000026,Collette,Or use python 3.6+ :slightly_smiling_face:
536,2017-08-15T09:55:31.000131,Ok,"Hi All, am trying to trigger a python script using jenkins.. am not able to understand where am going wrong but the build is not getting successful or failure.. it was just keeping on blinking the blue ball saying build in progress.. i kept waiting hours but no response.. where the script am able to execute from command prompt.. having anyone faced kind of problem or any suggestions would be appreciated "
536,2017-08-15T09:57:57.000184,Collette,<@Ok> show us your script
536,2017-08-15T09:59:41.000148,Beula,And how you're calling it. Be sure to add logging to your script to know when/where it hangs (sounds like it's in a queue and never gets to an executor)
536,2017-08-15T10:00:23.000187,Ok,U mean python script <@Collette> 
536,2017-08-15T10:00:31.000263,Collette,Yep
536,2017-08-15T10:00:59.000433,Ok,I will try it <@Beula> but am able to execute other python scripts in jenkins
536,2017-08-15T10:01:09.000319,Collette,<@Beula> more like the python script is waiting for some input
536,2017-08-15T10:01:23.000330,Beula,Or that
536,2017-08-15T10:01:52.000161,Ok,Sorry <@Collette>  its too big script.. 
536,2017-08-15T10:02:06.000352,Ok,But its a unit testing kind off
536,2017-08-15T10:02:28.000352,Collette,"<@Ok> click on the plus sign to the left from the slack input field, and choose ""Add code or text snippet"""
536,2017-08-15T10:03:10.000491,Ok,<@Collette> its actually from my office server so i can take that script out
536,2017-08-15T10:03:32.000293,Collette,What?
536,2017-08-15T10:04:02.000258,Ok,Is cant take that script out to here
536,2017-08-15T10:04:21.000375,Beula,"In that case, you need to add logging to find where in the script the execution gets to - but beyond that I am not sure we can do much"
536,2017-08-15T10:05:20.000420,Ok,I will try as u said <@Beula> by logging to script
536,2017-08-15T10:05:56.000084,Beula,"It's a pretty common way to debug, it should often be one of your first actions when you hit an issue"
536,2017-08-15T10:07:27.000296,Ciera,first question is. does the scrip try to run ?
536,2017-08-15T10:07:37.000247,Ok,Yeah since am just new to this world of python and Jenkins thing learning <@Beula> 
536,2017-08-15T10:07:53.000451,Beula,Then add logging/print statements pretty judiciously :slightly_smiling_face:
536,2017-08-15T10:08:54.000421,Ok,"Script is trying to run, it not throwing any error but just running <@Ciera> "
536,2017-08-15T10:10:03.000203,Beula,"As <@Collette> mentioned, are you waiting for an `input` (or `raw_input` in py2) in the code? Any `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`? etc"
536,2017-08-15T10:10:28.000314,Collette,Or contains an infinite loop
536,2017-08-15T10:11:12.000118,Ok,No there is no input needed.. as i said its running fine in command prompt without error
536,2017-08-15T10:11:26.000603,Ok,Only when i integrate in Jenkins causing this error
536,2017-08-15T10:11:52.000140,Collette,<@Ok> do you have *any* output?
536,2017-08-15T10:12:09.000293,Ok,Yeah the out should be an html file
537,2017-08-15T10:31:37.000345,Meghan,"Speaking of logging. Is there a good best practice article on how to configure it? I'm getting double messages, but have been too busy dealing with functionality to try to figure out where I went wrong."
537,2017-08-15T10:36:47.000286,Beula,<@Meghan> You probably just have `propagate` set to true: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.propagate> That will have anything handled by a nested logger bubble up to the ancestors
537,2017-08-15T10:40:45.000628,Meghan,"Thanks, I'll take a look."
538,2017-08-15T11:16:15.000685,Juli,Hi Everyone Really need your <#C07EFMZ1N|help> I have deadline coming up for my project demo So can anyone provide with some knowledge on how to go on to build these interactive message buttons for a bot response in slack?
538,2017-08-15T11:16:35.000037,Juli,I am using Python for my development
538,2017-08-15T11:17:38.000056,Beula,"<@Juli> You usually get the best responses here when you have *specific* questions, where are you actually stuck?"
538,2017-08-15T11:21:52.000040,Juli,Yes so what I have till now is a bot in slack that uses Slackclient/RTM API/Flask for fetching a message in real time from a channel and only if it has certain keywords in the message then the bot responds with a ok message for now!
538,2017-08-15T11:23:04.000381,Juli,But what I want to do know is instead of replying with an ok message reply with these interactive message that does some particular action based on the button the user selects
538,2017-08-15T11:23:56.000429,Juli,But I am firstly not able to find a good documentation or a step by step guide for going with building this in python
538,2017-08-15T11:25:11.000113,Juli,So if anyone can provide me with a good tutorial or documenation or can point me to the right resource for building these in python then it would be a great help! Thanks !
538,2017-08-15T11:28:48.000242,Beula,Are you new to Python and http?
538,2017-08-15T11:33:07.000405,Juli,"Not new to python can write code with python and dealing with data, pandas, os, sys, functions, lists, etc! But not great with web and python so yes struggling with http and web related stuff!"
538,2017-08-15T11:34:50.000015,Beula,"I am just trying to gauge what kind of resources to send over, have you started with <https://api.slack.com/docs/message-attachments> ?"
538,2017-08-15T11:35:09.000414,Beula,calling <@Ciera> - is your sansio lib ready for prime time?
538,2017-08-15T11:38:15.000264,Ciera,no not yet :confused:
538,2017-08-15T11:44:10.000024,Juli,Yes <@Beula> I was reading through these yesterday but due to time constraints I was looking for something more narrower that gives an example of how to build one of these with python
538,2017-08-15T11:45:03.000245,Juli,There are examples of how to build one with node
538,2017-08-15T11:45:25.000035,Johana,doesn’t sirbot currently do this?
538,2017-08-15T11:45:50.000424,Beula,Yeah
538,2017-08-15T11:46:01.000361,Beula,But that's asyncio based - I wasn't sure if it would be a confusing resource
538,2017-08-15T11:46:18.000304,Juli,But I have not worked with node and was not finding a good documentation with python
538,2017-08-15T11:46:25.000023,Johana,<@Juli> go take a look at the sirbot source code.. it might be async but the process between your app and slack should be similar.
538,2017-08-15T11:46:42.000247,Beula,Let me find a direct link
538,2017-08-15T11:47:19.000132,Johana,yea that will probably be easier.
538,2017-08-15T11:47:27.000271,Beula,"hmm, well there is the giphy code... but not the router for the events"
538,2017-08-15T11:47:57.000223,Beula,<@Ciera> - can you point a good link for responding to message buttons from the sirbot repos?
538,2017-08-15T11:48:30.000339,Juli,Thanks will have a look! That would be very helpful
538,2017-08-15T11:49:43.000169,Johana,yea i haven’t had time to continue the bot tutorial but i’ve noted slack buttons :wink:.
538,2017-08-15T11:51:02.000406,Ciera,<https://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-slack/blob/master/sirbot/slack/dispatcher/action.py#L34>
538,2017-08-15T11:51:31.000424,Ciera,this is the coroutine that handle incoming `action`
538,2017-08-15T11:51:40.000601,Ciera,like press on a button
538,2017-08-15T11:52:03.000482,Ciera,it is then routed based on the `callback_id`
538,2017-08-15T11:53:10.000176,Ciera,for giphy it is routed to this:<https://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-pythondev/blob/master/pythondev/slack.py#L341>
538,2017-08-15T11:53:29.000321,Beula,<@Ciera> :taco:
538,2017-08-15T11:53:46.000078,Juli,<@Johana> that would be an awesome tutorial! Also I don't think there are many available already. Hopefully even I can contribute to it in a while
538,2017-08-15T11:54:00.000065,Ciera,you can then respond with a new message or update the original
538,2017-08-15T11:54:15.000094,Juli,Thanks <@Ciera> Will look into these
538,2017-08-15T11:56:50.000424,Juli,Thanks <@Beula> and <@Johana> as well! Really appreciate that!
538,2017-08-15T14:16:12.000215,Johana,yea i used that originally for the bot_tutorial but i had to hack it too much to get it to run in a jupyter notebook.
539,2017-08-15T13:57:28.000494,Meghan,"I'm late to this, but this library makes working with Slack easy: <https://github.com/lins05/slackbot> <@Juli>"
540,2017-08-15T14:17:19.000072,Johana,it expects a settings.py file in the root of the dir which is a little outdated nowadays.
540,2017-08-15T14:18:20.000369,Johana,if anything the config should look for it and offer another method or use env vars.
540,2017-08-15T14:18:24.000326,Meghan,"For the bot I wrote with it I did have to go around one of the recommended methods with the decorator and grab the data dictionary. But, otherwise worked fine."
540,2017-08-15T14:18:36.000068,Meghan,Environment variables are an option.
540,2017-08-15T14:18:50.000339,Meghan,"I agree with the settings.py though, that part should be fixed."
540,2017-08-15T14:19:06.000214,Beula,<https://github.com/lins05/slackbot/blob/develop/slackbot/settings.py#L39>
540,2017-08-15T14:19:31.000406,Johana,oh i guess it does have it.. opened my mouth again.
540,2017-08-15T14:19:34.000331,Johana,lol
540,2017-08-15T14:22:06.000435,Johana,still kinda not a fan of what was done there.
540,2017-08-15T14:23:24.000394,Meghan,"I wrote a bot with it that may be fun, after a discussion in here on Friday. A bot that executes python code from the chat if the tag is included. Of course, it will need a lot of safety checks before it runs the code."
540,2017-08-15T14:30:11.000196,Johana,"<@Meghan>, <@Beula> mentioned having some code that does that. it will setup a docker container and execute. perhaps something like that would work for you. i’m thinking the benefits are you can remove networking, volumes, etc."
540,2017-08-15T14:30:30.000403,Beula,"yeah, I should pull that code out of the other project"
540,2017-08-15T14:49:03.000415,Beula,"Can you define ""BBD""?"
540,2017-08-15T14:51:35.000535,Bronwyn,lol
540,2017-08-15T14:51:40.000186,Bronwyn,BDD
540,2017-08-15T14:53:22.000548,Bronwyn,had to quick scroll away from that link
540,2017-08-15T14:53:29.000043,Ciera,ah sorry
540,2017-08-15T14:53:30.000491,Winnifred,Lol
540,2017-08-15T14:54:26.000383,Bronwyn,"BDD, Python style for testing to be exact lol"
540,2017-08-15T14:54:33.000382,Ciera,but there is other definition than the nsfw one that are pretty funny :smile:
540,2017-08-15T14:54:44.000632,Ciera,"more seriously, I haven't"
540,2017-08-15T14:54:55.000013,Bronwyn,saw a bunch of libs but most dont look like they have much of a community
540,2017-08-15T15:01:42.000052,Beula,"BDD doesn't seem to be huge in python, the only place I have seen it really big is node and ruby"
540,2017-08-15T15:04:32.000035,Bronwyn,"bummer. Have been doing it in JS, feels different but idk if better yet."
540,2017-08-15T15:04:41.000102,Bronwyn,I weirdly feel like I want to write the tests
540,2017-08-15T15:05:11.000093,Beula,I guess that's a good outcome!
540,2017-08-15T15:05:33.000004,Bronwyn,"LoL, I’ll take it !"
540,2017-08-15T15:16:19.000400,Beula,It could be done kind of cool with context-managers probably
541,2017-08-15T14:47:47.000645,Bronwyn,"Anyone worked with BBD and python ? 
looking for recommendations"
541,2017-08-15T14:52:40.000345,Ciera,business driven development ? :troll:
541,2017-08-15T14:52:55.000383,Bronwyn,<@Ciera>  nswf bud
542,2017-08-15T16:40:46.000496,Wilda,Does anybody know where I can find documentation for `pkg_resources`? It doesn't seem to turn up anywhere except the setuptools documentation
542,2017-08-15T22:00:59.000095,Collette,<@Wilda> `pkg_resources` is a part of `setuptools`
543,2017-08-16T01:18:09.000113,Deedee,"Anyone know why from:
```
    x_spacing = [0,
                 int(x_axis_max*1.25*.2),
                 int(x_axis_max*1.25*.4),
                 int(x_axis_max*1.25*.6),
                 int(x_axis_max*1.25*.8),
                 ]
```
And to display:
`ax.set_xticks(x_spacing)`
`ax.xaxis.grid(color='#d0d0d0')`

It would display a line for all x_spacing values except the last one?"

544,2017-08-16T03:53:24.000165,Kiersten,<@Jeanette> I use django-debug-toolbar for debugging any django app

544,2017-08-16T04:01:19.000160,Collette,<@Florene> easy suggestion: run it in foreground
544,2017-08-16T04:02:05.000226,Collette,"Or use a remote debugger, for example <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/remote-pdb/>"

546,2017-08-16T04:46:10.000324,Gisela,"Hey guys. Newbie here! (just posted in the introduction channel!)
I'm building my first web app where the user logs in using his twitch account. I implemented python social auth for django (<https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django> ) and it works fine.

Now I want to add custom attributes to the SocialAuthUser model. I want to get the values for these attributes from the user's social account (twitch), so I'm gonna do a get request to twitch API using the access token I got on login/registration.
My question is, how do I extend the SocialAuthUser model and add the get request to twitch in the pipeline? 
more specifically:
1. How do I add custom fields to the SocialAuthUser model
2. In what .py file and in what class, method or function do I do the get request to get the data to populate the custom fields? 

Hope the question makes sense. :slightly_smiling_face: 
Thanks!"
546,2017-08-16T04:48:37.000419,Ciera,Hi <@Gisela> we have a dedicated <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channel. Question regarding <#C0LMFRMB5|django> should go there :slightly_smiling_face:

I just want to know if Apache Spark is good, and to combine to Django with Python? and what are the advantages and disadvantages? or do you have any other suggestion, I am willing to listen and understand. Thank you"
550,2017-08-16T11:25:30.000191,Meg,"For what? As usual, details about use cases are required for suggestions "
550,2017-08-16T11:26:33.000668,Assunta,"on how it work together, Imean the concept or architecture. because I don’t have yet experience in Python, and my team whole department is planning to move to python"
550,2017-08-16T11:28:35.000343,Assunta,for instance is that possible to use apache spark with django with python. and if that possible to rid the cron and just use rest api using python
550,2017-08-16T11:29:25.000154,Assunta,I am quite straggle on how I can align my team for this. and we have facing problem with PHP which is not valuable for big data analytics
550,2017-08-16T11:31:01.000300,Beula,I'm not sure the tech from the client to the database matters here - normally with spark wouldn't you stream off a read-replica and process the data?
550,2017-08-16T11:33:04.000703,Assunta,"<@Beula> I am not sure yet, because I don’t have experience yet using spark, I just quite in research and deep dive study by next week. but using spark with django is that make sense?"
550,2017-08-16T11:33:56.000080,Beula,"That's what I am saying, i don't think the ""with X"" is relevant"
550,2017-08-16T11:35:25.000117,Assunta,so meaning it cannot be mixed? is that what you are saying. but how can I use spark as web app interface? sorry not sure If I am correct on what I am saying but this is what I am thinking. correct me if I am wrong. thanks <@Beula>
550,2017-08-16T11:36:14.000162,Assunta,"because in Ruby, I can use Rails, then add the gem of apache spark to use"
550,2017-08-16T11:36:40.000220,Assunta,"but since we need a language that can process a big data analytics so we will choose python, which almost the same of ruby"
550,2017-08-16T11:37:49.000186,Beula,"I don't know spark well, but as far as I know you connect spark to a database and run the data transformations off there. What loads that database doesn't matter (PHP, Python, Raw SQL, etc)"
550,2017-08-16T11:45:10.000263,Assunta,I think you are correct. thanks <@Beula>

552,2017-08-16T20:38:55.000145,Prudence,I want to use an image in a post request (I'm using Bottle framework)

552,2017-08-16T20:47:57.000236,Meg,"if so, you can create a temp file, read the image into memory and pass it in"
552,2017-08-16T20:51:37.000072,Prudence,It takes the path of an image. Should I write the file to the disk and then pass that path to the FastGFile class?
552,2017-08-16T20:56:41.000160,Meg,I find it weird it can’t take in a temp file
552,2017-08-16T21:02:33.000033,Prudence,"I'm not sure of what FastGFile does. Perhaps it just reads a file as I would normally do with python, and adds extra features. I'll try to read it as normal, and pass that as the image data, skipping the FastGFile object"

I think if we have 4 core, we can create 4 processes with might better than 4 threads using one process right? I’m writing script to migrate data from db postgres to other db (elasticsearch)"
553,2017-08-16T23:22:58.000163,Johana,is what you have currently going super slow?

553,2017-08-16T23:24:04.000144,Beula,"In python we have the gil, which only lets a single thread run at a time. Given that, the only way threads help you in python is io bound things (waiting on network requests). Processes help for cpu bound work, but sharing data is expensive as it makes entire copies to share (since memory space isn't shared in python)."
553,2017-08-16T23:24:20.000074,Johana,i’ve never filled elastic search with tons of data but i have done so with postgres. typically in these situations you gotta be careful about your database sessions and want to use a connection pool.
553,2017-08-16T23:25:46.000060,Beula,"Agreed, I'm not sure how much perf you can really squeze out of a database migration (but since it should be 1 time, that's probably ok "
553,2017-08-16T23:26:35.000073,Johana,yea… i agree there sometimes its ok to ensure all the data goes in properly.
553,2017-08-16T23:27:49.000128,Johana,"i know i’ve done well over 10,000 transactions a second with postgresql. i’m not sure about elastic search."
553,2017-08-16T23:33:36.000118,Hermina,"umm, I do it quite simple by using django orm model. So technically I just assign my_models[0,100] to thread1, my_models[101,200]  to thread2…..
So each thread, I think it have it self connection pool. (every time I run 5 threads, I see 5 connection to db is open).
Sorry I still not clear what you are suggesting :disappointed:"
553,2017-08-16T23:35:53.000062,Hermina,"if I spawn 4 processes, will it use 4 core in cpu? Or I’m lacking of OS knowledge…"

```

Is there a function `f` that would allow for this?


I very often find myself repeating this pattern:


```
d = { ""some_preknown_key"": ""some_preknown_value"", }
if cond1:
    d[cond1_key] = cond1_value
    
if cond2:
    d[cond2_key] = cond2_value

    when(cond1, cond1_key, cond1_value),
    when(cond2, cond2_key, cond2_value),

which would return a regular dict, with the `cond1_key` and `cond2_key` keys only
present if the first argument of their respective `when` function call is `True`."
555,2017-08-17T05:16:01.000258,Lanita,"when could return the equivalent of `cond1_key : cond1_value`  if the first argument is True, else puts some key: value token of some kind that will be filtered out by cond_build_dict (which is a function that takes a dict and remove all keys containing this token)"

555,2017-08-17T05:21:38.000242,Gabriele,Personally I like the explicit `if` statements. If the dict really does have a variety of different permutations I like that to be explicit in the code
555,2017-08-17T05:22:22.000060,Lanita,"short, declarative code in one place is typically easier to read than slowly mutating an object to get to where we want to be"

&gt;&gt;&gt; d.update(**user_data() if store_user else {})
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.update(**group_data() if store_group else {})

This way the key isn't added to the dictionary if the condition is false"
555,2017-08-17T05:22:37.000189,Suellen,but I feel like it's already a bit ugly
555,2017-08-17T05:23:22.000190,Ciera,you could do a loop on your condition/value
555,2017-08-17T05:23:26.000010,Suellen,the upside is - you can cycle through multiple additional_dictionaries and conditions

555,2017-08-17T05:50:37.000060,Lanita,that's already getting ugly though
555,2017-08-17T05:50:39.000388,Ciera,"I think a better API would be 
```

555,2017-08-17T05:52:43.000061,Lanita,"so key is a `Tuple[Any, Any]`?"

555,2017-08-17T05:53:27.000171,Ciera,"or just an iterable of `[Any, Any]`"
555,2017-08-17T05:53:55.000033,Ciera,that way it's obvious what key you are trying to fill
555,2017-08-17T05:58:01.000227,Lanita,"ya. something like

```

555,2017-08-17T05:58:03.000232,Collette,What would be the resulting dict? I don't get it
555,2017-08-17T05:58:40.000014,Lanita,"malinoff, no extra dict options would leave the default dict, e.g `cond_build_dict(d) == d`"
555,2017-08-17T05:59:26.000169,Lanita,"<@Ciera> while that it shorter, it's less clear what's happening I think"
555,2017-08-17T06:00:29.000088,Collette,"Also, what's exactly wrong with ```
d = {'name': 'John'}

555,2017-08-17T06:10:09.000109,Ciera,I don't really agree with that but each is own
555,2017-08-17T06:10:41.000308,Ciera,if you name the function with an adequate name it should be obvious what it is doing and hide how it's doing it
555,2017-08-17T06:11:08.000055,Collette,<@Lanita> how so? What's the difference?
555,2017-08-17T06:12:28.000150,Suellen,Just gonna hide it...

555,2017-08-17T08:12:38.000168,Collette,"<@Lanita> `get_query_kwargs3` is still just one line shorter than `get_query_kwargs1`, what's the point?"
555,2017-08-17T08:12:50.000268,Lanita,it's not all about the number of lines
555,2017-08-17T08:13:52.000338,Lanita,it's about general readability (both of the entire thing and in diffs) and the ease of changing something
555,2017-08-17T08:20:57.000060,Collette,"I am not convinced. I think `get_query_kwargs1` is simple enough to write and to maintain, and `get_query_kwargs3` isn't much better to deserve a tested and battle-proven implementation of `cond_build_dict` and `only_if` functions."
555,2017-08-17T08:23:31.000190,Suellen,"I'd say even if solution#2 is 2x better than solution#1, it's better to take solution#1 and start using it or working on something else, than trying to achieve perfection"

d = {}
if collection_name:
         d[""collection_name""] = collection_name

is not the same as 
```
""collection_name"": only_if(collection_name, collection_name),
```
in 2nd case you will still create item in dict no matter what bool value of collection_name. And secondly `only_if` does pretty much look like `stm1 if cond else stm2`, don’t you think so?"

&gt; in 2nd case you will still create item in dict no matter what bool value of collection_name
No, the idea was `only_if` to return a sentinel object if the condition is false, so the corresponding key won't be created within `cond_build_dict`"
555,2017-08-17T08:28:49.000058,Liberty,"oh, yeah, see now, I got to conversation too late and did not notice `cond_build_dict`"

555,2017-08-17T08:32:11.000131,Lanita,"I'm trying it out with actual code, and I've figured that...
1. it's shorter, but not that much shorter. It does reduce duplication though
2. it makes it easier to group things by key ""theme"", but makes it harder to see what things will always be there and what things wont"
555,2017-08-17T08:32:41.000171,Liberty,"but only if there are lot of conditions  and they are made somewhere else programmatically, then it would make some pretty cool “magic”. But if you only got few of them and they hardcoded there then you should use 1 option, as it’s easier to understand and read."

555,2017-08-17T08:39:08.000407,Lanita,sql is a DSL. HTML is a dsl. json schema is a dsl. a Dockerfile is a DSL...

555,2017-08-17T08:39:43.000050,Collette,<@Lanita> that doesn't mean you have to create your own DSL.
555,2017-08-17T08:40:05.000222,Lanita,"There is a time and place for DSL's. My example is not, because the resulting code isn't much more reasonable than what I started off with"

555,2017-08-17T08:41:18.000486,Lanita,one might argue that any application is its own DSL

I am a newbie in Python. I know what I should do but the syntax is killing me.
I am working on a subscription task. We got 3 different memberships in our company. I have got the upgraded members already. I need to differentiate renewed and new members from each other now. In our db, there is a subscription table in which I can find a membership id and one or many subscription id for each member. Also, a start and end date for each subscription. So, what I need to write is: 

 For this member 
    if There is more than one start date and the other start date is before the first date of the chosen timeline 
    Then RENEWED
    Else NEW

If someone knows how to do it and help me in syntax, it will save my DAY!
Thanks"

557,2017-08-17T09:32:58.000186,Suellen,so that there's a base we can start with

558,2017-08-17T10:30:30.000101,Maida,"I asked in Django is there a way I can define a critical section for a whole block of code in Django? I have two services running at the same time and I don't want a ""start service"" thread running at the same time as a ""remove service"" thread.

558,2017-08-17T10:30:47.000098,Maida,is anybody here able to advise please?
558,2017-08-17T10:31:36.000541,Maida,I could probably do a hacky way and solve this with updates through the DB
559,2017-08-17T11:45:44.000421,Juli,hi everyone so I was going through this tutorial and <https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok> but did'nt quite get the Step 2: Refactor our script to work with Slack has ayone worked for something similar in python?
559,2017-08-17T11:47:59.000359,Beula,"<@Juli> are you stick on the slack oauth2 part, or what?"
559,2017-08-17T11:50:35.000458,Juli,yes <@Beula> I am stucked with the oauth and event subscription part
559,2017-08-17T12:15:13.000389,Juli,So my main goal is to create these interactive buttons right! So for that I have to create this slack app and in the request Url i use ngrok followed by a /slackmessage . Now I will have to do two things right. 1. Create an endpoint to handle post request to this request url and then respond to slack and 2. Within that Slack oauth and event subscripition also comes into play right?
559,2017-08-17T12:16:25.000327,Juli,Correct me if I am wrong anywhere. This is what I understood
559,2017-08-17T12:16:41.000617,Juli,and help in python for the same?
559,2017-08-17T12:17:06.000096,Ciera,"&gt; Within that Slack oauth and event subscripition also comes into play right

not necessarily. If you have only one team you can do that in the slack app interface"
559,2017-08-17T12:18:16.000246,Juli,"Then how is client id, client secret and verification token etc come into play here?"
559,2017-08-17T12:18:29.000393,Juli,It works without authentication?
559,2017-08-17T12:19:19.000584,Ciera,you can find them in your app page
559,2017-08-17T12:19:26.000156,Ciera,after you install it on your dev team
559,2017-08-17T12:20:07.000274,Juli,Because in this blog also the author said it did'nt work for her without authentication so i thought its necessary <https://tutorials.botsfloor.com/slack-app-or-bot-user-integration-842c3843eea8>
559,2017-08-17T12:22:11.000126,Juli,Yaa I got that but then do I not have to write a code to handle those parameters/tokens in the request/response to that Url?
559,2017-08-17T12:23:52.000387,Juli,Or is it done by itself?
559,2017-08-17T12:25:15.000655,Ciera,for action I don't think you need to perform any authentification on your side
559,2017-08-17T12:26:05.000061,Ciera,you can check with the verification token if the request is coming from slack but it's not mandatory
559,2017-08-17T12:27:39.000407,Juli,I think this is the part where I am stucked/not able to understand properly. Any python/flask example to handle request response to these request URL without Oauth?
559,2017-08-17T12:28:36.000346,Juli,I went to <@Alesia> but still not able to understand it from there
559,2017-08-17T12:31:29.000526,Chantell,where is the best book about design patterns and algorithms (in python?)
559,2017-08-17T12:32:19.000479,Ciera,you need to put an url in the interactive message setting and have a flask app listening on this url
559,2017-08-17T12:32:24.000075,Ciera,and you should be good
559,2017-08-17T12:32:35.000203,Gabriele,"<@Chantell>  To be honest, I don't find design patterns are as important in Python as they are in Java or C++. A lot of the big problems that the traditional design patterns solve don't really exist to the same degree with Python"

559,2017-08-17T12:35:05.000266,Chantell,okay.. I own an older edition of the python cookbook..  I was looking at it last night.. Maybe I just need to buy the new one.
559,2017-08-17T12:35:54.000105,Chantell,o gosh.. the older edition i have from 2013  is the newest one.  Okay

561,2017-08-17T13:56:04.000309,Maida,it should be /bark_resources/resource/[serial]/file
561,2017-08-17T13:56:38.000051,Maida,is django interfering with this perhaps
561,2017-08-17T13:57:32.000027,Maida,The uploads are going to the right place
561,2017-08-17T13:57:35.000663,Maida,but the reading isn't
561,2017-08-17T13:58:29.000074,Maida,but
561,2017-08-17T13:58:31.000015,Meg,you should build your path with MEDIA_ROOT
561,2017-08-17T13:58:33.000173,Maida,profile pictures work
561,2017-08-17T13:58:43.000725,Maida,"```MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'bark_resources/resources')
MEDIA_URL = '/resources/'```"
561,2017-08-17T13:58:56.000272,Maida,is what i have
561,2017-08-17T13:59:00.000470,Meg,yup
561,2017-08-17T13:59:10.000149,Meg,so construct the rest of the file path with that
561,2017-08-17T13:59:15.000445,Meg,"start it, actually"
561,2017-08-17T13:59:19.000368,Meg,and then append the serial
561,2017-08-17T13:59:27.000619,Meg,and filename
561,2017-08-17T13:59:33.000551,Maida,oh so manually
561,2017-08-17T13:59:40.000291,Maida,I've been calling um
561,2017-08-17T13:59:47.000689,Maida,the file from the file field
561,2017-08-17T13:59:51.000405,Maida,and converting it to a string
561,2017-08-17T14:00:34.000386,Meg,can you print out resource_file here?
561,2017-08-17T14:02:30.000498,Maida,according to the debugger
561,2017-08-17T14:02:36.000296,Maida,"resource_abspath = {str} '/home/mmacheerpuppy/bark/bark_drive/bark/bark_project/17082017IOVCAWKXYA/17082017IOVCAWKXYA.zip'
resource_file = {str} '17082017IOVCAWKXYA/17082017IOVCAWKXYA.zip'"
561,2017-08-17T14:02:41.000072,Maida,whether i can print the object
561,2017-08-17T14:02:44.000441,Maida,hang on
561,2017-08-17T14:03:10.000096,Mendy,Anyone have any experience working with text using cairocffi?
561,2017-08-17T14:06:25.000231,Meg,"oh, so abspath goes to the project root"
561,2017-08-17T14:06:46.000395,Meg,use `MEDIA_ROOT + / + resource_file`
561,2017-08-17T14:11:36.000234,Maida,Looks like it's going through with that
561,2017-08-17T14:11:39.000062,Maida,we'll see
561,2017-08-17T14:31:48.000030,Maida,Worked like a charm!
562,2017-08-17T16:15:13.000451,Gustavo,"Hi guys, looking for a bit of help of what best practice is.  We have multiple git repos of python packages.   There is some code that is shared between them that I want to pull of into its own project.  What is the most common way of managing dependencies between projects/repos?   This is not code that I can upload to pypy."
562,2017-08-17T16:15:56.000061,Meghan,You can still pip install it without using pypi.
562,2017-08-17T16:16:34.000311,Gustavo,so a virtual env for each project and then pip install the other projects for them?
562,2017-08-17T16:16:46.000370,Meghan,"If they are libraries, yeah."
562,2017-08-17T16:17:12.000465,Meghan,"You can even pip install it as development, so it won't be copied to site-packages."
562,2017-08-17T16:17:26.000415,Gustavo,right now they are just packages
562,2017-08-17T16:17:48.000302,Meghan,"Yeah, probably just pip install each library as a development."
562,2017-08-17T16:18:02.000118,Meghan,At least for people who are working on the code rather than just using it.
562,2017-08-17T16:19:15.000009,Meghan,"from pip install
```  -e, --editable &lt;path/url&gt;   Install a project in editable mode (i.e.
                              setuptools ""develop mode"") from a local project
                              path or a VCS url.
```"
562,2017-08-17T16:19:39.000022,Gustavo,ah ok I didn't know that existed
562,2017-08-17T16:20:49.000433,Meghan,"I've only used it once, but it is nice."
562,2017-08-17T16:31:40.000508,Gustavo,thanks
563,2017-08-17T21:58:22.000011,Jeanett,"hello
I am totally new to python, I just installed it now on my windows 8.1 system
when i went to my git bash and ran ""python -v"" it gave off a kind of a long list of gibberish rather than the version of python"
563,2017-08-17T22:01:20.000028,Marcie,"<@Jeanett> lowercase `-v` is ""verbose"", capital `-V` is version"
563,2017-08-17T22:02:37.000147,Jeanett,:grinning:
563,2017-08-17T22:02:51.000142,Jeanett,It worked. thanks mate
564,2017-08-17T23:34:37.000192,Margaretta,help with code
564,2017-08-17T23:35:07.000089,Margaretta,`code`
564,2017-08-17T23:36:16.000134,Margaretta,i get this error
564,2017-08-17T23:54:53.000051,Marcie,<@Margaretta> the `set` object in python doesn't support indexing because they're unordered collections of items
565,2017-08-17T23:56:36.000065,Marcie,as soon as you convert a list to a set you lose the ordering of any items inside
565,2017-08-17T23:57:13.000038,Marcie,you can optionally cast back to a list and then sort again
565,2017-08-17T23:57:50.000002,Marcie,`topdata = sorted(list(data))[0:3]`
565,2017-08-18T01:32:05.000110,Margaretta,<@Marcie> :taco:
565,2017-08-18T01:33:14.000086,Margaretta,<@Marcie>  - This works
565,2017-08-18T01:33:29.000137,Margaretta,`data=sorted(set([sanitize(t) for t in data]))`
565,2017-08-18T01:34:01.000047,Marcie,oh nice
565,2017-08-18T01:34:34.000071,Marcie,passing a set to sorted directly is definitely gonna come in handy for some code golf
566,2017-08-18T00:24:49.000049,Latrina,tl;dr I want to create multiple record of a Model based on a variable which sits pn the webpage(fron-end)
567,2017-08-18T02:00:29.000162,Latrina,"i would request you all , if you have a look to my problem. I need some advice with that ^^"
567,2017-08-18T02:01:23.000158,Marcie,<@Latrina> what's stopping you from just creating three instances?
567,2017-08-18T02:03:42.000139,Latrina,"its not only 3 , it depends , For example : If anyone wants to add 6 items, then they will add the items on the frontend variable(var item= 6) ,now  its 6 items"
567,2017-08-18T02:04:38.000012,Latrina,so the no of forms to be generated  depends on the value of a variable in Javascript
567,2017-08-18T02:06:38.000131,Latrina,<@Marcie>  do i have to use a for loop for this or is there any other way ?
567,2017-08-18T02:07:45.000145,Marcie,a for loop is fine if you need X instances of something to be created
567,2017-08-18T02:09:57.000028,Latrina,so in this case i have to pass the Js variable value(let's say n) to my function which will set the forloop to n.
567,2017-08-18T02:10:43.000043,Latrina,i was researching on this and found formsets(extras=some value)
567,2017-08-18T02:10:54.000221,Latrina,can i use form sets in my use case?
567,2017-08-18T04:48:14.000098,Latrina,Anyone ??
567,2017-08-18T07:32:21.000035,Marcie,"<@Latrina> sorry, i'm not too familiar with formsets, that's a good question for <#C0LMFRMB5|django> though"
568,2017-08-18T07:21:13.000023,Jeanette,Anyone stumbled upon something like this?
568,2017-08-18T07:41:07.000043,Rufus,"<@Jeanette> looks like either `parent_url_path` or `slug` are `None`, can you post more of your code that's causing this error?"
568,2017-08-18T07:48:16.000366,Rufus,"oh ok, sorry, I didn't realise the exception was coming from library code"
568,2017-08-18T07:49:17.000188,Rufus,"either the `wagtail_modeltranslation` package is broken, or it's expecting your model or some other part of your code to behave differently to how it actually is"
568,2017-08-18T07:51:34.000081,Rufus,"oh good heavens, they're dynamically attaching methods to classes"
568,2017-08-18T07:52:24.000088,Jeanette,yes and based on the language that is chosen you get the translated field
568,2017-08-18T07:53:53.000082,Rufus,"just makes it a lot harder to figure out what's going on without actually attaching a debugger to your code, that's all"
568,2017-08-18T07:54:15.000151,Rufus,"maybe file an issue with `wagtail_modeltranslation`? search around first to see if someone else already has, though"
568,2017-08-18T07:55:51.000203,Jeanette,yep that is true
568,2017-08-18T07:56:02.000160,Jeanette,It's been a couple of hours now ...
568,2017-08-18T08:00:33.000118,Jeanette,Why is it trying to reach the en version? I don't get it
568,2017-08-18T08:00:45.000197,Jeanette,tried: ['en/((?:[\\w\\-]+/)*)$']
568,2017-08-18T08:04:51.000130,Meg,"I think at this point, you need to attach a debugger and put a breakpoint on that line in wagtail_modeltranslation/patch_wagtailadmin.py"
568,2017-08-18T08:05:36.000227,Meg,"Because that's a wagtail issue, and if it's not reported, then the debugger can help"
568,2017-08-18T08:08:38.000034,Jeanette,thanks I didn't think about that
568,2017-08-18T08:21:54.000238,Jeanette,"just fyi the regex is matching the english version because of the i18n_patterns in settings.py urlpatterns += i18n_patterns(
    url(r'', include(wagtail_urls)),
)"
569,2017-08-18T09:52:04.000244,Lanita,"I have a package that I'm developing. I want to use the package inside of a virtualenv and install it with something like pip... but that's not possible unless I create a setup.py, right? Since pip only works with setup.py?
Setup:
```
mypackage/
    mymodule/
        __init__.py
testcode.py
requirements.txt
```
I can import the function defined in __init__.py to testcode.py by creating a virtualenv then symlinking the `mypackage` folder to my virtualenv"
569,2017-08-18T09:53:14.000310,Liberty,you can create setup.py and call it directly
569,2017-08-18T09:53:25.000604,Ciera,exactly. There is some tools that ease that. I heard some good things about Flit but never used it myself
569,2017-08-18T09:53:26.000418,Ciera,<http://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>
569,2017-08-18T09:53:55.000196,Lanita,I was just thinking that it's be nice to not have to manually symlink or write the setup.py (until it's needed later for packaging purposes)
569,2017-08-18T09:54:15.000562,Ciera,you can also install your package with the `-e` flags for pip
569,2017-08-18T09:54:27.000441,Ciera,that allow you to edit the code in place without needing to reinstall each time
569,2017-08-18T09:54:55.000070,Lanita,"yeah, but I still need a setup.py for that?"
569,2017-08-18T09:55:01.000340,Ciera,`pip install -e .`
569,2017-08-18T09:55:02.000108,Ciera,yes
569,2017-08-18T09:56:36.000123,Lanita,"Hm, I guess I'll just manually symlink to my venv's lib/python3.5/site-packages folder until I've written a setup.py file"
569,2017-08-18T09:57:12.000197,Lanita,Since it's symlinked I can edit the code in place just fine
569,2017-08-18T10:03:15.000372,Ciera,you might want to take a look at the tool I linked :point_up: it does almost everything for you for the setup.py
569,2017-08-18T10:08:55.000353,Lanita,"looking at it, it seems like a way to generate the setup.py and upload it to pypi. But I'm not sure how it helps if I'm not uploading it to pypi"
569,2017-08-18T10:10:25.000005,Ciera,well generate the setup.py :smile:
569,2017-08-18T10:10:36.000452,Lanita,"I suppose, but through another, new sytnax"
569,2017-08-18T10:10:38.000307,Lanita,syntax
569,2017-08-18T10:11:29.000417,Lanita,"by the way, I haven't heard much about alternatives to pypi... is there a way to create a custom repository like pypi, or do people usually just install from git repos? (Which pip support)"
569,2017-08-18T10:12:57.000652,Lanita,I suppose there's little reason to create a custom pypi repo when serving things from a git repo is simple enough
569,2017-08-18T10:19:13.000115,Ciera,usually from git or pypi
569,2017-08-18T10:19:52.000159,Ciera,there is also <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/devpi> if you want your own pypi
569,2017-08-18T10:20:47.000037,Ciera,and <https://pypi.org/> that is in the process of replacing PyPi
569,2017-08-18T10:23:01.000286,Lanita,"what's the difference between ""the"" pypi and <http://pypi.org|pypi.org>?"
569,2017-08-18T10:23:09.000448,Lanita,who thought that calling them the same thing was a good idea?
569,2017-08-18T10:25:29.000408,Lanita,"I see, it's a rewrite called warehouse but the main implementation instance will also be called PyPi."
569,2017-08-18T10:27:02.000404,Beula,"<http://pypi.python.org|pypi.python.org> is the legacy server, <http://pypi.org|pypi.org> is the new one"
569,2017-08-18T10:27:58.000402,Beula,"Naming it the same makes sense since it is the same thing, basically everything beyond the frontend and some plumbing, but the same spec"

570,2017-08-18T10:35:20.000443,Gabriele,What is the ORM? SQLAlchemy? Django? Something else? And how did you manage the migration?
570,2017-08-18T10:35:36.000151,Desire,ORM is Django.
570,2017-08-18T10:36:22.000380,Meg,Can you print out the django query 
570,2017-08-18T10:36:32.000230,Meg,And compare it to your straight sql

570,2017-08-18T11:25:52.000578,Meg,"Seems to be your django connection, I suspect "

571,2017-08-18T13:14:45.000118,Beula,AWS is fine :slightly_smiling_face:
571,2017-08-18T13:19:34.000149,Bruno,yea. i just like googles setup more. and also can be a lot cheaper.
571,2017-08-18T13:20:02.000136,Bruno,but im going to be setting up a project on aws too with ELB and docker using spot instances.
571,2017-08-18T13:20:32.000239,Bruno,mostly because we use it at work so i just want to make sure to have more chances to be familiar with it
571,2017-08-18T13:20:41.000022,Tandra,at what point do you actually need to use AWS or google rather than rolling your own?
571,2017-08-18T13:20:56.000274,Bruno,spot/preemptive instances can save a lot anyways.
571,2017-08-18T13:21:11.000570,Bruno,"to me, none"
571,2017-08-18T13:21:23.000115,Beula,I'd say when you need more of the components together than are available on their own
571,2017-08-18T13:21:26.000156,Bruno,i guess if you have highly specialized reasons
571,2017-08-18T13:21:45.000344,Beula,AWS you pay for ingress/egress (data in/out) - so if you are moving data around a lot AWS makes good sense
571,2017-08-18T13:22:01.000325,Bruno,like dropbox benefits from their hard drive tech they work with
571,2017-08-18T13:22:12.000235,Beula,(~AWS~ -&gt; _Preferred Cloud Provider_)
571,2017-08-18T13:22:34.000184,Bruno,"Azure is good, but its more expensive."
571,2017-08-18T13:22:57.000306,Bruno,and not as feature complete as google/aws
571,2017-08-18T13:22:58.000020,Suellen,"btw, are there any providers that provide ( :slightly_smiling_face: ) access to bare drives?"
571,2017-08-18T13:23:12.000350,Bruno,yea
571,2017-08-18T13:23:26.000361,Suellen,"I want to roll out ZFS, but none of providers known to me allow it"
571,2017-08-18T13:23:34.000243,Bruno,you can do that in AWS cant you?
571,2017-08-18T13:23:43.000306,Tandra,so is it more a case of ease of use or something?
571,2017-08-18T13:23:48.000208,Bruno,look for dedicated boxes.
571,2017-08-18T13:23:51.000287,Bruno,yea
571,2017-08-18T13:23:56.000555,Tandra,thought so
571,2017-08-18T13:24:06.000380,Bruno,why the need for zfs?
571,2017-08-18T13:24:19.000089,Suellen,"""very specialized reasons"" :slightly_smiling_face:"
571,2017-08-18T13:24:42.000197,Suellen,and their dedicated boxes don't use SAN or anything like that?
571,2017-08-18T13:24:48.000415,Suellen,just drives that I can access?
571,2017-08-18T13:24:57.000351,Bruno,on aws you can make pretty custom images.
571,2017-08-18T13:25:08.000119,Tandra,do they give you much control over it though?
571,2017-08-18T13:25:15.000068,Bruno,oh. idk about that much
571,2017-08-18T13:25:24.000040,Bruno,not sure honestly.
571,2017-08-18T13:25:40.000288,Bruno,<@Orpha> likes that one provider. cant think of their name.
571,2017-08-18T13:26:05.000260,Bruno,linode
571,2017-08-18T13:26:35.000140,Tandra,"i used to just use linode or other vps providers, recently started using digitalocean, they have a nice api for interacting with stuff"
571,2017-08-18T13:27:13.000035,Bruno,i like DO too. slightly more expensive than linode but UI is far better and they have a nice api
571,2017-08-18T13:27:14.000347,Tandra,just wondered if i was missing something obvious with the aws stuff
571,2017-08-18T13:27:34.000540,Bruno,you should be able to make custom images
571,2017-08-18T13:28:18.000432,Bruno,check the first result here.
571,2017-08-18T13:28:19.000177,Bruno,<https://www.google.com/search?q=aws+custom+image+with+zfs&amp;oq=aws+custom+image+with+zfs&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.11042j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8>
571,2017-08-18T13:28:21.000343,Tandra,using puppet and similar tools sorta makes a lot of it moot for me
571,2017-08-18T13:29:04.000019,Bruno,makes what moot? the system setup?
571,2017-08-18T13:29:22.000223,Bruno,i havent used puppet. i tinkered with ansible. but i mostly just use docker
571,2017-08-18T13:29:48.000560,Tandra,"not the system setup, i mostly use it for management"
571,2017-08-18T13:30:01.000344,Bruno,using alpine base images and host as either ubuntu or coreos depending on the needs
571,2017-08-18T13:30:06.000620,Bruno,ah
571,2017-08-18T13:30:24.000397,Bruno,managing infrastructure?
571,2017-08-18T13:30:41.000014,Tandra,very small infrastructure
571,2017-08-18T13:30:54.000500,Bruno,i learned about terraform for that and want to try and start using that
571,2017-08-18T13:32:16.000598,Beula,"Last company we just prebaked a base AMI and used that, no need for complex tooling"
571,2017-08-18T13:32:25.000055,Bruno,i think we use cloudformation at work. which is similar and built into aws
571,2017-08-18T13:32:50.000108,Bruno,yea. makes a lot of sense for most cases
571,2017-08-18T13:33:31.000084,Bruno,at work they want to use docker but dont know it very well. so hopefully going into a devops position i can play with that some
571,2017-08-18T13:33:59.000149,Tandra,im currently playing with docker :joy:
571,2017-08-18T13:34:07.000151,Beula,"We used docker on those, that was just the base system setup/config and docker was deployed onto it"
571,2017-08-18T13:34:13.000138,Tandra,it seems pretty neat
571,2017-08-18T13:34:23.000146,Beula,Should we take the convo to <#C22DMH61M|devops> ?
571,2017-08-18T13:34:45.000417,Bruno,Si
571,2017-08-18T13:44:44.000307,Orpha,<@Bruno> linode is currently updating their ui because they're tired of you complaining 
571,2017-08-18T13:44:57.000275,Bruno,sweet
571,2017-08-18T13:45:18.000429,Bruno,"lol. their UI is pretty bad. though, not as bad as godaddy"
571,2017-08-18T13:47:09.000282,Bruno,yea. i would also prefer cpanel over godaddy
572,2017-08-18T13:12:31.000378,Bruno,google to aws? Nooooo
573,2017-08-18T13:45:31.000256,Orpha,still better than using c-panel
573,2017-08-18T14:24:18.000367,Orpha,haha
574,2017-08-18T23:20:54.000043,Daryl,"Hi all, I am having an issue with sorting nested OrderedDicts..

I  am trying to sort both the outermost dictionary, and the following dictionary by a key value in the innermost dictionary.

Given the attached snippet, this what I am trying to accomplish:

- For all foods, order the food subtypes by highest calorie content (i.e - For Pizza, Pesto should appear first because it has higher calories when compared to cheese.
- Order all foods by highest calorie content (i.e - Pizza should appear first as it has a subtype with more calories than any other food)"
574,2017-08-18T23:29:37.000010,Daryl,"Before I tacked on the outermost dictionary, I was using this to sort just the food types (red,green,pesto,cheese):   `OrderedDict(sorted(d.iteritems(), key=lambda x: x[1].iteritems()))` .  However, I am not sure how to proceed after having tacked on the outermost dictionary."
574,2017-08-18T23:50:28.000063,Daryl,"Right, I'd like to make the structure into an OrderedDict. Can you point me in the right direction?"
575,2017-08-18T23:47:07.000047,Levi,The problem is then how to cast this as an OrderedDict?
575,2017-08-18T23:48:28.000047,Levi,"If that is the issue, then I can think of many non-pythonic approaches."
575,2017-08-18T23:56:55.000020,Levi,"why don't you try sorting the 2 groups separately, casting them into OrderedDict type as above. I ran your code and you are sorting operation is just making it alphabetical, ignoring the inner loops"
575,2017-08-18T23:57:16.000036,Levi,"sort Pizza, sort Apple, find Max of the two, append in order."
575,2017-08-19T00:13:30.000034,Levi,if you do the following `for item in d.iteritems(): print(type(item))` you will get `&lt;type 'tuple'&gt;`. You then have to unpack it accordingly making note of where your value pops out.
575,2017-08-19T00:13:43.000015,Levi,"now, if there is a less convoluted way to do this, I am all for it."
575,2017-08-19T00:16:15.000054,Levi,"the downside to this is that your sorting has to be via if/then type args inside each top level tuple. If there are more than two food subgroups, then you might call sort in the inner loop"
575,2017-08-19T00:20:27.000051,Daryl,I appreciate your help. I will see if I can play with the problem a bit more given your suggestions..
575,2017-08-19T00:20:49.000028,Levi,I also wonder at what level your reply ought to be

581,2017-08-19T13:16:18.000077,Prudence,Hello. I need help with tensorflow. I have a bottle server that sends an image to a tensorflow script which categorizes the image
581,2017-08-19T13:16:31.000007,Prudence,"After I send images around 5 or 10 times, it starts slowing down. The performance decreases a lot. The first time, the script runs in 1 second, and by the fifth or tenth time, it takes almost more than one minute."
581,2017-08-19T13:17:27.000080,Prudence,This is the code that I use to categorize the images using tensorflow
581,2017-08-19T13:18:12.000059,Prudence,And that is the code that I use to run the server
581,2017-08-19T13:19:14.000084,Prudence,"This is the line that slows down after many images: `predictions = sess.run(softmax_tensor, {'DecodeJpeg/contents:0': image_data})`"
581,2017-08-19T13:19:38.000042,Prudence,How can I improve performance?
581,2017-08-19T13:21:47.000114,Meg,"what are your server specs (ram, cpu)? How often are images sent to tensorflow?"
581,2017-08-19T13:25:43.000045,Prudence,"4GB Ram, 2 cores 1.8GHz. Right now, I'm sending the images myself through postman so it is not something specific, but I tried sending one image, wait until I get a result, I give it 5 extra seconds, and then send another image"
581,2017-08-19T13:27:47.000047,Prudence,"The first 5 times it gives a result in one or two seconds, then it starts slowing down"
581,2017-08-19T13:29:40.000077,Meg,I wonder if there’s a memory leak
581,2017-08-19T13:29:57.000060,Meg,"and more resources are being used, specifically ram"
581,2017-08-19T13:31:16.000066,Meg,"also, with your tf script, move the import outside the `recognize` function"
581,2017-08-19T13:31:24.000096,Meg,because its a wasted import each time
581,2017-08-19T13:31:55.000063,Prudence,Is there a python module to profile that?
581,2017-08-19T13:33:41.000011,Meg,its a code smell
581,2017-08-19T13:34:04.000015,Meg,only import modules in a function if you really need it locally and it costs alot to import
581,2017-08-19T13:34:48.000046,Prudence,I mean a module to profile the allocated memory
581,2017-08-19T13:34:58.000097,Meg,<https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/profile.html>
581,2017-08-19T13:37:28.000117,Prudence,I'll run it and hope to find the problem
581,2017-08-19T13:37:43.000038,Winnifred,do you know if tf.session is actually releasing your mem?
581,2017-08-19T13:38:06.000039,Meg,that’s a good question
581,2017-08-19T13:38:32.000037,Meg,"beautifulsoup has a bug, that with a context manager like that, it still doesn’t release memory if used in a loop 1000-1500 items long"
581,2017-08-19T13:39:04.000038,Prudence,"I assumed it does, since it's the recommended way according to tensorflow documentation. I'll try closing it manually"
581,2017-08-19T13:39:10.000023,Winnifred,i would check github and see if this is an issue
581,2017-08-19T14:10:48.000026,Meg,"eg, bottle/flask dev server"
582,2017-08-19T14:10:36.000025,Meg,"ok, so are you using a dev server for this or guicorn/wsgi?"
582,2017-08-19T14:11:10.000034,Prudence,I'm using bottle
582,2017-08-19T14:12:14.000034,Meg,yes
582,2017-08-19T14:12:36.000014,Meg,"but the dev server, eg command line start utility, or nginx/apache with gunicorn/wsgi?"
582,2017-08-19T14:16:09.000050,Meg,"becuase if this is on your local machine with zero prduction configuration, its either your machine or a memory leak"
582,2017-08-19T14:16:11.000015,Prudence,"Dev server I think, I'm running it from command line"
582,2017-08-19T14:16:18.000037,Meg,alright
582,2017-08-19T14:16:34.000062,Meg,what happens when you wait one minute in between
582,2017-08-19T14:17:03.000043,Meg,and run `top` to see what your system’s free memory looks like during that time
583,2017-08-19T14:59:54.000046,Prudence,"When I waited on minute after receiving a result, it was almost the same, it was eventually taking more time to get a result. Free memory sometimes decreased a lot when I sent data, and sometimes it decreased just a little, but eventually I had less free memory"
583,2017-08-19T15:01:59.000083,Prudence,"I tried not using anymore the context manager, and instead I used `sess = tf.Session()` and `sess.close()` to close it, but I had the same results"
583,2017-08-19T15:05:47.000061,Winnifred,what size are the images?
583,2017-08-19T15:06:16.000022,Prudence,18kb
583,2017-08-19T15:17:27.000014,Winnifred,have you tried this not using bottle?
583,2017-08-19T15:18:12.000027,Prudence,"No, do you think bottle could be the problem?"
583,2017-08-19T15:19:35.000001,Meg,"no, it shouldn’t"
583,2017-08-19T15:19:47.000006,Meg,but would be interesting if you can run this code standalone with an image
583,2017-08-19T15:19:58.000001,Meg,take the web server out of the equation and test with just tensorflow
583,2017-08-19T15:20:18.000021,Meg,would give clues to which direction you should go into
583,2017-08-19T15:20:25.000094,Winnifred,I don’t really know. I’m trying to isolate issue.
584,2017-08-19T15:41:16.000014,Prudence,"I tried two things, first I called the function to categorize in a loop, and got same result, by the 5th time it was slowing down. Then I tried to call in a loop my code to categorize as if from the command line, using `os.system(""python label_image.py image.jpg"")` and it worked, it always took around 2 seconds. So, does that mean that it is a memory problem? Or perhaps something when I import tensorflow"
584,2017-08-19T15:45:56.000031,Tandra,does travis-ci support any kind of test that requires a database?

588,2017-08-20T07:07:50.000016,Gisela,"Quick CSS question. 
Excuse the lingo, I'm a total css beginner.

I got a div:
```&lt;div class=""col-md-4""&gt;
        ... some content.
    &lt;/div&gt;```

It has the css  tag 
```.col-md-4 {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    min-height: 1px;
    padding-right: 15px;
    padding-left: 15px;
}```
I want to add padding-top: 15px   without modifying the ""original"" or global .col-md-4 css. 
How do I add to that class (?) a top padding on just one instance on my index page?"

588,2017-08-20T07:09:59.000025,Ciera,for your question the idea would be to create a second class just for `padding-top` and add this to the element classes
588,2017-08-20T07:10:05.000007,Ciera,but I'm no css expert
588,2017-08-20T07:10:22.000006,Ciera,on my keyboard it's `alt-gr + 7`

589,2017-08-20T11:54:19.000009,Collette,<@Cristy> `get_type_hints` is just a proxy for `__annotations__` with a bit of additional reverences

590,2017-08-20T18:55:49.000072,Tandra,nice catch and thanks
591,2017-08-20T18:54:56.000025,Mariano,On the `__init__` you are handling the exception by just printing it. That will cause that when there is a connection problem your script will just print the error and continue. I think that's not what you want
591,2017-08-20T18:55:16.000008,Mariano,Don't catch exceptions for just printing
591,2017-08-20T18:55:35.000008,Mariano,unless you are doing something with value with it. Dont do it. Let your program crash
591,2017-08-20T18:56:06.000042,Mariano,for example in your case: you could catch the exception to try to retry the request
591,2017-08-20T18:56:16.000025,Mariano,although i think `requests` can do that for you
591,2017-08-20T18:56:16.000049,Tandra,thats a great idea tbh
591,2017-08-20T18:57:09.000009,Tandra,"and yeah thats exactly the behaviour i would like, thank you <@Mariano>"

591,2017-08-20T19:02:25.000093,Mariano,"You are doing the same con `create_dir`. How things are right now. If the user doesn't have the permission. It will print the error and continue. Which will cause that `save_dump` will try to create a file on a dir that can't be created. Unless you have a workaround the permission problem, let it crash on `create_dir`"
591,2017-08-20T19:03:11.000052,Mariano,"That's all. Everything else looks good to me. Although the class might not be needed, but that is a design choice"

601,2017-08-21T12:48:30.000326,Gabrielle,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.timedelta(days=90)
datetime.timedelta(90)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
```"
601,2017-08-21T12:48:44.000153,Gabrielle,^ this would not the way I assume
601,2017-08-21T12:50:52.000377,Gabriele,"yes, that is the way"
601,2017-08-21T12:52:20.000038,Gabrielle,"<@Gabriele> 
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; timedelta_today = datetime.datetime.today() - datetime.timedelta(days=90)
&gt;&gt;&gt; timedelta_today == datetime.timedelta(days=90)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt;
```"
601,2017-08-21T12:52:30.000003,Carri,"date object - timedelta object =&gt; new date. or date - date =&gt; timedelta, and check the n on that (if you go the second route, timedelta_object.days will give you the day diff"
601,2017-08-21T13:04:15.000058,Gabrielle,"<@Carri> 
I think I figured it 

```
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_date = datetime.datetime.strptime('2017-07-03T20:35:45.000Z', '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')
&gt;&gt;&gt; some_date
datetime.datetime(2017, 7, 3, 20, 35, 45)
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.datetime.today() - some_date
datetime.timedelta(49, 7033, 562942)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (datetime.datetime.today() - some_date).days
49
```"
602,2017-08-21T13:05:31.000133,Deedee,"<@Meg> Got it working. :smile:
Was the exact same graph (with data) as when I had last ran it. Turned out that although I was editing a new file, it was still running the previous file. Error alerted me after I erased the earlier file. Also, did not make it a class. Maybe it should be, but I'll wait until a future version."
602,2017-08-21T13:13:03.000030,Meg,"ah, makes sense."
602,2017-08-21T13:13:12.000168,Meg,glad it was a simple issue!
603,2017-08-21T16:42:38.000284,Bruno,"what ways would you guys automate adding new users at a company, to remote servers? the most open way i can think of is just a simple bash script for setting up a users local environment, to also add their user/key to a remote server."
604,2017-08-21T16:43:15.000293,Ciera,ansible ?
604,2017-08-21T16:44:53.000158,Bruno,yea. we use salt stack at work so i was looking into that too.
604,2017-08-21T16:46:21.000424,Beula,"I like making them set it up following a guide, myself. Then they actually know what's up"
604,2017-08-21T16:46:23.000604,Bruno,i already have a bash script made to do the process. part of the process of me moving to ops at work. i think for normal stuff though a bash script is probably going to be my best bet.
604,2017-08-21T16:46:41.000192,Beula,Then have them enter their stuff in a web-form or whatever for the remote server
604,2017-08-21T16:46:45.000407,Bruno,yea. they want to make it all automated.
604,2017-08-21T16:47:00.000161,Bruno,i just ask questions with bash `read` on the cli
604,2017-08-21T16:47:18.000028,Beula,They are shooting themselves in the foot if the people who know how things really work leave - but aight
604,2017-08-21T16:48:29.000249,Bruno,"well to be fair, most of the devs dont need to ssh into remote servers. we do use vagrant for local dev. we do have a guide for getting into those and debugging"
604,2017-08-21T16:49:23.000214,Bruno,we can already deploy testing setups based on the current app that are short lived anyways (default 24hrs). mostly just for testing
604,2017-08-21T16:49:39.000020,Bruno,and we dont allow people into normal staging/prod
604,2017-08-21T16:50:47.000424,Johana,what about LDAP?
604,2017-08-21T16:51:03.000175,Bruno,we dont have an ldap server
604,2017-08-21T16:51:11.000317,Johana,that’s what i mean. set one up.
604,2017-08-21T16:51:18.000261,Bruno,would be another way too though.
604,2017-08-21T16:51:42.000020,Johana,that’s probably more long term.
604,2017-08-21T16:54:00.000376,Johana,i’ve had to use a number of approaches at different jobs. the most simple i can think of atm is ansible but saltstack can do the same.
604,2017-08-21T16:54:08.000254,Bruno,ive never set one up? are they hard?
604,2017-08-21T16:54:29.000304,Johana,i’ve only setup windows AD before.
604,2017-08-21T16:54:34.000197,Bruno,ah
604,2017-08-21T16:54:46.000013,Johana,i should set one up. they can be useful for businesses and all sorts of applications.
604,2017-08-21T16:54:56.000064,Bruno,im not sure we would need that though. since devs are limited to what they can ssh into remotely anwyas
604,2017-08-21T16:57:35.000419,Johana,if you are already using saltstack just use that.
604,2017-08-21T16:58:16.000144,Bruno,yea. that was my thought. i was just trying to think if there was any other methods i should consider or make an example for.
604,2017-08-21T16:59:28.000508,Johana,"yea, onboarding is always one of those “stop and see how to do this better” things."
604,2017-08-21T16:59:44.000338,Bruno,im wondering if i should even make an example for that. since i dont think its something we will be using anyways.
604,2017-08-21T17:00:31.000001,Bruno,our onboarding setup is already pretty good. vagrant and opendns to provide accecss to staging servers.
605,2017-08-21T21:13:12.000105,Alba,Whenever I run `pytest say_hello.py` it says `no tests ran in 0.00 seconds`

605,2017-08-21T21:18:01.000237,Alba,So the file has to start with `test_` and be in a directory?
605,2017-08-21T21:18:47.000086,Beula,Your assert is just run on first import of the file
605,2017-08-21T21:18:52.000016,Beula,So yes
605,2017-08-21T21:21:58.000007,Alba,it still can't find it :disappointed:
605,2017-08-21T21:24:31.000240,Beula,<@Alba> please show your directory structure and how you run the command 
605,2017-08-21T21:25:22.000144,Beula,Maybe this quick post will help with the command <https://pyslackers.com/blog/testing-a-python-library-with-pytest/>
605,2017-08-21T21:27:30.000013,Alba,"Practice/
  -__init__.py
  -test_say_hello.py

inside Practice i'm running `pytest`, outside Practice I run `pytest Practice`"
605,2017-08-21T21:34:23.000114,Beula,"Did you look at the post? You shouldn't have the test files in the same dir, and be sure to `import Practice`, then run `python -m pytest` from the parent dir "
605,2017-08-21T21:40:36.000181,Alba,"Thanks you, I ended up separating the files.
Practice / 
  -__init__.py
  -say_hello.py
  -test_hello.py

then inside `test_hello.py` i did `from say_hello import say_hello`"
606,2017-08-21T23:15:23.000159,Ocie,anybody on?
606,2017-08-21T23:16:33.000018,Marcie,"<@Ocie> numbers come and go throughout the day, just ask your question and people will generally respond when they can"
606,2017-08-21T23:16:44.000058,Collette,<@Ocie> lots of people. Just ask your question
606,2017-08-21T23:17:36.000120,Ocie,i want to set up a validator that is UniqueTogether and contains a FK
606,2017-08-21T23:17:47.000050,Ocie,have you guys done that?
606,2017-08-21T23:19:54.000038,Ocie,"i want to validate NetworkRouteSerializer  considering origin, destiny and the LogisticsNetwork FK"
606,2017-08-21T23:30:12.000017,Beula,<@Ocie> generally it's best to ask in the targeted channel if it's not general Python questions.

607,2017-08-21T23:53:53.000019,Bruno,yea theres also <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science>
607,2017-08-21T23:54:00.000127,Bruno,so i would try there first
607,2017-08-21T23:54:13.000057,Star,Oh. Thank you. Would join there.
608,2017-08-22T05:04:22.000414,Kelli,"Hi, everyone. I am very new in python world. 
What's the difference between `python -m pip install pymongo` and `pip install pymongo` ?"
608,2017-08-22T05:06:13.000189,Misty,I think they are the same thing. `pip` just calls `python -m pip`
608,2017-08-22T05:06:45.000425,Misty,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25749621/whats-the-difference-between-pip-install-and-python-m-pip-install>
608,2017-08-22T05:07:17.000311,Collette,"That's not strictly true, but ~often~ in most cases they're interchangeable"
608,2017-08-22T05:08:22.000196,Collette,You should use `python&lt;version&gt; -m pip` when in doubt which python will be used to invoke `pip` executable
608,2017-08-22T05:09:08.000041,Rufus,"Depending on how you installed Python and Pip, you'll usually have a `pipX.Y` binary in your `$PATH` too"
608,2017-08-22T05:09:19.000196,Ciera,and use a virtualenv for your project to not cluter the system python
608,2017-08-22T05:16:00.000238,Kelli,"thanks a lot guys, I am reading it. And yes, I am using virtualenv in my project. :stuck_out_tongue:"
609,2017-08-22T09:38:06.000223,Meg,this would belong in <#C0LMFRMB5|django>
609,2017-08-22T09:38:35.000412,Adrian,"Whoops, sorry! Gonna delete and repost there"
610,2017-08-22T09:58:50.000693,Wynona,"Hi guys I am new around here, have a question what do you recommend continue with Python from beginner to intermediate level, or experience my next programming language on my list (Java or Javascript)?"
610,2017-08-22T09:59:08.000031,Gabriele,depends what your end goal is.
610,2017-08-22T10:20:06.000342,Wynona,"becoming a developer, still dont know what area or direction?"
610,2017-08-22T10:20:43.000261,Gabriele,I'd advise looking into that aspect. Because it will help you decide
610,2017-08-22T10:23:49.000772,Wynona,I want to go for data science or ML vs web applications
610,2017-08-22T10:25:12.000796,Meg,"so, ML and data science is heavily python now"
610,2017-08-22T10:25:22.000157,Meg,some java in those fields
610,2017-08-22T10:25:42.000446,Meg,"but, languages are just tools"
610,2017-08-22T10:26:06.000305,Thomasina,"Haha, language is such a tool!"
610,2017-08-22T10:26:08.000316,Meg,"pick which one has the best applications to your task at hand, and balance with community participation and library support"
610,2017-08-22T10:26:24.000138,Gabriele,If you like data science and ML then maybe stick with Python and look at playing with `scikit-learn` for a bit
610,2017-08-22T10:28:40.000541,Wynona,"I already started 2 data science courses, but is so hard to focus on them, cause there are so many other sources for this, duno still try to focus on something and finish it, I think is a kind of trap these days with so many free access to knowledge still I happy for this though"
610,2017-08-22T10:28:54.000674,Meg,yeah
610,2017-08-22T10:28:56.000552,Gabriele,"yeah, pick one, finish it, then do another one"
610,2017-08-22T10:29:04.000649,Meg,one of the difficulties is figuring what to focus on
610,2017-08-22T10:29:14.000562,Meg,and sometimes its like reading a topic at wikipedia
610,2017-08-22T10:29:24.000138,Meg,"you're on one particular article, with a link to something esle"
610,2017-08-22T10:29:38.000460,Wynona,"believe me I am all over the place right now, accessing a lot of info"
610,2017-08-22T10:29:56.000366,Meg,and then somehow you find yourself reading about a coast guard rescue in the 50s :=D
610,2017-08-22T10:30:08.000259,Meg,wikipedia rabbit hole
610,2017-08-22T10:30:55.000617,Wynona,"I was the other day on quora, started with python ended in what killed the dinosaurs"
610,2017-08-22T10:30:58.000030,Wynona,:slightly_smiling_face:
610,2017-08-22T10:31:49.000750,Meg,:smile:
610,2017-08-22T10:41:31.000306,Meg,"I don't go there much, since I don't get much out of those videos without good captions"
610,2017-08-22T10:42:14.000060,Wynona,guys anyone of you did some kind or pair programming or found a mentor that helped you?
610,2017-08-22T10:42:26.000318,Meg,not really
610,2017-08-22T10:42:49.000321,Meg,there were a couple seniors that I leaned on when i was a junior
610,2017-08-22T10:43:03.000745,Meg,"but code reviews and quality feedback are essential, I feel"
610,2017-08-22T10:43:28.000081,Meg,"as long as the critiques are fair and balanced, and you don't take them personally"
610,2017-08-22T10:45:38.000289,Wynona,still trying to decide to go for a conversion program from business (my major) to ICT vs bootcamp vs continuing self study
610,2017-08-22T10:46:29.000606,Wynona,of course I want to get into programming to get a job and enjoy
610,2017-08-22T10:47:16.000064,Gabriele,"I was self-taught for several years, then went to university. I think the idea of an individual mentor is a bit of a luxury, but getting feedback via forums, Slack, Stack Overflow etc, is a good alternative"
610,2017-08-22T10:47:29.000042,Meg,"also, groups like this are invaluable"
610,2017-08-22T10:47:39.000621,Meg,"as long as you find a good one, and learn how to properly ask a question"
610,2017-08-22T10:48:35.000179,Wynona,":slightly_smiling_face: I discovered slack and ICT groups 2 days ago, pretty new around here"
610,2017-08-22T10:50:50.000147,Thomasina,Sorry? You mean YouTube videos without captions? (Not sure if you were talking to me) <@Meg>
610,2017-08-22T10:51:39.000634,Meg,"<@Thomasina>, not you specifically"
610,2017-08-22T10:51:51.000243,Meg,more like relating my experience with youtube as quicksand :smile:
610,2017-08-22T10:52:41.000257,Thomasina,"Oh, I see. However might I ask what you mean by ""captions""? Just curious."
610,2017-08-22T10:52:53.000278,Meg,"closed captioning, subtitles"
610,2017-08-22T10:53:00.000070,Meg,I'm deaf and wear hearing aids
610,2017-08-22T10:53:28.000686,Meg,"so, while I can hear just about everything in my hearing range (have pretty significant high frequency loss), there's a large gulf between _hearing_ and _understanding_"
610,2017-08-22T10:53:38.000440,Meg,"so, I use lip reading alot to understand speech"
610,2017-08-22T10:53:39.000031,Thomasina,"Oh, wow! I had no idea! Well, that makes perfect sense then."
610,2017-08-22T10:54:00.000242,Thomasina,Are the YouTube auto-captions still :poop: ?
610,2017-08-22T10:54:28.000152,Meg,"so, for me... if we were talking face to face in English, I wouldn't have any trouble conversing with you.  but if you were to rotate so your back was to me, you'd go from speaking English to Russian.. and I don't speak Russian"
610,2017-08-22T10:54:53.000639,Meg,lip reading helps me to put values to a series of sounds of speech to understand
610,2017-08-22T10:55:16.000051,Meg,"and autocaptions have come a long way, and the ones for conference presentations are very good"
610,2017-08-22T10:55:31.000216,Ciera,yes
610,2017-08-22T10:55:42.000118,Meg,"but there's a big difference in that quality and what you see in movies, TV and live programs"
610,2017-08-22T10:55:59.000254,Meg,"and that's mainly due to quality of the audio, as well as placement of the microphone"
610,2017-08-22T10:56:33.000079,Meg,"with speech, the closer the microphone, the better."
610,2017-08-22T11:01:42.000167,Thomasina,"Oh, yes. Actually I have a lot of interest in developing accessibility-related products (primarily for their function and not so much for profit). It's good to hear that - at least for some videos - auto-captioning has gone from laughable to actually helpful. There are so many ways that technology can be used to aid those with various circumstances and conditions, and even those I _think_ it has improved somewhat, I feel like the entire field could use a lot more attention and work."
610,2017-08-22T11:02:30.000580,Meg,there actually is alot of work going on now
610,2017-08-22T11:02:56.000425,Meg,"in fact, microsoft research has shown that their auto transcription error rate is lower than that of professional transcriptionists"
610,2017-08-22T11:03:14.000002,Meg,<https://qz.com/812317/microsoft-msft-claims-its-speech-transcription-ai-is-now-better-than-human-professionals/>
610,2017-08-22T11:03:35.000306,Meg,"but again, the primary differentator is quality of the audio combined with background noise"
610,2017-08-22T11:13:24.000533,Thomasina,"Niiice! Well, glad to hear there are some significant advances being made then. While (as far as I know) my hearing is alright, even I would appreciate automatic, perfect transcriptions. Actually I often use subtitles with educational material even if the speaking in the video is good, as I find it helps me to fully comprehend what's being said."
610,2017-08-22T11:18:30.000332,Johana,i like subtitles for the comprehension too. i feel like i understand better.
610,2017-08-22T11:18:50.000430,Meg,same here.. I acutually did a project in undergrad using dragon naturally speaking in transcribing college lectures
610,2017-08-22T11:19:12.000678,Meg,"turned out, it worked best for online video classes, specifically my calc 2 class"
610,2017-08-22T11:19:22.000637,Johana,also when you have a baby and don’t want that baby to wake up you get used to it.
610,2017-08-22T11:19:28.000104,Johana,lol
610,2017-08-22T11:19:29.000351,Meg,ha yeah
610,2017-08-22T11:19:50.000014,Meg,"I can imagine, wou;dn't know from personal experience :smile:"
610,2017-08-22T11:19:54.000126,Johana,that’s when i noticed w/ subtitles i picked up more on the conversation or little giveaways.
610,2017-08-22T11:21:12.000500,Johana,dragon is really nice.
610,2017-08-22T11:21:25.000409,Johana,my wife was an aspiring writer for a couple years and she used that.
610,2017-08-22T11:21:40.000551,Johana,"again, b/c of baby. lol"
611,2017-08-22T10:39:59.000446,Thomasina,What about YouTube? It's like quicksand
611,2017-08-22T10:40:16.000387,Ciera,it's rought and get everywhere ?
612,2017-08-22T13:39:50.000023,Bernita,"Hey, I'm trying to scrape ""<http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=pit&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=y&amp;type=8&amp;season=2017&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2016&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0>"" and put it in a MySQL database using beautiful soup.   Not only am I having trouble finding the correct table in the html, i can't figure out how to identify it in my soup code.  The documentation has been less than helpful."
612,2017-08-22T13:42:15.000302,Bernita,"I've never used a web scraper before, and I'm pretty lost"
612,2017-08-22T13:42:23.000586,Deedee,<@Bernita>  What does your current code look like?
612,2017-08-22T13:44:11.000239,Meg,"yeah, you're going to have some issues with that"
612,2017-08-22T13:44:20.000309,Meg,take a look at the networks tab in your browser tools
612,2017-08-22T13:45:09.000482,Meg,for example
612,2017-08-22T13:45:09.000699,Meg,<http://www.fangraphs.com/extfghtml.aspx?fgtype=30>
612,2017-08-22T13:45:27.000608,Meg,all that information is populated dynamically
612,2017-08-22T13:47:01.000484,Meg,"so, what you'd need is a headless browser"
612,2017-08-22T13:47:14.000080,Meg,"load the web page in the headless browser, wait for it to finish"
612,2017-08-22T13:47:30.000397,Bernita,I'm trying to set it up so that I can run it every morning and refill my db then run my rankings algorithm
612,2017-08-22T13:47:33.000420,Meg,"then extract the html from the browser, toss it in BS and extract what you need"
612,2017-08-22T13:48:10.000280,Bernita,sorry...headless browser?
612,2017-08-22T13:48:29.000058,Meg,run the browser without a gui
612,2017-08-22T13:48:35.000409,Meg,so you load the web page as it would normally
612,2017-08-22T13:48:52.000046,Meg,"so, waht happens with that site you want to scrape is that the data is all loaded asynchronously"
612,2017-08-22T13:49:02.000539,Meg,"so, requests and beautifulsoup won't do"
612,2017-08-22T13:49:23.000395,Meg,"you need to have a browser instance running to load the content, render it as you'd expect"
612,2017-08-22T13:49:53.000097,Bernita,ouch...can u send me a link that describes what im trying to do?
612,2017-08-22T13:50:45.000344,Meg,"well, you can google it yourself and find a number of resources."
612,2017-08-22T13:50:57.000493,Meg,but the gist of it is like googlebot crawling websites for indexing
612,2017-08-22T13:51:09.000344,Meg,<https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome>
612,2017-08-22T13:51:13.000097,Bernita,ok cool...thanks
612,2017-08-22T13:51:41.000054,Bernita,back to the drawing board lol
612,2017-08-22T13:51:55.000287,Meg,or check if that site has an api you can use
612,2017-08-22T13:52:10.000208,Meg,"FYI, there's <#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping> channel here"
612,2017-08-22T13:54:20.000244,Bernita,you're a g...appreciate it
612,2017-08-22T13:55:55.000448,Meg,"iinteresting, the TOS on that site doesn't say anything about not using the data"
612,2017-08-22T13:56:06.000134,Meg,"just this 

&gt;ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL."
612,2017-08-22T13:56:41.000090,Meg,"usually with sites like those, there are stricter usage conditions"
612,2017-08-22T14:06:37.000371,Ramona,"I was once in a similar situation, I used Selenium to open a webpage, dumbed its content into a file and parsed what I needed. If you use webdriver you don't even need to use a headless browser."
612,2017-08-22T14:08:06.000376,Meg,"actually, you do"
612,2017-08-22T14:08:16.000589,Meg,because selenium needs something to actually render the page
612,2017-08-22T14:08:29.000203,Meg,"typically, chromedriver, phantomdriver, etc"
612,2017-08-22T14:08:42.000301,Ramona,"You're right about that, when I said you don't need a headless browser, I meant you can just use your regular browser"
612,2017-08-22T14:08:48.000383,Meg,"ah, ok :slightly_smiling_face:"
612,2017-08-22T14:08:56.000621,Meg,"yup, true"
612,2017-08-22T14:09:16.000163,Meg,"but that's also more time-consuming, and not quite what I think <@Bernita> wants in this case"
612,2017-08-22T14:10:40.000259,Ramona,"I never used the headless chrome, but it looks like it's already capable of creating a simple dump without any other tools! That's actually pretty cool"
612,2017-08-22T14:11:37.000407,Meg,"yep.  Originally, you had to go through quite a few steps to do it, and so phantom was usually the option of choice"
612,2017-08-22T14:12:04.000526,Meg,"but now that google's made headless chrome much easier to use in testing, usage rates are going up"
612,2017-08-22T14:12:30.000062,Meg,which makes sense
612,2017-08-22T14:12:30.000554,Meg,<http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/>
612,2017-08-22T14:12:36.000344,Meg,take alook at the server/runtime part
612,2017-08-22T14:12:50.000598,Meg,"PJS is PhantomJS, and its pretty incompatible with ES6"
612,2017-08-22T14:12:57.000368,Ramona,"Since when does it exist? I remember looking for a headless browser last year, but couldn't find anything useful except for phantomjs"
612,2017-08-22T14:13:24.000407,Meg,"but given that there was only one dev/maintainer, even getting to the feature level it did is a great accomplishment"
612,2017-08-22T14:13:32.000084,Meg,<https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome>
612,2017-08-22T14:13:57.000323,Meg,"its available on linux and osx as of chrome 59, windows as of chrome 60"
612,2017-08-22T14:14:16.000061,Ramona,"Pretty cool, have to remember that"
613,2017-08-22T14:56:45.000422,Star,Yes. And I'm not sure why they haven't improved it yet.
614,2017-08-22T15:47:59.000228,Sharika,is there a way to package my current version of python3 and also all the packages i downloaded in my virtualenv into 1 file so then I SCP my whole project to another machine?
614,2017-08-22T15:49:13.000259,Johana,you can do a recursive scp and move the folder with all the contents
614,2017-08-22T15:49:26.000102,Beula,"<@Sharika> assuming the same architecture and system deps, you could probably just tarball up the project dir... but that's a bit odd - may be best to use Docker, install them fresh, or maybe pyinstaller"
614,2017-08-22T15:49:31.000148,Johana,o wait n/m you want the virtualenv too.
615,2017-08-22T16:23:39.000130,Maida,Hey
615,2017-08-22T16:23:48.000299,Maida,are there any jinja template language masters
615,2017-08-22T16:25:06.000371,Maida,"I have passed a key into the template {{course.id}} I need some way of accessing that key in dict {{course_completion_percentages}}. I wanted to try ```{{ course_completion_percentages.{{course.id}}  }}```, but that's invalid. {{course_completion_percentages.2}} gives me the value I want (by explicitly passing the information)."
615,2017-08-22T16:25:12.000444,Maida,Not sure how to best deal with this
615,2017-08-22T16:26:14.000376,Ciera,`course_completion_percentages[course.id]` ?
615,2017-08-22T16:27:50.000652,Maida,Unfortunately it cant parse that
615,2017-08-22T16:28:16.000138,Maida,```{{ course_completion_percentages[course.id]  }} ``` nor ```{{ course_completion_percentages.[course.id]  }}```
615,2017-08-22T16:28:34.000058,Suellen,what type is `course_completion_percentages`?
615,2017-08-22T16:28:43.000057,Maida,dict
615,2017-08-22T16:28:49.000574,Ciera,do you get an error ?
615,2017-08-22T16:28:55.000099,Maida,yep
615,2017-08-22T16:29:09.000278,Maida,```Could not parse the remainder: '[course.id]' from 'course_completion_percentages[course.id]'```
615,2017-08-22T16:29:27.000596,Beula,Online claims `dict.get(val.id)` may work
615,2017-08-22T16:29:29.000024,Maida,I can do the explicit declaration {{course_completion_percentages.2}} but that's not what I want
615,2017-08-22T16:29:36.000389,Maida,oh lordy
615,2017-08-22T16:30:09.000277,Beula,Are you sure you're on jinja2? The `foo[bar]` should work from everything I see
615,2017-08-22T16:30:25.000267,Maida,I did it
615,2017-08-22T16:30:28.000144,Maida,```{{ course_completion_percentages.get }}{{course.id}}```
615,2017-08-22T16:30:30.000400,Maida,lmao
615,2017-08-22T16:30:33.000064,Beula,weird
615,2017-08-22T16:30:50.000200,Maida,im on the most recent django
615,2017-08-22T16:30:54.000267,Maida,so im with whatever bundled with that
615,2017-08-22T16:31:02.000171,Beula,that's the django templating language
615,2017-08-22T16:31:10.000227,Maida,ohh
615,2017-08-22T16:31:12.000212,Beula,"it looks like jinja2, but slightly less powerful"
615,2017-08-22T16:31:25.000599,Maida,well i think we should sticky this find then
615,2017-08-22T16:31:26.000424,Maida,:stuck_out_tongue:
615,2017-08-22T16:31:38.000310,Maida,this is gonna be some atlantis tier information
615,2017-08-22T16:31:56.000146,Beula,A number of people recommend a custom tag <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8000022/django-template-how-to-look-up-a-dictionary-value-with-a-variable>
615,2017-08-22T16:32:26.000295,Meghan,"This is new to me, pycharm created a virtual environment but then it lacked pip and setuptools."
615,2017-08-22T16:32:39.000271,Meghan,"Creating another one, so this isn't a question, yet."
615,2017-08-22T16:32:58.000237,Ciera,which python version ?
615,2017-08-22T16:33:03.000658,Meghan,3.6.0
615,2017-08-22T16:33:16.000021,Ciera,hmm weird
615,2017-08-22T16:33:19.000402,Maida,yeah ive had that happen
615,2017-08-22T16:33:25.000652,Maida,you need to
615,2017-08-22T16:33:28.000253,Maida,manually install pip
615,2017-08-22T16:33:31.000410,Maida,um
615,2017-08-22T16:33:57.000456,Meghan,Is there a windows equivalent to which to see which pip I'm running?
615,2017-08-22T16:34:15.000393,Meghan,All of the other environments work fine.
615,2017-08-22T16:34:21.000073,Maida,ive never got
615,2017-08-22T16:34:22.000336,Maida,virtual env
615,2017-08-22T16:34:24.000235,Maida,on windows to work
615,2017-08-22T16:34:29.000547,Maida,otherwise i'd be using it
615,2017-08-22T16:34:43.000040,Meg,ouch ok
615,2017-08-22T16:34:50.000250,Meghan,I have over a dozen and haven't ran into this issue. When 3.6 first came out I had to do it manually because pip was too out of date though.
615,2017-08-22T16:34:51.000283,Meg,"well, that there is half your problem, I suspect"
615,2017-08-22T16:34:52.000170,Meg,window
615,2017-08-22T16:35:11.000049,Meghan,"lol, yeah, they won't give us Linux and this machine is too weak to run a vm decently."
615,2017-08-22T16:35:23.000244,Meg,:facepalm:
615,2017-08-22T16:35:30.000354,Meghan,"Eh, I need to upgrade to 3.6.2 anyway."
615,2017-08-22T16:35:34.000250,Meg,where do you work?  so I don't apply there by accident :smile:
615,2017-08-22T16:35:51.000565,Meghan,A fortune 150 telco.
615,2017-08-22T16:36:00.000122,Beula,can you install linux yourself? I did that...
615,2017-08-22T16:36:25.000028,Meghan,"lol, I don't think they approve that one. They don't even let us have admin rights. Though, I do have work-arounds for that."
615,2017-08-22T16:36:38.000223,Beula,:disappointed:
615,2017-08-22T16:37:06.000366,Meg,"uhm, yeah"
615,2017-08-22T16:37:13.000072,Meg,that there would have me looking
615,2017-08-22T16:37:22.000258,Meghan,"They have ViewFinity which elevates certain whitelisted programs to admin to install or run. For some reason they made the python 3.6 binary one of those programs. So, subprocess.call(['cmd']), boom, you are admin."
615,2017-08-22T16:37:34.000477,Meg,"working under those conditions, with the wide range of programming positions available, why stay?"
615,2017-08-22T16:37:44.000011,Meg,aside from job security?
615,2017-08-22T16:37:52.000022,Meghan,I'm halfway a network engineer and halfway a programmer these days.
615,2017-08-22T16:38:18.000403,Meghan,"And, I am applying elsewhere. If I could find a work from home that pays just a tad better I would probably go. But, otherwise, the environment is laid back."
615,2017-08-22T16:38:36.000278,Meg,gotcha
615,2017-08-22T16:38:49.000194,Meg,"so, you like the job, just pain in the ass conditions?  been there a few times :slightly_smiling_face:"
615,2017-08-22T16:38:56.000467,Meghan,Yup.
615,2017-08-22T16:39:04.000645,Meghan,Big corporate stuff.
615,2017-08-22T16:40:04.000574,Ciera,try the windows subsystem :smile:
615,2017-08-22T16:40:05.000247,Meghan,"The Windows Python installer is still stupid. Such weird defaults, and it offers to not install tk. :open_mouth:"
615,2017-08-22T16:40:22.000336,Meg,windows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
615,2017-08-22T16:40:23.000383,Meghan,"Not on Win 10, though some volunteered for that."
615,2017-08-22T16:40:49.000170,Meghan,"I do have a few linux servers I could work in, but no x."
615,2017-08-22T16:41:07.000325,Meg,"alright, I'm outta here.  workday's done... finally"
615,2017-08-22T16:41:11.000410,Ciera,does windows remote desktop can connect to a linux box ?
615,2017-08-22T16:41:12.000478,Meg,see you all tomorow :slightly_smiling_face:
615,2017-08-22T16:41:15.000110,Meghan,Enjoy the evening.
615,2017-08-22T16:41:17.000333,Ciera,:wave:
615,2017-08-22T16:41:42.000549,Meghan,"If the linux device had rdp setup I suppose it could. But, the servers I have access to don't have X on them."
615,2017-08-22T16:42:20.000169,Maida,oh wait my solution isn't working x.x
615,2017-08-22T16:42:26.000127,Meghan,It would be nice to get the lead engineer to convince IT to get him a better VM with X and we could both just remote into it for development.
615,2017-08-22T16:42:27.000373,Maida,bleurgh this is disgusting
615,2017-08-22T16:51:38.000249,Meghan,"Hmm, so I look now and pip and setuptools are in the environment even though they weren't before. I think I just need a new laptop."
615,2017-08-22T17:00:17.000446,Maida,i created a template_tags.py and put the tag suggested in but it's not recognised x.x
615,2017-08-22T17:11:30.000565,Meghan,<@Maida> What templating system are you workign with?
616,2017-08-22T16:39:17.000065,Meg,"hey, <@Hung> thought you had to be over 18 to create an account?  :thinking_face:"

618,2017-08-23T09:37:27.000663,Meg,what's the script?
618,2017-08-23T09:37:37.000598,Meg,I've had similar things happen when using beautiful soup in a loop
618,2017-08-23T09:37:59.000496,Ciera,there is some profiler available. Some should have memory support
618,2017-08-23T09:38:15.000440,Meg,even explicit garbage collection call ever 100 iterations didn't work
618,2017-08-23T09:38:21.000352,Suellen,`memory_profiler`
618,2017-08-23T09:42:11.000100,Abigail,"In one, I am creating a batch script  that has a bcp statement and then executing that script.  It is a large archiving process so I am going it in loop to grab date information to plug into the bcp command. I can share the script when. I get to my office. "
618,2017-08-23T09:43:09.000455,Abigail,"But again, it doesn't seem to matter the script. My sys admin is convinced it is the code, and to some degree it is, but the memory is still held even when I kill the python script"
618,2017-08-23T09:44:50.000653,Abigail,I'll look at memory_profiler when I get to the office too
618,2017-08-23T09:45:04.000525,Gabriele,"held by what? If the script process is dead, it wouldn't show up in any diagnostic, so how do you know it's being held?"
618,2017-08-23T09:47:29.000127,Abigail,"I can see, in resource manager, that the memory grabbed while the script was running never releases back for use. Ii know what you are saying cause that was my thought. That is why I am hoping to trace the trail to see if I can figure why a service holds to the memory after grabbed in the script"
618,2017-08-23T09:49:00.000450,Meg,"so you're saying that even after you kill the process, the memory is never released?"
618,2017-08-23T09:51:41.000261,Abigail,"Correct, but I can see it being consumed as a script runs (almost all of my scripts have something to do with lots of data). "
618,2017-08-23T09:52:23.000414,Ciera,are you accessing a database or something ? you sure every connection are cleanly closed ?
618,2017-08-23T09:55:47.000455,Abigail,"I am accessing a database, I make explicit closes to the connection, before the script ends, on any script where I am using psycopg2 or pyodbc. And on a BCP command  I'm executing a batch script which is a self contained process"

618,2017-08-23T09:58:23.000077,Gabriele,"sometimes it's possible to do something which triggers a memory leak elsewhere. For example, I once saw a computer with network drivers that had a memory leak. So if I downloaded a big file, 10 minutes later the computer was unusable"
618,2017-08-23T09:58:41.000305,Abigail,The batch script is created with python but it runs BCP
618,2017-08-23T09:59:52.000409,Abigail,"<@Gabriele> interesting, my pet theory has been the network drivers haven't been releasing data, similar to what you are saying. How were you able to trace it?"
618,2017-08-23T10:00:44.000338,Meg,is there any similar issue reported with the server drivers?

We saw that the computer was slow when we had a downloader program running, but a bit of experimentation showed that it didn't get fixed when we closed the program, so we figured it might be related to network activity. From there, I think we started to look specifically at the memory usage of the driver DLL, then searched to see if there was a common problem with it (and there was)"

631,2017-08-24T05:20:37.000284,Lanita,"Any recommendations on how to write understandable documentation for
e.g. dicts of dicts?

Let's say we have a function that returns a dict like this:

```
    {
        ""XUC-231"": {
            ""Volvo"": ""A nice Volvo"",
        }
        ""ABD-417"": {
            ""Ford"": ""It doesn't work!"",
        }
    }
```

Using Python's typing module (which we could put as a function
annotation), we could write this as:

```
    def f(...) -&gt; Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]:
```
    
or to make things clearer:

```
    RegistrationNumber = CarBrand = Description = str
    def f(...) -&gt; Dict[RegistrationNumber, Dict[CarBrand, Description]]:
```

Or perhaps something more... GraphQL-y perhaps? Something like

```
{
    reg_number: str {
        car_brand: str = description: str
    }
}
```

This would also give us a recommended variable name for each variable,
which is worthwhile if we want other functions calling this functions
to interact with the dict using the same name."

634,2017-08-24T08:55:32.000092,Gustavo,"Design question for you guys.  Not sure what is considered the correct way to do this in python

I have 2 types of output files (s3 and fs).  I have created a class for each.

I have a script which actually creates the data and then writes it to the output files (obviously the s3 and fs classes are abstracing out the differences between the two).

I have been debating if it is better to pass the class of the output file in, or pass a generator function in which can create the output format.  At first was leaning towards the class, but the more I think about it, the more I am leaning towards a generator function.  

Multiple output files are created by the script which is why I can't just pass an actual instance of the object."
634,2017-08-24T08:58:14.000206,Collette,That sounds like a case for a function
634,2017-08-24T08:58:28.000245,Collette,"`write_to_s3` and `write_to_fs`, specifically"
634,2017-08-24T09:00:49.000354,Gustavo,"well the function wouldn't actually do the writing, just generate the ""file"" to write to"
634,2017-08-24T09:01:21.000330,Gustavo,I basically just wrapped up the s3 to act like a file object so I could write and read to it like a normal file
634,2017-08-24T09:02:26.000577,Collette,ah
634,2017-08-24T09:02:28.000478,Gustavo,this way the script doesn't care where it is writing
634,2017-08-24T09:03:23.000187,Collette,Then you just need to accept a file-like object to write into.
634,2017-08-24T09:03:55.000398,Gustavo,right kinda.  since the script is generating multiple files I can't just pass in the object
634,2017-08-24T09:04:10.000434,Collette,You'll need an object per file
634,2017-08-24T09:04:31.000069,Gustavo,"I was initially thinking to just pass in the class, but started to lean more towards passing in a funciton that returns the object"
634,2017-08-24T09:04:33.000236,Collette,Just like you need a regular file object per file
634,2017-08-24T09:04:39.000362,Gustavo,correct
634,2017-08-24T09:05:38.000584,Gustavo,would it be better to pass in an open_s3_file function or just pass in the s3_file class that responds to open (just like a normal file)
634,2017-08-24T09:05:52.000205,Gustavo,"both will work, just wondering what is considered more pythonic"
634,2017-08-24T09:06:14.000158,Collette,It would be better to pass a `S3File` instance that acts like a file-like object.
634,2017-08-24T09:06:51.000288,Gustavo,I can't pass the instance since I don't have it yet.   The script will need to create a bunch of them
634,2017-08-24T09:08:27.000415,Gustavo,"the script/function is basically reading a bunch of tables from a database, doing some transformations and then writing them out to files"
634,2017-08-24T09:08:36.000312,Gustavo,the destination could be an s3 or standard filesystem
634,2017-08-24T09:09:15.000353,Gustavo,"the way it is currently written it only writes to the standard filesystem, I am trying to abstract out the destination so that it can write to s3 as well"

634,2017-08-24T09:27:57.000203,Collette,<@Gustavo> I don't think you're trying to understand what I'm trying to say. Can you look from another point of view?

636,2017-08-24T10:08:26.000782,Blanche,"There are 10,000 reports for this year alone. I made a massive spreadsheet to break all of this down, but it's soooooo slow"
636,2017-08-24T10:10:48.000314,Blanche,Not sure what direction to go with this
636,2017-08-24T10:13:12.000605,Suellen,"If you're familiar with databases, or have someone who is familiar with them, then why not - put stuff there. You basically get aggregations for free, and aggregations are a foundation for all reports."
636,2017-08-24T10:14:11.000129,Suellen,"On the other hand, `pandas` can load CSV data and make reports on the fly as well. No need for a database if it's not a whole lot of data ( &lt;10 GB)"
636,2017-08-24T10:21:22.000478,Meg,"differently, primarily by setting different variable values"
636,2017-08-24T10:21:31.000011,Blanche,"It'll all be text, so small... I don't have any familiarity with databases, so I'll check pandas out"
636,2017-08-24T10:21:32.000538,Meg,which are then later set to a django model field
636,2017-08-24T10:21:34.000701,Blanche,Thank you very much
636,2017-08-24T10:22:03.000116,Meg,that was the primary reason I split up into multiple try-except blocks
636,2017-08-24T10:23:29.000055,Beula,"Yeah, if anything is different I'd have the two separate handlers"
636,2017-08-24T11:14:25.000231,Winnifred,"<@Blanche>, if the project is very time-sensitive, I agree with <@Suellen> ‘s suggestion, but if you’re going to be doing this sort of thing regularly, it might be good to start learning databases by building out small jobs to extract and store your data."
637,2017-08-24T11:14:51.000465,Blanche,"It's not urgent, just trying to impress people :slightly_smiling_face:  Any specific place to start with a database?"
637,2017-08-24T11:16:35.000204,Winnifred,"I learned starting with mysql using <https://www.phpmyadmin.net/>, but you should also check out sqlite."
637,2017-08-24T11:19:08.000436,Suellen,&gt; mysql
637,2017-08-24T11:19:16.000426,Suellen,:rage::rage::rage:
637,2017-08-24T11:26:12.000257,Winnifred,I inherited the DB from a previous dev!
637,2017-08-24T11:32:31.000104,Meg,mysql is to <@Suellen> as mongo is to <@Patty>
637,2017-08-24T11:32:54.000517,Beula,Postgres for lyfe
637,2017-08-24T11:33:26.000674,Suellen,it's funny that postgres is more efficient with non-relational data than mongodb...
637,2017-08-24T11:33:35.000101,Suellen,a cruel joke almost
637,2017-08-24T11:35:05.000614,Vada,"The answer to most questions which contain the word ""data"" in them is ""postgres"""
637,2017-08-24T11:44:55.000814,Vada,Not that I can answer the Q
637,2017-08-24T11:45:11.000762,Ciera,not that much I think
637,2017-08-24T11:45:43.000475,Bruno,probably. i havent researched much of the difference between json/jsonb in postgres yet.
637,2017-08-24T11:45:51.000220,Vada,"`jsonb data is stored in a decomposed binary format that makes it slightly slower to input due to added conversion overhead, but significantly faster to process, since no reparsing is needed. jsonb also supports indexing, which can be a significant advantage.`"
637,2017-08-24T11:45:54.000238,Vada,from the docs
637,2017-08-24T11:46:00.000271,Vada,with indexing it could make a huge difference
637,2017-08-24T11:46:37.000266,Vada,100k is not very big in the db world <@Bruno>
637,2017-08-24T11:46:41.000069,Vada,xD
637,2017-08-24T11:46:58.000358,Ciera,<https://blog.2ndquadrant.com/jsonb-type-performance-postgresql-9-4/>
637,2017-08-24T11:47:04.000066,Bruno,oh i know. but if im already filtering by user...
637,2017-08-24T11:47:59.000180,Bruno,but i suppose there could be 1m after a lot of time. its for personal budgeting. so the the largest table would be all the bank transactions that come in.
637,2017-08-24T11:48:34.000411,Vada,which could get big very quickly
637,2017-08-24T11:49:34.000699,Bruno,yea.
637,2017-08-24T11:49:59.000176,Bruno,"granted, it will be a while before i get there and can come up with a plan later on. but yea."
637,2017-08-24T11:51:08.000179,Bruno,"so, this is what the transaction data coming in would look like <https://plaid.com/docs/api/#transactions>"
637,2017-08-24T11:53:35.000319,Bruno,yea.
637,2017-08-24T11:53:49.000163,Suellen,because pg can change a strategy for a query depending on quite a few factors
637,2017-08-24T11:53:59.000012,Bruno,and i plan on doing that. but im no DBA. so still asking for input and advice.
637,2017-08-24T11:54:18.000502,Suellen,we will help you :heart:
637,2017-08-24T11:54:55.000613,Bruno,im trying to get that transactions endpoint working by this evening.
637,2017-08-24T11:55:43.000185,Bruno,"chances are, i will probably be ok storing it in jsonb and just taking a few fields in the json and duping them as normal fields to make it easier to do some math operations."
638,2017-08-24T11:44:17.000406,Bruno,"how much less efficient is it to query records where a field is in a json type, compared to say a standard varchar field (assuming both are indexed)"
638,2017-08-24T11:45:03.000716,Vada,but it will depend on JSON vs JSONB right?
638,2017-08-24T11:45:56.000518,Bruno,yea. but what if theres 10k records. or 100k
638,2017-08-24T11:46:29.000767,Bruno,ah sounds like i would prefer jsonb then.
638,2017-08-24T11:52:19.000171,Winnifred,couldn’t `EXPLAIN` help you here ?
638,2017-08-24T11:53:24.000184,Suellen,"only post-factum, when you already have data and indexes"
639,2017-08-24T15:33:34.000025,Suellen,"you should use the first one everywhere, even in tests"
639,2017-08-24T15:33:45.000453,Suellen,i.e. absolute import
639,2017-08-24T15:34:01.000223,Suellen,what's your directory layout? are tests outside your package?
639,2017-08-24T15:47:33.000189,Bruno,"<@Signe> i may use waspy. its simple enough. also, when i ran the docker container with composer, it had an error related to rabbitmq"
639,2017-08-24T15:48:06.000309,Bruno,wrong channel anyways... <#C07G5276F|async>
640,2017-08-24T15:46:22.000164,Lester,the tests are in a directory along side the ClassUnderTest.py
640,2017-08-24T15:47:41.000048,Bruno,bleh
640,2017-08-24T15:48:33.000071,Lester,"ProjectName/ is root folder and contains an __init__.py, TextTools.py and ClassUnderTest.py, and a test/ folder with my unit tests"
640,2017-08-24T15:50:35.000068,Lester,"this is my first time creating my own modules so I maybe be doing something wrong, it's been working fine in my notebooks but ModuleNotFoundError's on ProjectName in tests"
640,2017-08-24T15:52:24.000142,Suellen,"so, generally the easiest layout is like this:"
640,2017-08-24T15:52:27.000100,Suellen,"```
tacticsiege
├── ProjectName
│   ├── stuff.py
│   └── textutils.py
└── tests
    ├── test_stuff.py
    └── test_textutils.py

2 directories, 4 files
```"
640,2017-08-24T15:52:48.000025,Suellen,"(forgot `__init__.py`, but you get an idea)"
640,2017-08-24T15:53:07.000533,Lester,"ok got it, my tests are too deep"
640,2017-08-24T15:53:35.000127,Suellen,this way you only ever use `from ProjectName.x import y`
640,2017-08-24T16:01:29.000266,Lester,thanks <@Suellen> that did the trick
640,2017-08-24T16:14:50.000195,Deedee,"`__init__.py` goes inside of `ProjectName`, right? What is `tactisiege` in your example <@Suellen> ?"
640,2017-08-24T16:15:25.000354,Suellen,"root project name, but yeah"
640,2017-08-24T16:15:44.000457,Suellen,`ProjectName` is a module so to speak
640,2017-08-24T16:15:46.000016,Bruno,__init__.py has to be in a folder in order for the python interpreter to be able to see into that dir and load files from it as modules
640,2017-08-24T16:16:38.000124,Deedee,that makes sense. thx
640,2017-08-24T16:21:39.000228,Lester,"fwiw, I was also able to leave tests where they were (under ProjectName/) by adding .. to my env's search path"
640,2017-08-24T16:22:21.000512,Suellen,that's... not great
640,2017-08-24T16:22:45.000336,Lester,oh yea? I was afraid you'd say that cause I like it better :-X
640,2017-08-24T16:22:50.000352,Suellen,"changing system path isn't really a nice solution, only temporarily"
640,2017-08-24T16:24:25.000415,Lester,"if I understand it correctly, I only changed it in my virtualenv that the unit tests run in not system level, still not the greatest?"
640,2017-08-24T16:25:25.000024,Suellen,what if you distribute this package to users?
640,2017-08-24T16:25:29.000229,Lester,I have to cd into the tacticsiege/ directory in my notebooks before I import but that's fine
640,2017-08-24T16:25:33.000167,Suellen,you can't really expect them to modify their paths
640,2017-08-24T16:26:11.000155,Lester,"yes, understood, bummer... had a bad smell to it but saves me a project in my larger solution file"
640,2017-08-24T16:32:32.000213,Ashly,"Can someone please tell me why I am getting these results?

640,2017-08-24T16:36:51.000055,Suellen,In Python 2 exactly what you get
640,2017-08-24T16:37:56.000051,Ashly,i'm trying to work out a bug where that smiley shows up as 4 question marks in an email. which is probably because it gets translated to those four hex values
640,2017-08-24T16:38:02.000279,Ashly,any pointers?
640,2017-08-24T16:38:18.000179,Suellen,python2 only?
640,2017-08-24T16:38:21.000325,Ashly,yep
640,2017-08-24T16:39:12.000114,Suellen,"you need to make sure you treat text as unicode when you get it from user, for example, but as soon as you need to send it, it should be properly encoded to bytes"
640,2017-08-24T16:39:30.000309,Suellen,"emails are bytes, AFAIK"
640,2017-08-24T16:40:59.000350,Suellen,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; email_body = 'hey 🙂'
&gt;&gt;&gt; email_body

640,2017-08-24T16:42:20.000242,Ashly,"this works:
```
(Pdb) print 'hey 🙂'
hey 🙂
```"
640,2017-08-24T16:42:33.000469,Ashly,there is no such thing as converting a string to bytes in python2.7 no?
640,2017-08-24T16:43:04.000125,Chester,I’m kind of tempted to update conda as root?
640,2017-08-24T16:43:20.000059,Suellen,"<@Ashly> there is no such thing, correct, and that's why all the mess"
640,2017-08-24T16:43:34.000235,Suellen,strings are bytes and bytes are strings by default
640,2017-08-24T16:44:00.000289,Suellen,the only sane way is convert them as soon as they cross a boundary in your system
640,2017-08-24T16:44:53.000387,Suellen,"as for ""this works"", here let me show you an example"

640,2017-08-24T16:51:49.000129,Ashly,ok but encoding it in unicode won't work as `email.body` is already unicode. i get `TypeError: decoding Unicode is not supported`
640,2017-08-24T16:52:20.000434,Suellen,oh :smile:
640,2017-08-24T16:53:02.000137,Suellen,"so, how do you send it?"
640,2017-08-24T16:53:08.000202,Suellen,the last steps..
640,2017-08-24T16:55:22.000087,Ashly,when i fetch it from the db it shows up like that too
640,2017-08-24T16:55:39.000663,Suellen,"no, it's OK"

640,2017-08-24T19:03:21.000273,Bruno,"it depends on where you make the request. in postman it will show the response. if in the terminal, it will spit out the response when done (httpie is great for this). in a python script, there should be some response object you can get the results from. how you access that will depend on what library you are using to make the request. In order for people know better answer, it helps to have a sample of what you are doing. <@Hyman>"
640,2017-08-24T19:17:21.000085,Beula,"<@Hyman> on the response object. It will be as `.json()` if the response is a Json one, otherwise I think `.data()` both are covered in the docs "

This app is creating an object which calls another class' _init_ and then later modifies the variables within based on a config file. When a function from that particular class is called, it uses the init values, not the ones assigned outside the class. 

Clearly this is some kind of scoping issue but understand it well enough to explain it to my colleague. :confused:"
644,2017-08-25T03:03:47.000102,Collette,<@Dell> can you show us the code?
644,2017-08-25T03:05:36.000100,Dell,technically no but I kind of boiled it down to the essence here
644,2017-08-25T03:07:03.000311,Dell,"so where this json is loading and setting it, that works - but when _run_ is called those assignments don't exist"
644,2017-08-25T03:07:25.000186,Dell,it just goes back to None
644,2017-08-25T03:24:32.000019,Dell,ahhh yeah that's much more straightforward
644,2017-08-25T03:25:28.000188,Collette,"AFAIK when you edit a message with taco, the tacobot can't notice that"
644,2017-08-25T03:25:33.000139,Dell,noooo
644,2017-08-25T03:25:39.000233,Dell,<@Collette> :taco:

644,2017-08-25T03:26:07.000046,Ramona,Finally I understand how the taco bot works...
644,2017-08-25T03:26:22.000073,Dell,hahaha :stars: the more you know...

644,2017-08-25T05:39:25.000287,Assunta,thanks
644,2017-08-25T05:39:43.000204,Assunta,yes please. I need help on how to ensure to align my team in python development
644,2017-08-25T05:39:57.000153,Assunta,because I am preparing all the process materials we need
644,2017-08-25T05:40:10.000103,Ramona,<@Junita> isn't the flavor of the month pylint? Is there any significant difference between flake8 and pylint?

644,2017-08-25T05:41:36.000286,Meg,not on alpine
644,2017-08-25T05:41:49.000049,Meg,make a docker image
644,2017-08-25T05:41:53.000363,Meg,accept the slow build time
644,2017-08-25T05:41:57.000207,Meg,deploy to docker hub
644,2017-08-25T05:42:04.000206,Assunta,how about unit testing any idea?
644,2017-08-25T05:42:09.000045,Junita,so it’s been a while since I’ve looked into this stuff.
644,2017-08-25T05:42:10.000201,Meg,and use that image
644,2017-08-25T05:42:15.000371,Ciera,hmm. could you built your own wheel and upload on your own devpi or something ?
644,2017-08-25T05:42:19.000004,Leigh,hmm
644,2017-08-25T05:42:23.000047,Ciera,but not sure that easier to do
644,2017-08-25T05:42:33.000302,Leigh,i'm already using multi-staged builds to make it fast
644,2017-08-25T05:42:50.000048,Ciera,<@Assunta> standard library unittest module or pytest
644,2017-08-25T05:42:57.000246,Leigh,"then, another way of question: how to determine all the file list that is created by the build process of a wheel?"
644,2017-08-25T05:43:10.000203,Junita,"yeah I think pytest is the common thing these days.  there again I’m out of date, using nose still"
644,2017-08-25T05:43:33.000307,Ciera,yeah pytest is the common one
644,2017-08-25T05:43:46.000110,Assunta,thanks <@Ciera>
644,2017-08-25T05:44:21.000131,Assunta,I will look on it. since I am not aware in python. I used in Ruby Rspec and TDD. using codeship
644,2017-08-25T05:44:39.000174,Assunta,but will look fully on it
644,2017-08-25T05:44:44.000177,Assunta,thanks guys for the details.
644,2017-08-25T05:44:53.000175,Leigh,"i'm already doing like this:
```
FROM python:3.6-alpine as python-source
RUN cd /; tar czpf python.tar.gz /usr/local/

FROM myimage:latest
COPY --from=python-source /python.tar.gz /
RUN cd /; tar xzpf python.tar.gz
```"
644,2017-08-25T05:45:01.000342,Ciera,pytest might have somehting for TDD (but not sure I don't use it)
644,2017-08-25T05:45:15.000015,Leigh,"maybe if i can do the same for cython/scipy/pandas/..., it will be great"
644,2017-08-25T05:46:30.000207,Assunta,"<@Ciera> ok, but is there anyway to have a continuous development that includes unit testing? I found this book: <http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/praise.harry.html> using django"
644,2017-08-25T05:46:49.000171,Assunta,but I am not sure If I am on the right track
644,2017-08-25T05:46:51.000178,Ciera,that depend on your CI
644,2017-08-25T05:47:01.000057,Junita,yeah that’s more of a process question than a tools question
644,2017-08-25T05:47:03.000033,Ciera,you might also want to look into `tox`
644,2017-08-25T05:47:38.000057,Ciera,`Gives boto a facelift` Nice one :smile:
644,2017-08-25T05:47:44.000086,Junita,heh
644,2017-08-25T05:49:33.000110,Leigh,"so, would it be sufficient to zip &amp; copy the package directory (e.g., `/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy`), with some tweaks on pkg-info files"
644,2017-08-25T05:49:39.000128,Suellen,"<@Leigh> <https://github.com/cython/cython/blob/7af5d3e92a59906927a566e5dc4a99eeaca49b96/.travis.yml>
It seems that CFLAGS can be passed easily for Cython build"
644,2017-08-25T05:49:47.000356,Suellen,But I couldn't find anything standard
644,2017-08-25T05:50:11.000415,Leigh,CFLAGS are for individual c compiler invocations
644,2017-08-25T05:50:23.000201,Suellen,"yes, of course"
644,2017-08-25T05:50:36.000198,Suellen,I wonder if it's possible to pass MAKEOPTS this way
644,2017-08-25T05:50:58.000106,Leigh,setuptools seems not to use makefile at all
644,2017-08-25T05:50:59.000267,Suellen,"there's a `--global-option` and `--install-option` for pip, but these options are passed to `setup.py` and it must deal with those -- again not standard"
644,2017-08-25T05:51:17.000201,Leigh,"tried, but only some packages have their own specific options via that interface"
644,2017-08-25T05:51:34.000102,Leigh,there seems to be no general way
644,2017-08-25T05:51:35.000394,Leigh,:disappointed:
644,2017-08-25T05:52:10.000202,Suellen,yeah :disappointed:
644,2017-08-25T05:52:10.000266,Leigh,hm
644,2017-08-25T05:52:35.000029,Leigh,i think i should go for separate image builds (either using multi-staged or different images) to build wheels for alpine linux
644,2017-08-25T05:52:40.000086,Suellen,"haha, you can override `make` to point to an alias `make -j4`"
644,2017-08-25T05:52:44.000148,Suellen,but that's crazy
644,2017-08-25T05:52:59.000272,Suellen,"but, I mean... if it works.."

644,2017-08-25T05:59:00.000055,Meg,"its a little out of date, but perhaps you can use the context within to make progress?"
644,2017-08-25T06:00:28.000006,Leigh,oh... thanks for the reference!
644,2017-08-25T06:07:49.000038,Suellen,<@Leigh> turns out `cython` doesn't use `make` at all
645,2017-08-25T03:13:32.000043,Collette,"That is really bad code, but it should work as you showed: <https://ideone.com/4K0N7E>"

647,2017-08-25T05:40:55.000366,Ciera,<@Ramona> I don't thing there is. But I'm not a big user of them. I usually just put flake8 with a little bit of options and that's all
647,2017-08-25T05:41:59.000073,Junita,<@Ramona> quite possible.  once I have that kinda stuff going on a project it tends to stay that way

I cloned my bitbucket repo to my 2nd machine, did some changes that I wasn't happy with. Now I wanna discard those changes and clone the master branch and work on that. 
Can I just remove the whole project folder on my 2nd machine (django project, venv and git repo and all) and just clone the master repo, set up a new venv and start again? Or is it some other recommended way of doing it?"

650,2017-08-25T09:22:33.000272,Meg,but ES/Solr are pretty similar in use cases

652,2017-08-25T09:50:42.000667,Herta,basically i want for example to query ES data index via Python/Jupyter. Is elasticsearch-py worth trying?
652,2017-08-25T09:53:31.000645,Collette,<@Herta> you could actually try it instead of asking here if you should try it. I bet you'd spend a similar amount of time :slightly_smiling_face:

I just used `pyinstaller` and that worked great but the output was a little sloppy (a bunch of files, the .exe hidden in the dist folder). It's not bad but I'm wondering if there's a cleaner option for the end user? Thanks!"
656,2017-08-25T12:41:07.000035,Suellen,`pyinstaller --onefile`
656,2017-08-25T12:41:11.000349,Suellen,or is it `--one-file`...
656,2017-08-25T12:41:34.000276,Suellen,"anyways, it will be one single executable"
656,2017-08-25T12:41:39.000277,Beula,<@Dominick> how'd you invoke it? You can do `--onefile` and just share the one .exe
656,2017-08-25T12:43:26.000300,Dominick,<@Suellen> <@Beula> Ahhhh didn't know about that - I should probably read the documentation first...thanks guys
657,2017-08-25T14:02:54.000078,Irish,"Hey there, I'm looking to test some custom commands and wondering if there's a way to reload a command once I'm already inside shell? ie:

```
&gt; python manage.py shell
&gt; from django.core import management
&gt; management.call_command('get_embeds')
&gt; # make some changes to file
&gt; # reload command
&gt; management.call_command('get_embeds')
```
We're running on a vagrant VM so running something such as `python manage.py get_embeds` takes a bit of time to load each time I want to test the script. 

thanks!"

659,2017-08-25T17:34:33.000097,Chester,I guess it comes down to the fact that the user doesn’t have permissions on /anaconda

660,2017-08-25T18:24:22.000088,Berry,<@Bruno> is right

661,2017-08-26T17:21:06.000026,Vita,Oh I am also using docker so the issue isn't coming from something I have installed
661,2017-08-26T17:21:31.000004,Suellen,<@Vita> what's your commandline
661,2017-08-26T17:21:39.000083,Suellen,i.e. how do you launch gunicorn
661,2017-08-26T17:23:00.000066,Vita,sec
661,2017-08-26T17:25:19.000031,Suellen,and you totally have `myapp/app.py` with `def create_app()` inside?
661,2017-08-26T17:26:03.000073,Vita,"yep! It was working last time I tried, but I finally fixed other errors and now it won't work (this has been going on for about a month)"
661,2017-08-26T17:26:15.000047,Suellen,"btw, I suggest a different approach, because strangely this method doesn't work for me"
661,2017-08-26T17:26:38.000042,Suellen,"what I did was:
1. created `wsgi.py` in project root"

from projectname.app import create_app

app = create_app() # pass something in, I dunno

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```"
661,2017-08-26T17:27:35.000017,Suellen,and then `gunicorn wsgi:app` works alright
661,2017-08-26T17:27:47.000055,Vita,hmmm let me try that to see if it works
661,2017-08-26T17:33:04.000032,Vita,"<@Suellen> sweet! That did it! I am getting another error now, but I should be able to fix it!"

661,2017-08-26T17:33:52.000074,Suellen,cool
661,2017-08-26T21:07:52.000016,Suellen,not docker related
661,2017-08-26T21:08:21.000034,Suellen,if your server works and you can connect to it -- docker already did its part
661,2017-08-27T07:11:31.000032,Vita,<@Suellen> ok thanks
661,2017-08-27T07:15:03.000060,Suellen,did you find the culprit?
661,2017-08-27T07:23:27.000026,Suellen,other pages are accessible?
661,2017-08-27T07:35:39.000046,Suellen,`create_app()` should take care of all that
661,2017-08-27T07:36:12.000011,Suellen,"your app should also work the same when using Flask debug server, or gunicorn, or any combination"
661,2017-08-27T07:36:22.000027,Suellen,otherwise something isn't right
661,2017-08-27T07:38:16.000014,Vita,Hmmm not sure where i broke it at though....I'll continue to look and let ya know when I have found something

662,2017-08-26T20:10:33.000011,Vita,oh it is a flask app
662,2017-08-27T07:20:54.000029,Vita,"Nope, still looking for the issue causer"
662,2017-08-27T07:25:02.000013,Vita,"Nope, but I think I may have found the culprit...i am not importing my views into wsgi, gonna see if that fixes it"
662,2017-08-27T07:31:00.000014,Vita,alright that wasnt the issue (i am using blueprints)
663,2017-08-27T09:41:13.000100,Thomasina,Does it matter whether I `CREATE EXTENSION postgis;` before or after creating the rest of the tables in my database?
663,2017-08-27T09:50:08.000027,Suellen,"if you haven't created an extension, how would you use types from it in your table columns?"
663,2017-08-27T11:03:00.000018,Thomasina,"<@Suellen> uhhh.....magic, of course."

663,2017-08-27T11:22:36.000034,Thomasina,Looks perfectly fine to me
663,2017-08-27T11:24:21.000054,Thomasina,"Oh wait, is `::geography` an SQL and not a Python thing?"
663,2017-08-27T11:25:01.000031,Suellen,it is :slightly_smiling_face:
663,2017-08-27T11:25:19.000028,Suellen,probably even postgres specific
663,2017-08-27T11:25:24.000066,Thomasina,"Ah, ok, my bad"
663,2017-08-27T12:13:44.000032,Thomasina,"`cast(geom, Geography)` is supposedly the way to do it but it doesn't work because `name 'cast' is not defined` but I don't know why and there are literally no relevant results when I search. :confused:"

663,2017-08-27T12:14:22.000108,Suellen,I'm not 100% certain
663,2017-08-27T12:15:27.000025,Meg,You need to work with sql and not python for that 
663,2017-08-27T12:15:57.000026,Suellen,doesn't GeoAlchemy provide helpers?
663,2017-08-27T12:16:11.000045,Meg,"I'm on mobile so don't have the links handy, but postgis has exactly the same queries you're looking for"
663,2017-08-27T12:16:41.000003,Meg,"If it's anything like geodjango, it implements some but not the entire feature set"
663,2017-08-27T12:16:47.000104,Thomasina,<@Suellen> Of course! I was just uhhh...testing your knowledge! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
663,2017-08-27T12:17:00.000079,Thomasina,<@Suellen> :taco:
663,2017-08-27T12:17:19.000101,Thomasina,"<@Meg> `cast(geom, Geography)` seems to be the way to do it with Geoalchemy"
663,2017-08-27T12:17:35.000058,Meg,Sweet!
663,2017-08-27T12:18:08.000047,Meg,There's certainly a learning curve to figure what's been implemented in the orm and what hasn't.
663,2017-08-27T12:18:52.000067,Meg,"For example, geodjango doesn't have any clustering built into it, but you can do it with postgis once you install the nearest neighbor extension "
663,2017-08-27T12:32:47.000089,Thomasina,Definitely. I figured out how to do what I wanted to do using SQL in the command line but didn't realize it'd be a bit different in Python.
663,2017-08-27T12:33:06.000019,Meg,It will be
663,2017-08-27T12:33:22.000063,Meg,Because geoalchemy has its own interface to use
663,2017-08-27T12:33:52.000068,Meg,So you'll have to translate from a working sql call to how geoalchemy does it
664,2017-08-27T19:08:46.000001,Vita,<@Suellen> the issue was the wrong server name in my instance folder

671,2017-08-29T07:42:39.000007,Patty,It allows reuse of an address/port before waiting for the socket `TIME_WAIT`
671,2017-08-29T07:43:20.000060,Shelly,"Yeah, I saw loads of ports going to `TIME_WAIT`"
671,2017-08-29T07:44:08.000285,Ciera,it means you open multiple time the same socket
671,2017-08-29T07:44:21.000037,Patty,"It should, alternatively you can kill and restart whatever is using that port"
671,2017-08-29T07:45:10.000029,Shelly,I have multiple python projects using the same db

671,2017-08-29T07:49:01.000056,Patty,i’d look into reducing the `TIME_WAIT` on sockets in windows (not sure where that would be)
671,2017-08-29T07:49:10.000144,Patty,I’d also take a look at what processes have that port open when the error occurs
671,2017-08-29T07:49:22.000105,Patty,the latter will show you if something is holding that connection open

671,2017-08-29T07:55:03.000066,Patty,"No problem, and like <@Gabriele> said, the `netstat` command is your friend here"
671,2017-08-29T07:55:25.000004,Shelly,"Anyways, I will check the issue. Thanks a lot for your time. <@Patty> <@Ciera> <@Gabriele> :taco: :taco:"
671,2017-08-29T07:56:36.000194,Shelly,"Yeah, I tried checking that out, couldn't understand the things. Need to improve my knowledge on the same :neutral_face:"
671,2017-08-29T07:57:51.000095,Patty,"It’s a good thing to poke around with and get familiar with, so getting around this issue will be a good learning experience :slightly_smiling_face:"

673,2017-08-29T14:34:02.000410,Suellen,put some print statements in `worker` :slightly_smiling_face:
673,2017-08-29T14:34:23.000224,Suellen,"wait, no..."
673,2017-08-29T14:36:40.000282,Patty,<@Tameika> can you share the code that you are running?
673,2017-08-29T14:37:57.000248,Suellen,actually print statements will work
673,2017-08-29T14:38:10.000083,Suellen,"I know it's a stupid way, but it takes literally 10 seconds"
673,2017-08-29T14:38:39.000101,Suellen,"First verify that your function works standalone, without multiprocessing."
673,2017-08-29T14:38:53.000389,Patty,well is `worker` a function?
673,2017-08-29T14:38:57.000060,Tameika,"yes, that's the first step indeed"
673,2017-08-29T14:39:02.000628,Tameika,yes <@Patty> it is a function
673,2017-08-29T14:39:34.000516,Patty,well without further context this is a bit tricky. sharing your code helps a lot

674,2017-08-29T15:14:13.000333,Ciera,<@Beula> we should create jslackers and then conquer the world
674,2017-08-29T15:14:55.000435,Beula,I have zero desire to deal with that churn :joy:
674,2017-08-29T15:15:03.000040,Beula,`sirbot.js`
674,2017-08-29T15:15:09.000024,Beula,I think we have something though
674,2017-08-29T15:15:29.000483,Meghan,"Trying to figure out kivy, and it is fun.

I'm using a RecycleView, following the instructions found here: <https://kivy.org/docs/api-kivy.uix.recycleview.html>

Unfortunately, I don't see a way to get selected items. Rather, I can get a all items, but nothing that says they are selected. There is the callback for when an item is selected, and I could populate my own dictionary as they are selected, but it would be preferable to access a property that returns just the selected. Anyone know how to do this?"
674,2017-08-29T15:16:12.000162,Ciera,but maybe that way we could have a nice looking website :troll: :smile: :smile:
674,2017-08-29T15:16:39.000005,Beula,hahaha
674,2017-08-29T15:16:46.000049,Beula,It's pretty thanks to Mike's fiverr
674,2017-08-29T15:17:11.000492,Ciera,I wis I had the time to take a deeper look at kivy
674,2017-08-29T15:18:10.000243,Meghan,"It's interesting. Lots and lots of objects. But, I got tired of trying to figure out tkinter's issues, so thought Kivy would be more interesting."
674,2017-08-29T15:18:37.000313,Beula,Kivy seems really interesting for rpi based displays and stuff
674,2017-08-29T15:19:15.000714,Ciera,I played a bit with tkinter and Qt when I was starting python
674,2017-08-29T15:19:19.000525,Ciera,it was interesting
674,2017-08-29T15:19:31.000491,Ciera,but yeah now I stick to cli :smile:
674,2017-08-29T15:20:08.000098,Beula,I did wxpython - it was the best one I could find to do menubar style widgets
674,2017-08-29T15:20:40.000103,Meghan,"I do almost all of my programming for cli, but for this program I think a gui is appropriate for my user base. It would be a rather complex cli interface if I were to try it there."
674,2017-08-29T15:21:56.000553,Meghan,"```    def apply_selection(self, rv, index, is_selected):
        """""" Respond to the selection of items in the view. """"""
        self.selected = is_selected
        if is_selected:
            print(""selection changed to {0}"".format(rv.data[index]))
        else:
            print(""selection removed for {0}"".format(rv.data[index]))```

This is the example they give, and I could use that to build a dictionary of what is selected. Given that what is selected is on the screen at all times though, I would expect that would be an option from the start. I don't see anything relevant in dir(object) though."
674,2017-08-29T15:24:17.000482,Ciera,it seems to be triggered by an event
674,2017-08-29T15:24:25.000483,Meghan,Right.
674,2017-08-29T15:24:56.000247,Ciera,so I guess everytime you select or unselect something this function got triggered
674,2017-08-29T15:25:23.000640,Ciera,or maybe you need to bind it somehow to a specific check box
674,2017-08-29T15:25:25.000112,Meghan,"Exactly.
```selection removed for {'text': 'DSL'}
selection changed to {'text': 'EVC-Maps Statuses'}```"
674,2017-08-29T15:26:12.000218,Ciera,oh ok I just re-read your initial question. my bad.
674,2017-08-29T15:26:15.000418,Ciera,well I don't know :smile:
674,2017-08-29T15:27:02.000256,Meghan,I'm thinking I'll add a callback to it that updates a dictionary in the rv object then just retrieve from there. Would think that would be something they would have included though.
674,2017-08-29T15:27:35.000457,Ciera,myabe there is something to get all checkbox and then you can just find the one you want in those ? selected or not
674,2017-08-29T15:29:00.000394,Meghan,It's actually a listbox type of interface.
674,2017-08-29T15:29:40.000167,Meghan,"But, I think I'll just add a callback into the RV object and maintain a dictionary there."
674,2017-08-29T15:30:10.000290,Meghan,"As you can see from the screenshot, user interface design is not my specialty."
674,2017-08-29T15:31:24.000446,Ciera,:smile: it's better than mine
674,2017-08-29T15:34:44.000108,Meghan,"One nice thing though, that box in the bottom right formats using restructured text. So, pretty formatting that should be easy."
674,2017-08-29T15:35:15.000139,Ciera,ooh nice
674,2017-08-29T15:35:28.000229,Ciera,be carefull some here would prefer markdown :smile: :troll:
674,2017-08-29T15:35:42.000589,Beula,:rage5:
674,2017-08-29T15:36:01.000077,Meghan,"lol, I am more comfortable with markdown, but I saw the rst box, don't know if they have a md text formatter. I can learn rst for this though."
674,2017-08-29T15:36:46.000293,Beula,"RST is pretty nice, it's a lot more flexible than MD as far as output formats - that's a big reason it is a thing (afaik)"
675,2017-08-29T17:59:23.000223,Diana,Hey guys I want to contribute to open source. Can anyone point me right direction to start
675,2017-08-29T18:00:08.000388,Johana,"<#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects>, we have 2 projects that are open source with lots of issues of all sorts of difficulty."
675,2017-08-29T18:00:50.000354,Beula,"How much python do you know? A lot of projects always want help with:

1. Documentation
2. Testing
3. Features

We have a few, as <@Johana> mentioned, otherwise there is always any library you like/use that can probably use help"
676,2017-08-29T18:13:00.000030,Melinda,Is anybody here familiar with lowess/loess surface fitting?
676,2017-08-29T18:28:48.000234,Bonita,"In this example, should the function always be like `_()`?
Can it return a named function instead? If so, how would I do that?

```
def raise_to_input(exponent):
    # '_' is the function that's being returned, which is then assigned to a name.
    def _(base):
        return base ** exponent
    return _
```

```
print(raise_to_input(3))
# &lt;function raise_to_input.&lt;locals&gt;._ at 0x10a77a730&gt;
input_base_new_function = raise_to_input(3)
print(type(input_base_new_function))
# &lt;class 'function'&gt;
print(input_base_new_function(10))
# 1000 = 10 ** 3
print(input_base_new_function(2))
# 8 = 2 ** 3
```"
676,2017-08-29T18:30:13.000049,Beula,<@Bonita> - did you try it? You can name the function (but really it gets re-assigned when you do `foo = raise_to_input(x)`)
676,2017-08-29T18:30:30.000142,Beula,What are you really wanting to accomplish?
676,2017-08-29T18:32:40.000256,Bonita,"<@Beula> I did attempt it, but received an error. If the work (assignment) gets done in that step, than it’s necessary to leave it in. I was just looking for a way to remove that step. I don’t have a direct application for it at the moment. I’m just learning the concept. Thanks for the help."
676,2017-08-29T18:33:38.000423,Bonita,"<@Beula> Like, maybe, adding the name of the returned (newly minted) function as an input parameter, for instance."
676,2017-08-29T18:34:21.000125,Beula,"oh, you want a dynamic ""name"" `func.__name__`?"
676,2017-08-29T18:34:45.000176,Beula,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; def foobar():
...   pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; foobar.__name__
'foobar'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foobar.__name__ = 'baz'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foobar
&lt;function foobar at 0x102d29f28&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; foobar.__name__
'baz'
```"
676,2017-08-29T18:35:03.000193,Bonita,"<@Beula> I think so, but am unclear on the terminology. I’m experimenting with it to try to figure-out how that works."
676,2017-08-29T18:36:00.000303,Beula,"To answer the original question, you can return any function object:

```
def foo():
    def baz(v):
        print('value:', v)
    return baz
```

If that is what you are going for"
676,2017-08-29T18:42:49.000045,Bonita,"<@Beula> ```def foo():
    def baz(v):
        z = v + 7
        print('value:', z)
    return baz

print(foo())
# &lt;function foo.&lt;locals&gt;.baz at 0x1084b9840&gt;
print(baz(3))``` It raises a NameError over `baz`. While, ```baz = foo()
print(baz(5))``` provides `value: 12`. Am I understanding correctly that it’s not possible to remove the assignment step `baz = foo()`?"
676,2017-08-29T18:43:32.000134,Beula,Correct due to scoping rules
676,2017-08-29T18:43:59.000381,Beula,baz is defined in a nested scope that's not visible to you after it's returned 
676,2017-08-29T18:44:38.000275,Bonita,<@Beula> Great. Thanks. That makes it clear.
677,2017-08-30T04:32:35.000039,Anastacia,Hi guys is there anyone around that can help me out?
677,2017-08-30T04:34:07.000105,Anastacia,"I'm working on a technical test I was given.  I completed the test, and my code works.
I've been asked however to make it installable via pip.
I'm abit confused as to the process.
I created a setup.py, I've uploaded it to pypi (<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/boggle2/0.1>)
and you can install it using pip
```pip install boggle2```"
677,2017-08-30T04:35:06.000261,Anastacia,"but as ive never done this before, I'm not sure what is the end goal here?  Is it that once you ```pip install boggle2``` you won't need to download the code from my github repo?"
677,2017-08-30T04:35:31.000170,Ciera,exactly
677,2017-08-30T04:35:51.000117,Ciera,then you can `import boggle2` in your python repl or script
677,2017-08-30T04:36:06.000235,Anastacia,ok and once you run import boggle2 you can run my code?
677,2017-08-30T04:36:39.000229,Ciera,and quick tips you should .gitignore the `__pycache__` dir :slightly_smiling_face:
677,2017-08-30T04:37:28.000369,Ciera,"yeah then you should be able to do
```
import boggle2

boggle2.board_generate()
```
for example"
677,2017-08-30T04:37:35.000282,Anastacia,"ok, so I created a virtualenv to test it out.
I did the 
```pip install boggle2```
ran python

677,2017-08-30T04:42:59.000046,Anastacia,Ok
677,2017-08-30T04:43:21.000475,Anastacia,Does the file structure when I uploaded to pypi matter?
677,2017-08-30T04:43:27.000327,Ciera,you need something like `    packages=find_packages()` in your setup.py
677,2017-08-30T04:43:36.000158,Anastacia,ok
677,2017-08-30T04:43:41.000485,Ciera,and `from setuptools import find_packages` at the top
677,2017-08-30T04:44:08.000164,Ciera,otherwise it doesn't know what packages it bundle
677,2017-08-30T04:45:12.000226,Anastacia,"ok so
```packages=['boggle2', 'test_boggle'],```"
677,2017-08-30T04:45:16.000036,Anastacia,something like that?
677,2017-08-30T04:45:21.000467,Anastacia,and the import statement at the top
677,2017-08-30T04:45:45.000207,Ciera,`find_packages()` should be enough
677,2017-08-30T04:45:51.000202,Ciera,it should autofind your package
677,2017-08-30T04:46:18.000149,Anastacia,"ok, so ill upload again, and then when I create a virtualenv and pip install, I should be able to import boggle2"
677,2017-08-30T04:46:24.000125,Ciera,but you might need to have your script in a directory

677,2017-08-30T04:46:46.000001,Ciera,not sure if it's mandatory or not

677,2017-08-30T05:27:06.000090,Anastacia,"a user runs ```pip install boggle_checker```

They then need to go to the directory where pip installed it to be able to import it and run it?"

677,2017-08-30T05:48:06.000247,Gabriele,Okay. I think the issue is perhaps that you have a boggle module inside the boggle package
677,2017-08-30T05:48:20.000308,Gabriele,You might need to use it like `from boggle import boggle` or similar

680,2017-08-30T07:23:05.000339,Carri,is it Python 2 or 3 ? as your Line#71 is Py2.x style while the rest are Py3.x style
680,2017-08-30T07:23:54.000117,Shirl,Python 3
680,2017-08-30T07:24:21.000293,Shirl,"yeah i guess i forgot () around print statement, changed it now"
680,2017-08-30T07:24:39.000099,Shirl,still nothing
680,2017-08-30T07:28:43.000166,Carri,the code looks correct to me
680,2017-08-30T07:30:47.000004,Beula,I'd use a debugger and step through to find where it gets stuck (pdb or whatever is built into your editor/ide)
680,2017-08-30T07:31:14.000216,Beula,That's better than any of us guessing what is going on
681,2017-08-30T08:00:04.000370,Meg,"or if you don't have a remote debugger connection set up, use print statements or log to a file on the raspi"
681,2017-08-30T08:22:22.000104,Beula,Where did you put the pdb statement?
681,2017-08-30T08:39:59.000111,Ciera,well what does that is wiating for ?  `pygame.event.get()`
681,2017-08-30T08:40:20.000125,Patty,^^ this. are you triggering any events that would go to the pygame queue?
681,2017-08-30T08:49:35.000290,Ciera,<@Mendy> we have a <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channels for question regarding django :slightly_smiling_face:

682,2017-08-30T08:00:27.000459,Sean,"Hello, what would be the easiest way to approach over simple application? I have too many options to choose from, so I get so confused.
Image gallery, with functionality: everyone can see images, admin can see add remove edit. Images/posts contain info, title, image etc

So very simple; what I know I need pretty much is Flask, authentication, somewhere to upload them (?) and fetch them and show them.

So, what I was thinking is using s3, flask with some authentication, any better ideas on the workflow?"
682,2017-08-30T08:01:05.000351,Sean,"Haven't really deployed any python apps so I am a bit confused. Although, I once did deploy one to my on VPS, but it was quite a mess to hassle round with UWSGI + other"
682,2017-08-30T08:01:41.000220,Ciera,if it's simple flask is a good way to go :slightly_smiling_face:
682,2017-08-30T08:02:04.000086,Ciera,(and if it's more complex it's also a good way)
682,2017-08-30T08:02:52.000281,Sean,"yeah, heh. I always overcomplicate simple stuff"
682,2017-08-30T08:03:01.000160,Meg,<@Shirl> can you confirm that keypress events are being received in your code?
682,2017-08-30T08:03:14.000060,Meg,<@Sean> that's pretty easy to do!
682,2017-08-30T08:03:50.000073,Meg,thats where communities like this are handy
682,2017-08-30T08:03:57.000200,Junita,<@Sean> one thing to look at - you can pass signed urls to the client and have them upload the images directly to s3 so they don’t have to go through your server
682,2017-08-30T08:04:27.000194,Sean,"<@Junita> something like this is exactly what I was hoping for - even ignoring the whole server part all in all, but is this possible?"
682,2017-08-30T08:04:45.000250,Meg,"well, you need some way to have auth, right?"
682,2017-08-30T08:04:52.000055,Ciera,you would still need a flask + postgres behind
682,2017-08-30T08:04:53.000111,Sean,for the admin to upload - yes.
682,2017-08-30T08:04:57.000443,Sean,<@Ciera> exactly
682,2017-08-30T08:05:05.000102,Sean,where do I keep that then? also in AWS?
682,2017-08-30T08:05:07.000349,Junita,"well, you *can* do auth using lambda and their cognito service"
682,2017-08-30T08:05:51.000076,Meg,"one downside with direct to s3 upload is you're relying on the client for the upload, and bypassing restrictions can be done"
682,2017-08-30T08:05:57.000077,Junita,might be easier to start thought just doing a simple flask app
682,2017-08-30T08:06:19.000081,Meg,"if you do it server side, that's trickier to work around, and you'll be able to store metrics and other info about the uploads/images"
682,2017-08-30T08:06:36.000277,Junita,<@Meg> when you create the signed url you can restrict it to that specific file upload
682,2017-08-30T08:07:01.000007,Ciera,<@Junita> I like your proposition when he just said `I always overcomplicate simple stuff` :smile: :smile:

682,2017-08-30T08:07:26.000106,Shirl,"<@Meg> uhm not really, i’m trying to use debugger but not sure how to do that either"
682,2017-08-30T08:07:53.000085,Junita,"in a sense it actually simplifies it, but the big issue is it’s easier to get help with a simple flask app than running the world via lambda  :stuck_out_tongue:"
682,2017-08-30T08:09:07.000034,Meg,"<@Shirl>, are you using something like pycharm to write your code?"
682,2017-08-30T08:09:40.000026,Shirl,no i’m actually writing it in atom and testing it on Rpi through ssh
682,2017-08-30T08:10:15.000057,Meg,"ok, that makes things a little trickier"
682,2017-08-30T08:10:24.000356,Meg,you should look at how to set up a remote python debugger with atom
682,2017-08-30T08:10:50.000439,Sean,"ill be back in little over an hour, let's see what i've came up with :slightly_smiling_face: see you soon :palm_tree:"
682,2017-08-30T08:11:19.000087,Meg,<https://atom.io/packages/python-debugger>
682,2017-08-30T08:11:42.000071,Meg,"unfortunately, that one doesn't support remote debugging"
682,2017-08-30T08:12:24.000409,Shirl,"but if it’ll make a lot easier for me to debug with pycharm, i can try to get that instead"
682,2017-08-30T08:12:25.000256,Meg,and doesn't seem like other packages will allow you to do so
682,2017-08-30T08:12:41.000111,Meg,"there's a community version that's free, and should fit your needs here"
682,2017-08-30T08:13:02.000219,Meg,"but its a more full-featured environment than atom, with a learning curve."
682,2017-08-30T08:13:16.000096,Meg,"not to dissuade you, but as a heads up"
682,2017-08-30T08:13:27.000152,Ciera,isn't the remote debugger only in the paid version ?
682,2017-08-30T08:13:51.000236,Meg,"not sure, lemme check"
682,2017-08-30T08:13:55.000018,Ciera,I think sshing to the rpi and using logging/print could do the trick
682,2017-08-30T08:14:13.000317,Ciera,or use the rpi ide
682,2017-08-30T08:14:36.000113,Beula,"+1, or run with `pdb` via ssh"
682,2017-08-30T08:14:46.000121,Shirl,"yeah, rpi is headless right now"
682,2017-08-30T08:14:48.000312,Beula,Just add `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` at the beginning of your function
682,2017-08-30T08:14:50.000355,Meg,"<@Shirl> <@Ciera>, pycharm remote debugging is only in the paid version"

682,2017-08-30T08:15:00.000355,Shirl,oh

688,2017-08-30T15:53:27.000465,Patty,"```
Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds a lambda expression directly to an identifier.

Yes:

def f(x): return 2*x
No:

f = lambda x: 2*x
The first form means that the name of the resulting function object is specifically 'f' instead of the generic '&lt;lambda&gt;'. This is more useful for tracebacks and string representations in general. The use of the assignment statement eliminates the sole benefit a lambda expression can offer over an explicit def statement (i.e. that it can be embedded inside a larger expression)```"

What are the pitfalls of doing `list(some_map_object)` when you really want `[x for x in some_map_object]`?"

What I need is to assign it to a variable  language_code = re.match( '[^/]\w{1}' ) However, this doesn't work because I don't want to provide a string to match to as an argument. I just want to get the two letters from the string."
692,2017-08-31T11:12:15.000054,Meghan,"I'm not sure I'm understanding what you are saying, can you show that part of your code?"
692,2017-08-31T11:12:32.000231,Meghan,Why would you not provide the string as an argument?
692,2017-08-31T11:13:08.000463,Meghan,"Also, regex could be the wrong way for this. Regex really should be used when other string manipulation can't do what you want easily."

692,2017-08-31T11:20:35.000139,Suellen,"<@Jeanette> but, if you're not providing a second argument, what are you matching your regex against?"
692,2017-08-31T11:20:59.000246,Meghan,"The second argument is the string, you have to provide that."
692,2017-08-31T11:30:15.000346,Jeanette,only the first two letters between the slashes
692,2017-08-31T11:30:55.000171,Meghan,"Is the url format always the same? If so, just split on slashes."
692,2017-08-31T11:31:54.000251,Meghan,```language = url.split('/')[1]```
692,2017-08-31T11:32:00.000238,Jeanette,the urls always starts with the language code e.g: /en/blog/first-post/
692,2017-08-31T11:34:06.000730,Meghan,"That is splitting on slashes, which returns a list of strings, and taking the 1 index. You'll want to do this for the other pieces too most likely."
692,2017-08-31T11:38:22.000059,Jeanette,I will try it thank you!
692,2017-08-31T11:38:26.000060,Meghan,You're welcome.
692,2017-08-31T11:39:00.000259,Meghan,"If you are taking parameters after that, such as a sort order, or number of items to show, you'll probably want to convert it to a dictionary for those, that too should be easy."

695,2017-08-31T14:01:20.000120,Suellen,<@Tameika> where does it stop behaving in a predictable manner?
695,2017-08-31T14:03:38.000167,Tameika,"<@Suellen> : i think the problem is this line :  ` new_rows = delegate(someLib.process(req), req.image_path, image_url)`"
695,2017-08-31T14:04:21.000657,Tameika,"when I comment that line, the whole program runs fine"
695,2017-08-31T14:05:27.000471,Suellen,"so, relevant code is probably there"
695,2017-08-31T14:08:14.000679,Tameika,"true, i think it has got do with the fact that the `someLib.process(req)` is being called by multiple workers"
695,2017-08-31T14:08:25.000210,Suellen,what is that library?
695,2017-08-31T14:08:50.000573,Suellen,"hm.. even if it's not thread-safe, does that mean it's not multiprocess-safe?"
695,2017-08-31T14:09:00.000086,Suellen,I'm honestly not sure
695,2017-08-31T14:09:58.000451,Tameika,it is a library which I created myself to wrap C++ code. Didnt take it account thread safety
695,2017-08-31T14:10:43.000300,Suellen,"in theory it should be ok, since a whole process is launched for the task"
695,2017-08-31T14:11:20.000057,Suellen,"a debugger of some kind is your best bet, guessing will only take you so far"
695,2017-08-31T14:11:40.000068,Suellen,"One guess left:
&gt; req = someLib.Request()"
695,2017-08-31T14:11:50.000367,Suellen,This is a shared resource that's used between processes
695,2017-08-31T14:12:03.000786,Suellen,that's not very good
695,2017-08-31T14:12:15.000189,Suellen,can you refactor it so that each worker gets its own copy?
695,2017-08-31T14:13:32.000139,Tameika,sure will do
695,2017-08-31T14:21:56.000327,Tameika,it still waits
695,2017-08-31T14:22:22.000594,Tameika,essentially it prints all the 'before' statements and hangs
695,2017-08-31T14:24:10.000141,Suellen,inside `delegate` too?
695,2017-08-31T14:24:18.000350,Suellen,up until you call a C function?
695,2017-08-31T14:25:07.000320,Tameika,"delegate does not call the C function , it is `someLib.process(req)` which does"
695,2017-08-31T14:25:51.000064,Tameika,i even decoupled that line into 2 lines : ```c_resp = someLib.process(req)
695,2017-08-31T14:27:15.000177,Suellen,you most definitely need a real debugger then

697,2017-08-31T16:39:37.000302,Suellen,probably not :disappointed:
697,2017-08-31T16:39:52.000392,Suellen,but it's saved in your current session
697,2017-08-31T17:20:49.000311,Bruno,"hmm. more efficient way to write this if theres a million `accounts` and you just need to return the first:
```
account = [acc for acc in portfolio if 'type' in acc and acc['type'] == 'annuity'][0]
```
while keeping it in a generator. easy if just using a loop"
697,2017-08-31T17:30:55.000341,Antionette,<@Bruno> can you do `account = next(acc for acc in portfolio if 'type' in acc and acc['type'] == 'annuity')`
697,2017-08-31T17:39:28.000106,Bruno,"<@Antionette> hmm, ill have to try that."
697,2017-08-31T17:40:40.000002,Antionette,<@Bruno> afaik it should only run until first is found
697,2017-08-31T17:45:12.000186,Bruno,no but if it doesnt exist it will throw an exception.
697,2017-08-31T17:45:38.000261,Bruno,which is fine.
697,2017-08-31T17:52:01.000050,Antionette,"<@Bruno> I believe it could also take in a default argument like: `account = next((acc for acc in portfolio if 'type' in acc and acc['type'] == 'annuity'), false)` if you wanted to do it like that.  I think your original example would have also thrown an error if it was not found (list index out of range)"
698,2017-08-31T17:36:39.000232,Tameika,What is the most effective way to perform `Open Image in new tab` and grab the url of that image in python?

698,2017-08-31T17:37:54.000050,Tameika,but it does seem to retrieve all images
698,2017-08-31T17:40:31.000321,Suellen,don't forget about iter!
698,2017-08-31T17:40:43.000102,Suellen,doesn't exhaust the generator!
698,2017-08-31T17:45:29.000352,Bruno,so need try/catch
698,2017-08-31T17:53:25.000481,Antionette,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next>
698,2017-08-31T17:55:32.000090,Bruno,"hmm, interesting."
698,2017-08-31T17:56:10.000161,Bruno,the original shouldnt and just not return any results.
698,2017-08-31T18:22:37.000205,Antionette,the comprehension part would return an empty list and then trying to get the first element would raise the exception
698,2017-08-31T19:01:40.000093,Bruno,<@Antionette> ooh. youre right.

702,2017-09-01T04:09:34.000095,Ciera,I believe it's best to `.gitignore` the `.pyc` files
702,2017-09-01T04:10:34.000147,Beverley,i did but they were added to the log before I added *.pyc to gitignore actually just did a commit without adding the files and it worked
702,2017-09-01T04:12:11.000198,Ciera,you might also want to do a commit that delete the one on master
703,2017-09-01T05:15:21.000001,Lanita,"I have a list `seq`. I want to split this list up into sublists by grouping them around a function. Any idea what this might be called?

703,2017-09-01T05:16:25.000125,Suellen,groupby?
703,2017-09-01T05:16:46.000242,Lanita,oh... of course. I kept looking at things called partition. thanks.
703,2017-09-01T05:19:40.000055,Suellen,you might want to look at `more-itertools` or `boltons` library
703,2017-09-01T05:19:50.000024,Suellen,lots of short helper functions there
703,2017-09-01T05:20:46.000179,Suellen,<https://github.com/mahmoud/boltons/blob/master/boltons/iterutils.py#L470>
703,2017-09-01T05:20:53.000008,Suellen,"```
    &gt;&gt;&gt; bucketize(range(10), lambda x: x % 3)
    {0: [0, 3, 6, 9], 1: [1, 4, 7], 2: [2, 5, 8]}
```"
703,2017-09-01T05:20:56.000041,Suellen,just look at the example!
703,2017-09-01T05:21:00.000040,Suellen,cool
703,2017-09-01T05:22:57.000209,Denna,hello guys
703,2017-09-01T05:23:02.000135,Denna,i have a question
703,2017-09-01T05:23:28.000182,Denna,"i have a user data with 20 different parameters and i have some ""results"" with predefined conditions"
703,2017-09-01T05:24:05.000038,Denna,"like ""((a=5 or b=3) and user.is_active) or user.is_admin"""
703,2017-09-01T05:25:32.000362,Denna,"i can run eval(condition) for each result on each data but there are plenty of result items now, like 2000, it takes too long"
703,2017-09-01T05:27:55.000084,Lanita,"Perhaps there's a nicer way to solve my problem though: I want to grab the first value in each group created by splitting a sequence up using some function.
Right now I'm thinking of doing something like
```
    for k, group in groupby(sorted(seq), partitionfunc):
        yield next(group)
        continue
```"
703,2017-09-01T05:27:56.000224,Denna,any advices to make it faster and more clean-logical-pythonic?
703,2017-09-01T05:30:30.000296,Suellen,<@Lanita> `next(groupby(...))`?
703,2017-09-01T05:30:51.000036,Ciera,<@Denna> those predifined conditions are string ?
703,2017-09-01T05:30:51.000075,Gabriele,<@Denna> I think that depends largely on the semantics of those conditions. `eval` is almost certainly not the answer though
703,2017-09-01T05:31:21.000079,Denna,<@Ciera> they are coming from users of the system
703,2017-09-01T05:31:31.000242,Denna,not from a programmer
703,2017-09-01T05:31:36.000197,Ciera,also please use <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks> :slightly_smiling_face:
703,2017-09-01T05:31:57.000084,Ciera,you might want to look at testing framework that does thing like this
703,2017-09-01T05:32:07.000242,Ciera,but I don't remember how it's called :confused:
703,2017-09-01T05:32:50.000159,Gabriele,How are users able to formulate these conditions when they obviously refer to code details (like the existence of an 'is_admin' property)
703,2017-09-01T05:34:30.000141,Lanita,"Perhaps this explains it better:

```
from typing import Sequence, TypeVar, Callable, Any, Generator
from itertools import groupby
    
T = TypeVar(""T"")
def first_of_each_group(seq: Sequence[T], group_by: Callable[[T], Any])\
        -&gt; Generator:
    """"""Groups every object x in `seq` by the value from `group_by(x)`,
    then returns the first entry of every group.
    """"""
    for _, group in groupby(sorted(seq), group_by):
        yield next(group)
        continue
    
from unittest import TestCase
class FuncTest(TestCase):
    def test_first_of_each_group(self):
        input_data = [3, 1, 349, 12, 4, 939, 16]
        group_by = lambda x: len(str(x))
        expected_outut = [1, 349, 12]
        
        self.assertCountEqual(
            list(first_of_each_group(input_data, group_by)),
            expected_output)
```"
703,2017-09-01T05:34:57.000013,Denna,we're giving a simple doc about available variables to them
703,2017-09-01T05:35:08.000302,Denna,"in practice, there is no ""user.is_admin"" for them"
703,2017-09-01T05:35:35.000362,Denna,"i mean, the real input is, ""is_admin"", and i change it with ""self.request.user.is_admin"" like thing"
703,2017-09-01T05:36:07.000107,Gabriele,If you truly do have an arbitrary list of completely unrelated conditions then I fear that there is very little that can be done to improve your situation
703,2017-09-01T05:36:24.000100,Denna,fair enough
703,2017-09-01T05:36:36.000042,Denna,thanks btw
703,2017-09-01T05:37:04.000259,Gabriele,If you can simplify the conditions in some way - e.g. to make them all into conjunctions (everything must be true) - then you can make it more data-driven
703,2017-09-01T05:37:15.000372,Lanita,"hm, in this case we're sorting `seq` first so we're not getting the first value of `seq` as much as ""exactly one value from seq"", but it doesn't matter for me at the moment"
703,2017-09-01T05:37:51.000221,Suellen,I'm really not sure how to change it right now
704,2017-09-01T10:28:34.000720,Pura,"Hello everyone, i have a question about class initialization

so i have a class that i am importing into a main .py file. Lets call it imp_mod.

i have the init defined so that when i call imp_mod.ClassName() it runs the init. but it also seems to be running the rest of the methods inside of the class. Why would it be doing that?"
704,2017-09-01T10:30:17.000432,Meg,"so you have something like 

```
class ImpMod:
    def __init__(self):
        # some code here
```"
704,2017-09-01T10:30:43.000024,Meg,and you’re calling it via `imp_mode.ImpMod()`?
704,2017-09-01T10:31:15.000627,Pura,yes
704,2017-09-01T10:33:38.000248,Meg,what do you have defined in the `__init__`?
704,2017-09-01T10:37:45.000332,Pura,underneath that i have a function that runs the self.desktop_driver called def search(self) and it runs a loop. When i call imp_mod.ImpBot() it seems like it is running that search function that isnt being called in init
704,2017-09-01T10:39:55.000078,Gabriele,"You don't seem _sure_ though. Have you tried putting a print statement in that search function to confirm, one way or the other?"
704,2017-09-01T10:40:44.000222,Pura,"i just did as a sanity check, and my print statement inside search does appear"
704,2017-09-01T10:41:43.000060,Pura,might it be because in the main function i am assigning it to a variable?
704,2017-09-01T10:41:51.000073,Meg,would you mind adding the entire `ImpBot class`?
704,2017-09-01T10:41:52.000197,Gabriele,You'll have to show the code
704,2017-09-01T10:42:00.000014,Pura,bot = imp_mod.ImpBot()
704,2017-09-01T10:42:00.000649,Pura,sure
704,2017-09-01T10:43:43.000364,Meg,"does it also happen when you do

```
from imp_mod import ImpBot
bot = ImpBot()
```"
704,2017-09-01T10:44:45.000587,Pura,ill see
704,2017-09-01T10:45:28.000224,Pura,yes it still does it
704,2017-09-01T10:45:57.000204,Meg,what is `search_terms`
704,2017-09-01T10:46:01.000753,Meg,and where are you declaring it
704,2017-09-01T10:46:39.000394,Pura,search terms is an array of strings that lives outside of the class but in the same file
704,2017-09-01T10:46:58.000294,Gabriele,Most likely it's the stuff outside the class that is causing this problem
704,2017-09-01T10:47:03.000571,Pura,ok
704,2017-09-01T10:47:15.000784,Gabriele,perhaps something is making an instance and calling .search()?
704,2017-09-01T10:47:37.000663,Pura,so...i have a tkinter button
704,2017-09-01T10:47:45.000083,Pura,ill put that file in
704,2017-09-01T10:47:46.000345,Pura,h/o
704,2017-09-01T10:48:05.000307,Pura,the command arg is set to call the search
704,2017-09-01T10:48:29.000438,Pura,"so that may be it, but idk why it is running it before the Tkinter menu even appears"
704,2017-09-01T10:48:54.000478,Gabriele,perhaps it's set up wrong. sometimes people put in the `()` in the UI code when they shouldn't
704,2017-09-01T10:49:52.000210,Pura,ohhhh
704,2017-09-01T10:49:57.000077,Pura,so im doing .search()
704,2017-09-01T10:50:00.000498,Gabriele,exactly
704,2017-09-01T10:50:02.000695,Pura,when it should just be .search
704,2017-09-01T10:50:06.000379,Pura,ohhhhhh
704,2017-09-01T10:50:32.000157,Pura,WORKS
704,2017-09-01T10:50:40.000403,Pura,"thank you, i didnt know that that would make a difference"
704,2017-09-01T10:50:46.000390,Gabriele,glad we could help
704,2017-09-01T10:51:31.000321,Pura,<@Gabriele> <@Meg> :+1:
704,2017-09-01T10:51:50.000305,Pura,so that is a general python rule then? that if it has the () at the end it will run it regardless?
704,2017-09-01T10:52:02.000647,Meg,"depends, really"
704,2017-09-01T10:52:26.000625,Meg,is it being passed as an argument to a method that is expecting a function or method?
704,2017-09-01T10:52:36.000224,Meg,or is it to be executed at that point?
704,2017-09-01T10:52:49.000430,Gabriele,the `()` means 'call this function immediately'
704,2017-09-01T10:53:02.000621,Gabriele,so you're assigning the result of that function call to `command`
704,2017-09-01T10:53:11.000266,Pura,ahhhh
704,2017-09-01T10:53:13.000103,Gabriele,when you really want to assign the _function itself_ to `command`
704,2017-09-01T10:53:27.000108,Pura,"right, makes sense to me"
704,2017-09-01T10:53:50.000075,Pura,"it shouldnt be called instantly, since it is a button and should only be called when pressed"
704,2017-09-01T10:53:55.000108,Pura,so no ()
704,2017-09-01T10:53:58.000730,Pura,got it!
704,2017-09-01T10:55:42.000203,Meg,"however, there are places where you do need the function to be called right away"
704,2017-09-01T10:55:55.000121,Meg,"for example, django url definitions with class based views"
704,2017-09-01T10:56:16.000087,Meg,"you have to use the `.as_view()` call when mapping a view class to a URL, or it won’t work"
704,2017-09-01T10:56:46.000056,Gabriele,"yeah, sometimes you have to call a function which returns the function you want to assign. functions returning functions. :slightly_smiling_face:"
704,2017-09-01T10:56:57.000106,Meg,functionception

711,2017-09-02T06:09:52.000071,Ciera,we use it for all our API. Without any ORM pure sql
711,2017-09-02T06:22:18.000024,Adalberto,"OK, and just a very basic async question: what happens if I try to use a blocking ORM like Sqlalchemy ORM in an async app? As normal db requests are so fast, would it be a problem that it blocks?"
711,2017-09-02T06:29:32.000060,Suellen,"wait, what parts of ORM are inherently blocking?"
711,2017-09-02T06:29:46.000013,Suellen,I thought ORM was an abstraction over Core which by itself does nothing
711,2017-09-02T06:29:56.000002,Suellen,Or it's just too complex to sort out at once?
711,2017-09-02T06:30:12.000041,Ciera,no idea
711,2017-09-02T06:30:27.000035,Gabriele,"Well, if you call a function that returns some objects, that function doesn't return until the objects are available, so that counts as blocking in some sense"
711,2017-09-02T06:30:56.000018,Ciera,I think people are trying to focus on core first as it's the most important part
711,2017-09-02T06:31:11.000037,Suellen,"true that, even Core is fantastic"
711,2017-09-02T06:36:47.000069,Adalberto,I think Core is now async and only ORM is the problem. Also there is a great article by Mike: <http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/>
711,2017-09-02T06:37:38.000038,Suellen,"great article, in which he says he doesn't care about async and nobody should :confused:"
711,2017-09-02T06:38:51.000051,Adalberto,"<@Suellen> yes, it's a bit strange that he says that. But he also recommends gevent to solve the same problems, and some long time Python users told me that using gevent is insane in production."
711,2017-09-02T06:39:23.000040,Gabriele,It's pretty clear from the Core docs that it's not intrinsically an async API
711,2017-09-02T06:39:41.000044,Suellen,"gevent isn't really insane, it has a looong history and is stable"
711,2017-09-02T06:39:45.000056,Adalberto,This reply: <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/pylons-discuss/hI9zY4JYBU4/yNGGbE-IAgAJ>
711,2017-09-02T06:39:53.000001,Suellen,but it IS a very non-native approach
711,2017-09-02T06:42:38.000054,Suellen,funny that he says it's inappropriate to use async with databases
711,2017-09-02T06:42:48.000067,Suellen,when threads are just async functions from the POV of the OS
711,2017-09-02T06:43:16.000041,Ciera,fyi this might be more a topic for <#C07G5276F|async> :slightly_smiling_face:
711,2017-09-02T06:43:50.000009,Suellen,sorry mr admin
711,2017-09-02T06:59:13.000021,Ciera,haha well it's also that I'm sure some people in <#C07G5276F|async> might have good arguments on this topic and not sure they are all in here
712,2017-09-02T06:05:20.000046,Adalberto,"Hi, does anyone have any experience in using aiohttp 2.0+ vs. sanic as a HTTP server?"

712,2017-09-02T06:09:08.000035,Adalberto,<@Ciera> do you use it for a full webserver or only for slower endpoints? Are you using it with an ORM?
712,2017-09-02T06:28:07.000044,Ciera,Well it's best to use a non blocking one obviously. There is some work on making sqlalchemy work with asyncio
712,2017-09-02T06:28:24.000057,Ciera,for example this <https://github.com/CanopyTax/asyncpgsa> by <@Signe> but it's only for sqlalchemy core
713,2017-09-02T09:55:22.000003,Johana,anyone have a full proof method installing ffmpeg and opencv on a mac using make or brew combination that actually works?
714,2017-09-02T10:08:41.000006,Junita,"hmm, what’s the error you are getting?"
714,2017-09-02T10:09:29.000001,Suellen,(what about docker though?)
714,2017-09-02T10:09:44.000015,Junita,yeah that was my first thought too.  :slightly_smiling_face:
714,2017-09-02T12:04:29.000003,Beverley,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46015606/pil-set-pixel-as-transparent-blank>
714,2017-09-02T12:05:48.000101,Suellen,Does `print(img.mode)` show ARGB?
714,2017-09-02T12:06:37.000017,Beverley,it's rgb
714,2017-09-02T12:07:25.000064,Suellen,`img = img.convert('ARGB')`
714,2017-09-02T12:07:36.000055,Suellen,otherwise there is no transparency channel
714,2017-09-02T12:09:50.000018,Beverley,"is this before or after saving, note I have two saves; one for creating the file the other for editing to transparent"
714,2017-09-02T12:10:03.000087,Suellen,what do you mean?
714,2017-09-02T12:10:22.000001,Suellen,you can't set a transparent pixel on an image that doesn't have a transparency (alpha) channel
714,2017-09-02T12:10:58.000045,Suellen,you need to convert from RBG to ARBG before you put a tranparent pixel there
714,2017-09-02T12:11:29.000024,Suellen,"and obviously when you save, you should use a format that supports alpha channels. For example png."
714,2017-09-02T12:11:48.000007,Beverley,ValueError: conversion from RGB to ARGB not supported
714,2017-09-02T12:11:58.000135,Beverley,"img.convert('ARGB')
		img.save(random_name, ""PNG"")"
714,2017-09-02T12:12:36.000065,Suellen,try RGBA
714,2017-09-02T12:12:46.000094,Suellen,I forgot a proper name :slightly_smiling_face:
714,2017-09-02T12:21:41.000011,Suellen,`img.convert('RGBA')` -- the image gets converted to RGBA and you throw the result away
714,2017-09-02T12:21:50.000080,Suellen,`img = img.convert('RGBA')`
714,2017-09-02T12:24:21.000045,Beverley,yes that was it works :slightly_smiling_face:
714,2017-09-02T18:12:14.000001,Suellen,<@Sidney> <https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#module-http.server>
714,2017-09-02T18:12:28.000003,Suellen,you can spin up a simple http server using only stdlib
714,2017-09-02T18:13:47.000064,Suellen,are you sure you even need to accept a request at all?
714,2017-09-02T18:14:46.000062,Sidney,"AFAIK, yes, the result of the authorization comes to me as a HTTP request to the callback URL."
714,2017-09-02T18:15:48.000014,Sidney,There's a chance I misunderstand how OAuth 1.0 works.
714,2017-09-02T18:16:09.000026,Suellen,"I only ask because, for example, you can auth on Reddit using OAuth without a redirect or a callback"
714,2017-09-02T18:16:27.000011,Sidney,Is it OAuth 1.0 or 2.0?
714,2017-09-02T18:16:45.000021,Suellen,2.0
714,2017-09-02T18:16:54.000022,Sidney,That might be one of the differences.
714,2017-09-02T18:17:26.000015,Sidney,"Or more likely, I'm completely misunderstanding how this works."
714,2017-09-02T18:28:11.000039,Sidney,<@Suellen> Thanks for the link. Keeping everything in python and in the same codebase will definitely make this easier to manage. I'll look into that library further.
714,2017-09-02T19:47:55.000034,Gabriele,"<@Sidney> There are often 2 different authentication flows available - one for clients, and one for servers. Make sure you're using the right one for your situation"
714,2017-09-02T21:17:03.000015,Sidney,"<@Gabriele> I don't follow. From what I understand all authentication flows require a client **and** a server, each playing a different role in the exchange."
715,2017-09-02T18:03:24.000007,Sidney,"I am writing a Python program part of which authenticates with OAuth 1.0 to access a privileged API. I have figured out how to get the authorization URL. After signing in, the browser redirects to <http://localhost> which I registered as the callback with the provider. How do I get the request to localhost and continue with my bot? I figure I need to have a http server of some sort. I would rather not install a full Apache server. What is a lightweight alternative that can receive the request and forward the token to my bot code to continue with API calls?"
716,2017-09-02T22:00:48.000050,Taryn,"I'm in the middle of writing a simple process priority script, and I'm running into ""access is denied"" even in an admin cmd window for processes that are ran by System. Would anyone be able to access me?"
716,2017-09-02T22:01:46.000024,Taryn,assist rather
716,2017-09-03T01:18:59.000006,Galen,I need a little help with Django... please ping me
717,2017-09-03T02:57:08.000032,Clarine,anybody in here use jetbrains products?
717,2017-09-03T03:35:34.000012,Eliza,<@Clarine>
717,2017-09-03T06:52:43.000054,Suellen,right
717,2017-09-03T06:55:36.000015,Galen,<@Suellen> thanks for the lead brother :)
718,2017-09-03T03:35:24.000032,Eliza,yes
719,2017-09-03T05:45:18.000054,Augusta,can anybody help me with Interpretabiliy models in Deep Learning??
719,2017-09-03T06:32:27.000052,Ramona,What's up with people not just posting their problems? :grimacing: how is anyone supposed to help that way 
719,2017-09-03T06:53:32.000034,Suellen,"<@Galen> post in <#C0LMFRMB5|django>, they are much more likely to help"
719,2017-09-03T06:54:03.000046,Suellen,<@Augusta> also we have a <#C2J4B66PK|machine_learning> channel where you can post your problem
720,2017-09-03T09:18:16.000061,Monty,"does anybody use PyCharm? When I switch tabs, I want   Run/Debug in the upper right corner to change automatically. Now I have to manually select the file which I want to Run/Debug everytime I switch a tab."
720,2017-09-03T09:19:30.000052,Meg,it won’t
720,2017-09-03T09:19:54.000016,Meg,pycharm usually has the last run execution as the top option in the dropdown
720,2017-09-03T09:20:17.000012,Meg,but you can right click in the file after changing the tab and select Run or Debug
720,2017-09-03T09:22:06.000026,Meg,"if that’s something that you would find handy to have, you can submit a feature request at <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/PY>"
720,2017-09-03T09:25:59.000024,Meg,"but a major problem for that is most run configurations are project based, not file based"
720,2017-09-03T09:27:02.000008,Monty,"yes, but don't you agree that it is silly for PyCharm, which is one of the best Python IDE's, to not have that option?"
720,2017-09-03T09:27:23.000081,Meg,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
720,2017-09-03T09:27:30.000050,Meg,make a feature request
720,2017-09-03T09:27:46.000044,Monty,How many times have I ran the wrong file :slightly_smiling_face:
720,2017-09-03T09:27:55.000083,Meg,right click -&gt; run
720,2017-09-03T09:28:07.000052,Meg,and then the list will be re-ordered
720,2017-09-03T09:29:13.000043,Monty,"yeah, I know, I'am using that option...I will submit a request"
720,2017-09-03T09:29:19.000057,Meg,"for me, it would be an absolutely useless feature"
720,2017-09-03T09:29:26.000059,Meg,"because I’m project-based, not file based"
720,2017-09-03T09:29:31.000060,Monty,why is that?
720,2017-09-03T09:29:44.000006,Meg,"so, if I keep changing files and tabs in a project, I don’t want to run the current file"
720,2017-09-03T09:29:52.000041,Meg,I want to run the entire project
720,2017-09-03T09:30:56.000020,Meg,"so if I have a django or flask project going on, and I edit the models file.  I don’t want the run configuration to automatically switch to running that file, vs the project run configuration I already have active"
720,2017-09-03T09:31:26.000024,Monty,"ohh...I am a absolute beginner, so I find that lack of option strange and unintuitive"
720,2017-09-03T09:32:45.000004,Meg,"ah, ok.  for you, it might make more sense to have that kind of option.  But I would suspect that for the vast majority of pycharm users, that would result in unintended side effects like how I described above"
720,2017-09-03T09:33:00.000014,Meg,"also, consider the fact that each file might have different interpreter and run arguments"
720,2017-09-03T09:33:15.000073,Meg,so that would require you to create a run configuration for each file
720,2017-09-03T09:34:05.000043,Meg,"if you switch over to a file that has no configuration set up, how would it behave?"
720,2017-09-03T09:35:14.000028,Monty,different interpreter? Why would someone want to change the interpreter?
720,2017-09-03T09:35:25.000006,Meg,one file runs on 3.5
720,2017-09-03T09:35:29.000063,Meg,other runs on 3.6.2
720,2017-09-03T09:35:47.000028,Meg,or you need to pass in a different argument to the interpreter
720,2017-09-03T09:36:00.000035,Monty,backward compatible?
720,2017-09-03T09:37:11.000025,Meg,"so, what pycharm lets you do is define interpreter configurations, where you can define interpeter executable paths or virtualenvs"
720,2017-09-03T09:37:16.000060,Meg,and then apply in run config
720,2017-09-03T09:37:46.000034,Meg,"so, for one project, if you need it to be backwards compatible, you can have a run config pointing to your 3.6 environment"
720,2017-09-03T09:37:54.000058,Meg,named `project 3.6`
720,2017-09-03T09:38:02.000056,Meg,and another `project 3.5`
720,2017-09-03T09:38:44.000055,Meg,"now, if you’re flipping from file to file intending to run it against a specific interpreter version, re-ordering the run configuration options will mess you up"
720,2017-09-03T09:38:54.000044,Meg,and introduce a non-intuitive UI
720,2017-09-03T09:39:03.000031,Meg,"so, from a UI experience, think about this"
720,2017-09-03T09:39:50.000033,Meg,"how much extra complexity will implementing your workflow introduce into the UI, and how to handle the edge cases?"
720,2017-09-03T09:40:43.000049,Meg,compared to how many users this is actually targeted for?
720,2017-09-03T09:41:23.000028,Monty,"I cannot fully understand you, but wouldn't it be logical when the file changes, interpreter for that specific file changes too?"
720,2017-09-03T09:42:36.000087,Monty,"In other words, when you change the file, Run configuration for that file changes too"
720,2017-09-03T09:42:37.000001,Meg,no
720,2017-09-03T09:43:00.000004,Meg,because pycharm is intended to be project based run configuration
720,2017-09-03T09:43:03.000013,Meg,not file based
720,2017-09-03T09:45:56.000022,Monty,"ok, I will get that later maybe, when I run into such problems :slightly_smiling_face: Do you have a time to help me with some code. I am building a simple calculator, about 25 lines of code"
720,2017-09-03T09:46:20.000078,Meg,ask here.  I suspect I’m not the only one around here now :slightly_smiling_face:
720,2017-09-03T09:46:35.000030,Monty,"I have made it, but I want to make it more efficient...."
720,2017-09-03T09:48:33.000066,Monty,"ok, the question is...how do I print dictionary value, if some variable is the same as dictionary key?"
720,2017-09-03T09:49:50.000038,Monty,"when that variable is found in dictionary, and it matches the dictionary key, I want the program to print the dictionary value that is associated with that key that matches that variable"
720,2017-09-03T09:51:53.000058,Meg,"you mean something like a dict `{'a'=0, 'b'=1, 'c'=3}` and  a variable `lookup_key = 'a'`?"
720,2017-09-03T09:53:03.000069,Monty,give me a few minutes to translate the code in english
720,2017-09-03T09:54:28.000010,Meg,no problem.  What’s your native language?
720,2017-09-03T09:57:38.000037,Monty,Serbian
720,2017-09-03T10:03:04.000020,Monty,"```while True:
    print(
        ""Welcome to our shitttttty calculator. First, choose two numbers, the choose the operation."")

    first_number = float(input(""Enter the first number: ""))
    second_number = float(input(""Enter the second number: ""))

    dictionary1 = {""addition"": first_number + second_number, ""substraction"": first_number - second_number,
              ""multiplication"": first_number * second_number, ""division"": first_number / second_number }

    user_input= str(input(""Choose your operation: ""))

    if user_input in dictionary1:
        print(dictionary1.items())
        break```"
720,2017-09-03T10:08:57.000053,Meg,"so, its `user_input` you’re looking for?"
720,2017-09-03T10:10:37.000011,Monty,yes
720,2017-09-03T10:10:41.000079,Monty,I want to...
720,2017-09-03T10:12:36.000030,Monty,"when user_input matches a key in dictionary1 (when their values are matched) , then to print the value of that matched key"
720,2017-09-03T10:12:50.000054,Monty,I don't know how to target that
720,2017-09-03T10:13:03.000048,Meg,"so, `dict` has a few methods on it that you would find useful here.  first, `items()` returns a tuple of `key, value`.  Also, `key()` returns a list of the keys, and `values()` does the same for values"
720,2017-09-03T10:13:38.000003,Meg,"so, here, you would want to leverage `keys()` for your `if user_input` conditional"
720,2017-09-03T10:14:06.000084,Meg,"for example, with your dict above, `addition in dictionary1.keys()` returns `True`"
720,2017-09-03T10:14:09.000032,Monty,"yes, I googled that a little, and I know that it returns the whole list of values and keys, but I want that one specific value from dictionary, not all of them..."
720,2017-09-03T10:14:35.000066,Meg,alright
720,2017-09-03T10:14:51.000006,Meg,"so, if you have `if user_input in dictionary1.keys()`:"
720,2017-09-03T10:14:57.000027,Meg,and `addition` is user_input
720,2017-09-03T10:16:46.000032,Meg,"so, you know `addition` is a key in the dict"
720,2017-09-03T10:16:54.000005,Meg,how do you access keys with a dict?
720,2017-09-03T10:17:10.000021,Meg,`dictionary1[user_input]`
720,2017-09-03T10:17:38.000076,Nita,"hey all, if anyone has any experience with selenium I've got a quick question I just posted in learning_python"
720,2017-09-03T10:19:16.000029,Monty,thanks...I did not know that I can target values outside of dictionary...
720,2017-09-03T10:19:38.000084,Meg,"oh, yes."
720,2017-09-03T10:20:00.000074,Meg,"but remember, in order to get a value from a dict, you either have to know the key beforehand"
720,2017-09-03T10:20:12.000032,Meg,"eg, `dictionary`[‘addition’]`"
720,2017-09-03T10:20:22.000016,Meg,or loop through it and doing some comparison
720,2017-09-03T10:20:45.000040,Monty,aha...makes sense...
720,2017-09-03T10:23:25.000012,Meg,"if you want to simplify things, you can use list comprehensions

`[value for key, value in dictionary1.items() if key == user_input]`"
720,2017-09-03T10:23:33.000075,Meg,which returns a list of matches
720,2017-09-03T10:24:28.000049,Monty,"I came from more then a  year discrete math course, and I thought the transition would be much more easier. The most difficult thing in programming so far has been the understanding how the language actually works, quirks, what am I allowed and not allowed to do..."
720,2017-09-03T10:25:51.000034,Meg,yup
720,2017-09-03T10:26:07.000001,Meg,"there are two major difficulties, I feel"
720,2017-09-03T10:26:16.000078,Meg,one: describe what you want to do in discrete steps
720,2017-09-03T10:26:54.000040,Meg,"two, use the language syntax and tools to replicate the project steps"
720,2017-09-03T10:27:23.000091,Meg,"first language, you typically struggle with both at the same time, because you need to get the syntax and how to use it to do what you want"
720,2017-09-03T10:27:35.000037,Meg,"but after that, its easier to pick up another one"
720,2017-09-03T10:27:42.000062,Monty,"yes, exactly, number two is a bigger problem now :slightly_smiling_face:"
720,2017-09-03T10:27:43.000033,Meg,"like for me, I originally started in java"
720,2017-09-03T10:28:15.000046,Meg,and there were lots of times where I felt I was paying the university for nothing more than to feel like an idiot
720,2017-09-03T10:31:55.000035,Meg,java and python have alot of good things
720,2017-09-03T10:32:06.000014,Meg,I’m equally comfortable wokrking in both
720,2017-09-03T10:32:20.000040,Meg,"but then, I’m a full stack dev in both languages"
720,2017-09-03T10:32:52.000077,Meg,everything from server configuration all the way to css styling for a web application
720,2017-09-03T10:38:57.000016,Collette,"java seems okay to me, but java developers often overcomplicate things"
720,2017-09-03T10:39:41.000001,Monty,"Do you have Skype, email, facebook, or some other tools of communication where  I can ask you something when I get really stuck? :slightly_smiling_face:"
720,2017-09-03T10:41:59.000038,Collette,"like when they have a single class (a custom service sdk) with a bunch of methods to test, they're likely to
a) create the sdk interface (even if it's obvious there won't be an other implementation)
b) create the abstract base class implementing the interface (even there won't be more than one subclass, ever)

720,2017-09-03T10:43:04.000032,Meg,"just ask here, to be honest"
720,2017-09-03T10:43:34.000038,Collette,"Oh, if only in the spring framework. Much likely in an in-house, custom framework which won't have many nice integrations and features spring provides"
720,2017-09-03T10:43:51.000091,Meg,"because I’m not really a mentor, nor do I have the time to be.  Also, being part of the community here means you get to ask questions and then as you get better, contribute back"
720,2017-09-03T10:44:41.000065,Monty,"sure, I understand"
720,2017-09-03T10:44:55.000083,Meg,"I’ve only worked on two large java projects.  one was in spring, other was in google web toolkit with a custom in-house library"
720,2017-09-03T10:46:12.000029,Meg,"and honestly, the in-house library was about 100KLOC of some of the best code I’ve ever read.  Sure, there were some warts in it that I was glad I didn’t have to implement, but overall the code quality was extremely high.  Most of the problems came with integrating with GWT.. so glad I don’t have to do that anymore"
720,2017-09-03T10:46:44.000040,Collette,You're lucky then
720,2017-09-03T10:47:03.000005,Meg,"I guess what I’m trying to say is in a community like this, you get more resources from multiple people than just relying on one person :slightly_smiling_face:"
720,2017-09-03T10:47:17.000027,Collette,"I'm definitely fan of a very specific, well-written, tested in-house library that does the thing"

720,2017-09-03T10:47:32.000008,Collette,"None of that applies to our current developers, unfortunately"
720,2017-09-03T10:54:53.000012,Monty,"no, I was not really looking for a mentor, I was looking for someone to answer some  questions when I get stuck,  5-10 minutes max, but as you said, I can get that help on the <#C07EFMZ1N|help> channel...maybe I was thinking that you are the only living person on that channel :smile:"

723,2017-09-03T12:33:34.000013,Krysta,Does anyone know how i can split this string into multiple parts ```'media/Clearance.png?sometexthere'``` ideally i'd like just the Clearance.png
723,2017-09-03T12:34:15.000015,Krysta,"so if i was splitting it it'd be 'media/', 'Clearance.png' and '?sometexthere'"
723,2017-09-03T12:47:15.000070,Krysta,"I have ```f = imgString.split('medias/')[1]
g = f.split('?')[0]
print(g)``` but i'd prefer it on one line"
723,2017-09-03T12:49:47.000017,Beula,"If it's always a similar format you could regex it and get the groups, but that's less obvious and I'd favor a few lines to a single line if it isn't as clean "
723,2017-09-03T12:50:43.000027,Krysta,"Yeah the image name will change, but media/ and ? stay the same, i'll probs stick to what i have, it works so :smile:"
723,2017-09-03T13:02:24.000022,Meg,"if so, you can use the `urlparse` library"
723,2017-09-03T13:06:09.000004,Meg,"outputs this

```
In [27]: parsed
Out[27]: ParseResult(scheme='', netloc='', path='media/Clearance.png', params='', query='sometexthere', fragment='')

Out[29]: 'Clearance.png'

723,2017-09-03T13:19:17.000010,Krysta,Yeah i'm scraping with bs4 and the image name ie (Clearance) changes so I can't reference it

725,2017-09-03T14:13:47.000094,Glinda,"I'm trying to understand how I can implement the google speech api for my purposes. There's a good example by them `<https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/blob/master/speech/cloud-client/transcribe_streaming_mic.py#L170>` That deals with streaming from a mic. I've gotten this `transcribe_streaming_mic.py` to work. But I'm a little confused with if I should be using async vs sync.... and how to modify this for my use case. I want to only collect up to five seconds of data at a time with the ability to short circuit the `listen_print_loop` if a certain condition is met. I'm think I can put a timer around the `with MicrophoneStream` and I can have the listen_print_loop(responses) throw an exception when it meets a certain condition (timeout= 5 seconds, or correct response). Catch this response in the main and do something based upon it.

I'm going through their api reference docs to see if there's something I can use: `<https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/speech/gapic/api.html>`"

730,2017-09-04T08:50:43.000194,Suellen,It's useful when you need to test your codebase against a matrix of dependencies
730,2017-09-04T08:51:16.000113,Suellen,"i.e. you webapp supports Django 1.11, 1.10 and 1.9; and it also works with Python 2.7 and 3.3+"
730,2017-09-04T08:51:42.000436,Suellen,just `make test` or `py.test` will only test against your current configuration
730,2017-09-04T08:51:55.000232,Ciera,or to run multiple test one after another :slightly_smiling_face:
730,2017-09-04T08:53:11.000038,Lanita,"Right now, with my django tests, I'm using manage.py test, but that's inside of the env. I guess you'd use tox as an alternative to starting a specific venv and running the tests"

730,2017-09-04T08:55:12.000011,Ciera,as tox is widely use some tools allow you to put their configuration inside the `tox.ini` file to limit the number of configuration file
730,2017-09-04T08:55:22.000117,Ciera,I have no idea if mypy allow that
730,2017-09-04T08:55:34.000041,Ciera,there might be a command line arg to pass the configuration file

731,2017-09-04T12:42:07.000059,Gabriele,you have typed the path incorrectly
731,2017-09-04T12:42:10.000139,Lana,"Well, You have to know, I'm not running it whitin a venv :see_no_evil:"
731,2017-09-04T12:42:17.000234,Lana,Oh
731,2017-09-04T12:42:19.000096,Gabriele,which is at least one argument against using a full path
731,2017-09-04T12:43:33.000087,Lana,You think maybe a solution could be setting up a venv?
731,2017-09-04T12:43:42.000116,Lana,Or makes no difference :confused:
731,2017-09-04T12:46:26.000135,Gabriele,Your most immediate solution is just to type that path out correctly.
731,2017-09-04T12:46:44.000014,Gabriele,Your second solution is to work out why you seem to be running the program from somewhere other than where the XML file is.
731,2017-09-04T12:49:32.000254,Lana,"Ok I found the full path, thanks... Tacos but, still thinking about the venv, maybe that's a better solution (beginner with that stuff, don't know if the venv really matters)"
731,2017-09-04T12:49:40.000193,Lana,:taco: <@Gabriele>
731,2017-09-04T12:50:14.000116,Lana,"And, if yes, I have a serious problem because I just moved from atom to MacVim :S"
731,2017-09-04T12:50:50.000191,Lana,"And I'm kinda new using it so, I don't know anything about running venv's in vim."
731,2017-09-04T12:50:52.000115,Gabriele,Virtualenvs wouldn't really change the nature of this problem. Mostly it just ensures that your libraries are exactly what you want them to be.
731,2017-09-04T12:53:21.000151,Lana,"Oh, nevermind then... Thanks again, bro"
731,2017-09-04T13:05:56.000221,Lana,"Ok, another question (I really need to wonder if I really learned Python)... Uhhh"
731,2017-09-04T13:06:59.000082,Lana,"I have this:
```import xml.etree.ElementTree as et

class Finder():
    version = 'RVR1960' # Default version in Spanish Bible
    tree = et.parse('/Users/alfonsoima/Documents/Universidad/Python/Bible/RVR1960.xml')
    bible = tree.getroot()

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def find(book = ""Génesis"", chv = ""1:1""):
        try:
            cha, ver = chv.split(':')
        except:
            cha = chv
            ver = '1'
        finally:
            return bible.find('./b[@n=""{}""]/c[@n=""{}""]/v[@n=""{}""]'.format(book, cha, ver))
```
And the shell prompts this:
`NameError: name 'bible' is not defined `"
731,2017-09-04T13:08:22.000039,Lana,"So, I tried with the `global bible` then `return bible.find(args)` but still didn't work."
731,2017-09-04T13:08:53.000184,Lana,And `self.bible` neither works.
731,2017-09-04T13:13:54.000032,Johana,your class isn’t being created properly. Your `def find()` method has no ‘self’ being passed into it so it would need to be decorated with `@staticmethod`.
731,2017-09-04T13:18:01.000062,Johana,"i would suggest structuring you class a little differently. I would pass in that full path like so

```
class Finder(object):
    def __init__(self, version, xml_path):
        self.version = version
        self.xml_path = xml_path
        self.tree = et.parse(xml_path)
        self.bible = tree.getroot()

    def find(self, book, chv):
        try:
            cha, ver chv.split()
        except SomeError:
            cha = chv
            ver = '1'
        finally:
            . . . 
```"
731,2017-09-04T13:19:53.000148,Johana,"then you can do 

```
finder = Finder('1.0', '/path/to/xml_file.xml')
book = finder.find(book='Genesis', chv='1:1')
```"
731,2017-09-04T13:21:13.000140,Johana,<@Lana> :point_up:
731,2017-09-04T13:22:12.000134,Lana,Why am I so bad structuring this stuff while you guys are awesome?
731,2017-09-04T13:22:27.000122,Lana,:taco: <@Johana>
731,2017-09-04T13:24:27.000045,Johana,it’s just experience :wink:.
731,2017-09-04T13:24:30.000207,Johana,you’ll get there.
731,2017-09-04T13:25:21.000054,Johana,you may also want to start introducing some assumptions for sanity’s sake.
731,2017-09-04T13:25:54.000060,Johana,for example an app/script that finds things in bible xml should be able to safely assume where the files are located…
731,2017-09-04T13:28:37.000027,Johana,"i think having to specify the full_path is unnecessary. could offer a way for the user to override this behavior by doing this:

```
def __init__(self, xml_path=None):
    if xml_path:
        self.xml_path = xml_path
    else:
        self.xml_path = '/path/to/file'
```"
731,2017-09-04T13:29:27.000211,Lana,Sounds awesome...
731,2017-09-04T13:29:50.000037,Lana,"And, about the experience, I have ~1 year and... Nothing I can say :stuck_out_tongue:"
731,2017-09-04T13:30:37.000138,Johana,scripts never die so it’s best to design them in a way you can run them and they work for the most part b/c 3 months from now you might not remember :wink:.
731,2017-09-04T13:30:54.000173,Johana,i love having defaults that just work.
732,2017-09-04T15:29:12.000058,Sidney,The Bible was written in XML?

732,2017-09-04T15:45:14.000027,Britteny,Think it was originally written in YAML and King James converted it to XML

733,2017-09-04T16:32:44.000095,Carie,"Hello, I have mind problem with TDD using mock. 
I can't just break through this: 
How can I write test before my code using mocking if I'm not exactly sure what I want to use?
It's nice when You're testing behavior of something but when it comes to use some side-effect generating objects it's unbreakable wall for me.
I know how to write unittest, mock things .etc but I don't really know how to do testing before code when 
I'm not sure what will fit best.
For example when I'm using paramiko to do some sftp staff I simply can't predict every thing I do because I don't really know this lib enough. (Well, I know paramiko, this is just example :D)
When I'm trying stuff and checking how it works... well I'm ending up with already created solution... and then pre-testing is becoming a post-testing which shouldn't be done in TDD

halp
:confused:"
733,2017-09-04T17:00:38.000150,Beula,"<@Carie> I think you'd generally do best by ""wrapping"" the external lib and then testing those functions, you can define a noop function and write tests around it (obviously they fail immediately). Then you integrate the external lib into those functions (so none of your main app code uses the external lib, since that's an ""implementation detail"") and keep going until it's passing."
734,2017-09-04T23:27:35.000140,Eartha,"hi guys, quick question, im trying to make a really simple crud api. does this make sense?

735,2017-09-05T05:05:56.000023,Lanita,"`from typing import Iterable, Iterator, Sequence`

An iterator describes the actual iterator object (e.g. what you get back when you run `iter(some_list)`).
An Iterable is some object `xs` that you can do `for x in xs: ...`
A Sequence describes an object `xs` that is an Iterable that also allows you to grab a specific element, e.g. `xs[4]` (that is, xs has a `__getitem__` method defined). An Iterable MAY have `__getitem__`, but a Sequence MUST have it.

Correct?"
735,2017-09-05T05:07:30.000033,Lanita,"So, when I'm annotating a function, I could use Iterable if I want some duck typing and I know that I won't be accessing a specific member of the object, but I have to use Sequence if I ever access a specific member (e.g. I'll run `xs[-1]` at some point, if xs is the object we're annotating)"
735,2017-09-05T05:08:40.000094,Ciera,seems correct
735,2017-09-05T05:09:13.000129,Lanita,"This is all in the context of type annotations btw, which is why the official definitions as found in the docs might not match up"
735,2017-09-05T05:11:59.000279,Lanita,"I really wish that the Callable type annotation was more advanced... It'd be cool if I could for example create a NewType for a Django view function, being a ""Callable whose first argument is HttpRequest, ignoring all the other aspects"". Right now the annotation is `Callable[[arg1, arg2], return_type]`, but there's no way of doing e.g. `Callable[[HttpRequest, ...], Any]`"
735,2017-09-05T05:15:18.000362,Collette,<@Lanita> why would you annotate a django's view function?
735,2017-09-05T05:18:51.000221,Lanita,"<@Collette>, it would make it clearer when writing e.g. decorators"
735,2017-09-05T05:56:14.000181,Collette,"<@Lanita> this is a very, very specific use-case. I doubt it's worth it to introduce a custom syntax to handle this case (imo, a good type checker should infer all necessary information automatically), but you can always open a feature request"
735,2017-09-05T06:40:20.000328,Lanita,"<@Collette> No, it's not anywhere near ""very very"" user specific. This is a standard part of python function definition syntax. E.g. doing `def f(some_arg, *rest_of_args)`"
735,2017-09-05T06:40:52.000399,Lanita,"Being able to annotate that function as `Callable[[type(some_arg), ...], Any]` would be neat"
735,2017-09-05T06:42:28.000097,Lanita,"It's also common when ""overloading"" methods in classes, e.g. class A has `def some_method(arg1)`, class B which inherits from class A has `def some_method(arg1, extra_arg)`"
735,2017-09-05T06:49:07.000230,Lanita,example of similar things proposed: <https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3157>
735,2017-09-05T07:47:10.000032,Collette,"<@Lanita> you're implying that type annotations should be everywhere. No, they don't.
It would be good if `typing` would support that use-case, but to me it doesn't seem so much critical at all."
735,2017-09-05T07:47:55.000127,Lanita,"Well multiple people clearly think otherwise, as proven by the various issues on mypy with positive response regarding this subject..."
735,2017-09-05T07:52:19.000006,Collette,"Even more people haven't participated in these issues, who may have another opinion. But let's not discuss that.

Again, I'm not against this feature. I just think that
a) annotating everything will destroy one of the most important features of python (to me) - readability,
b) therefore it would be better to improve static type checkers to infer as much as possible;
c) however, I think we can live without type checking in this specific use-case because we lived without `typing` module for a quite long time and sky didn't fall, but
d) it won't hurt anyone if this feature is supported. Some folks will definitely find it useful."
736,2017-09-05T07:47:30.000072,Collette,"That's why I proposed you to create a feature request, and looks like it's created already by someone else"
737,2017-09-05T14:09:09.000119,Meghan,"I have a string with a method name in it, I'm looking for a way to call that function on an instanced object identifying the method by the name of the string.

This somewhat works, but is ugly as can be:
```instance.__class__.__dict__[method_name](instance)```
Except, these are inherited objects, and inherited methods aren't accessible.

There must be a better way."
737,2017-09-05T14:15:47.000476,Meghan,"Actually, it looks like ```getattr``` will do that. Slightly less ugly."
737,2017-09-05T14:16:22.000208,Winnifred,maybe something like:

737,2017-09-05T14:19:34.000429,Winnifred,"if you expect this behavior, you may be able to add methods to class that operate on state of instance"
737,2017-09-05T14:20:22.000252,Meghan,I'm not sure what you mean.
737,2017-09-05T14:21:27.000341,Winnifred,"you’re operating on an instance of a class, why not write a method on instance to take in `self`?"
737,2017-09-05T14:29:21.000623,Meghan,I'm still not sure what you mean. Example code?
737,2017-09-05T14:43:40.000477,Winnifred,"This is what im thinking, but I don’t actually know what your function is doing."
737,2017-09-05T14:58:18.000348,Meghan,"Sorry, got distracted.

I see what you are saying. I think the getattr fits what I'm doing better."
737,2017-09-05T14:59:53.000623,Meghan,"I realize I didn't describe how I got there, so it makes it difficult. It is just a lot of code across different modules.

But, it's from a modular gui in kivy that is listing a pretty version of a method name, the user selects what objects, and from there what methods to run, and kivy then sends on the list of strings. It's been interesting, for sure."
738,2017-09-05T15:33:17.000555,Winnifred,"ah yeah, I was making assumptions about what you were doing :neutral_face:"

744,2017-09-06T09:45:40.000160,Meg,that's your problem there
744,2017-09-06T09:45:50.000046,Meg,because you need to compare on the actual values in `x2`
744,2017-09-06T09:46:47.000412,Meg,try `where=numeric_timestamp in x2`
744,2017-09-06T09:47:36.000420,Jon,So I should make a new list and check if the *numeric* timestamps are in there?
744,2017-09-06T09:48:12.000663,Meg,no need.  look at my example above
744,2017-09-06T09:48:27.000080,Meg,"ah, correction"
744,2017-09-06T09:48:28.000088,Meg,yes
744,2017-09-06T09:48:38.000016,Meg,you can use a list comprehesion for that
744,2017-09-06T09:50:46.000663,Jon,"Something like this?
`where=[x for x in x2 if x in list]`"
744,2017-09-06T09:53:26.000104,Meg,"so, the `where` param uses a comparison to evaulate as true/false to determine where fill happens"

744,2017-09-06T09:57:29.000631,Jon,Where numeric_timestamp is my chosen value
744,2017-09-06T09:58:55.000412,Meg,"<@Jon> correct.  In your code example, `numeric_timestamp = 990014340000000000`"
744,2017-09-06T10:01:24.000030,Jon,"<@Meg>, I dont know if I'm missing something now...

I did `(x2[0] + x2[-1])/2` and got `9.9001434e+17`

744,2017-09-06T10:06:03.000176,Jon,"Because `len([x for x in x2 if x &gt; 990002640000000000 ])` = 457

<@Meg>"
744,2017-09-06T10:06:39.000430,Davida,"That gives me a set of values as such:

```

I have created a IAM User with only the PutObject policy, but how can I request the credentials for this user without having to store it in a file or hardcode it? Any ideas?"

747,2017-09-06T12:12:37.000417,Beula,"The problem with distributing them is that then any user can generate signed requests for uploads to the bucket (if your policy is set well, that may be okay - but I don't think the policy allows you to control sizes).

However, I have absolutely no experience in Python, Django &amp; any kind of hosting beside fully-managed VPS or shared. Now, since the beginning of my ""learning"" journey, I've stumbled across many tutorials that were for Linux &amp; I also read about some Python libraries that were not compatible with Windows at all... So I would like to know if I should install a Linux partition to start my project (which would add another layer of complexity since I haven't touched Linux since ~10 years). Would it be worth it to take the time to install Ubuntu, learn how it works and how to set up the hosting or would I be perfectly fine just staying on Windows with PyCharm (here though, I am quite scared about the moment where we will have to deploy in production xD) Thanks!"
750,2017-09-06T17:52:32.000275,Junita,You’ll definitely want to get a bit of a sense for how it’ll be hosted and learn some of the ins and outs of it.
750,2017-09-06T17:53:04.000430,Junita,But I don’t know that you need to go as far as installing Ubuntu - I’d recommend Docker.  It has its own learning curve (although personally I don’t find it to be that steep)
750,2017-09-06T17:53:38.000061,Junita,"But it’ll allow you to work in Windows, but run the application in the same Linux environment it will run in on the server"

750,2017-09-06T17:53:53.000331,Junita,and it allows you to pull in things easily like Postgres or Redis

750,2017-09-06T17:55:12.000288,Junita,"But you’ll need to learn how it’s going to be hosted, and in my opinion investing the time learning docker rather than running linux and how to put all the rest of it together that way will take you a lot further"
750,2017-09-06T17:55:30.000256,Forrest,cool
750,2017-09-06T17:55:56.000079,Junita,"there are plenty of docker lovers here and in <#C22DMH61M|devops> too, so if you get stuck and need help, just ask"
750,2017-09-06T17:56:01.000108,Forrest,do you know if hosts can usually help with this?
750,2017-09-06T17:56:28.000483,Forrest,it's free?
750,2017-09-06T17:57:07.000026,Junita,"Docker itself is free (the community edition at least, but that’s all you need)"
750,2017-09-06T17:57:34.000053,Junita,"Hosting it of course will require you to pay somebody, but docker has some nice tools to get you running with that on AWS or other cloud providers"
750,2017-09-06T17:58:09.000061,Forrest,We're on a VPS
750,2017-09-06T17:59:30.000271,Junita,Are you tied to this VPS?
750,2017-09-06T18:00:12.000236,Forrest,"Hmmm, I wouldn't say so, but to start the project we'll be using it since my friend is already paying it for his (small) WP site"
750,2017-09-06T18:00:45.000325,Junita,If you sign up for AWS you get a decent amount of free tier credit.
750,2017-09-06T18:01:03.000040,Junita,"I’d recommend against sharing the hosting with other things, especially WordPress."
750,2017-09-06T18:01:39.000358,Forrest,For security?
750,2017-09-06T18:02:18.000450,Junita,"yeah security, ease of management, etc."
750,2017-09-06T18:03:05.000137,Forrest,"The issue I ran into when I was checking hosts like Heroku, AWS was that it seems like people ends up paying a ton... So I checked DO, which looked nice but it's not managed. After, I found WebFaction and my friend already had a managed VPS on HostWinds so we thought it would be a good start lol"
750,2017-09-06T18:03:57.000297,Junita,A lot can be done on Heroku on the free tier actually
750,2017-09-06T18:04:58.000305,Junita,"And I mean yeah you can end up paying a ton on AWS as you scale up, but honestly at the kind of scale that becomes an issue it’s not really feasible to be doing this sort of stuff on managed VPS boxes"
750,2017-09-06T18:05:13.000181,Forrest,Oh
750,2017-09-06T18:05:45.000222,Forrest,"So it might be possible for me to make the project on free Heroku to showcase it, then move it or scale up"
750,2017-09-06T18:05:52.000060,Junita,yup
750,2017-09-06T18:06:11.000423,Forrest,I will look into this
750,2017-09-06T18:06:41.000138,Forrest,"It's a bit scary though lol, with the Dynos and the Databases and everything seems to be customizable haha..."
750,2017-09-06T18:06:51.000159,Junita,ha.  it’s not so bad.
750,2017-09-06T18:07:17.000277,Forrest,Im used to run PHP with MySQL/PHPMyAdmin on a shared hosting :stuck_out_tongue:
750,2017-09-06T18:07:25.000251,Junita,"it’s mostly a terminology issue, they complicate things with these crazy names like “dyno”"
750,2017-09-06T18:08:15.000354,Junita,"this stuff, in a sense, isn’t much different than what you did.  a “dyno” on heroku is basically just an instance of your application"
750,2017-09-06T18:08:30.000043,Junita,and you put some files in standardized places so it knows how to run it
750,2017-09-06T18:09:51.000142,Junita,the big difference between running a python (or ruby or node) type web app and something like PHP via say Apache is that in Python you’ll usually run the application and have a webserver connect to via its ip address
750,2017-09-06T18:11:02.000200,Junita,"so the user talks to say, Apache, like normal, and then instead of running mod_php or whatever inside apache, it will run what’s called a reverse proxy and send the connections to your web application’s ip and port"
750,2017-09-06T18:11:16.000397,Forrest,oh
750,2017-09-06T18:11:38.000290,Forrest,that sounds weird to me lol
750,2017-09-06T18:12:24.000389,Junita,"ha.  it does seem kind of weird at first, but it can be beneficial, because for example you can have many workers behind a simple reverse proxy"
750,2017-09-06T18:12:55.000176,Junita,and it’s also possible to develop locally without needing the whole big heavy apache server
750,2017-09-06T18:13:07.000002,Forrest,"well, weird or not, I am very interested in both Python and NodeJS so gotta learn haha"
750,2017-09-06T18:13:22.000356,Forrest,I saw that Django seems to come with a kind of webserver on its own
750,2017-09-06T18:13:38.000459,Junita,"yup, so that the reverse proxy can connect to it"
750,2017-09-06T18:13:44.000168,Junita,and so you can develop locally
750,2017-09-06T18:16:32.000007,Forrest,I see
750,2017-09-06T18:16:48.000211,Forrest,"So, my learning stack would be: Docker -&gt; Heroku -&gt; Python -&gt; Django?"
750,2017-09-06T18:17:37.000244,Junita,That’s up to you - you probably could get started with Django on Windows without too much fuss.
750,2017-09-06T18:18:11.000254,Junita,"But in my experience things like Node or Python projects do tend to be more oriented towards unix like operating systems, so problems can arise."
750,2017-09-06T18:18:25.000073,Junita,"So yeah, to your original point, putting things in Ubuntu would help there."
750,2017-09-06T18:19:07.000220,Junita,"But there’s a learning cost, so in my opinion it’s worth it to just learn Docker instead, it’ll give you the same benefits and so many more."
750,2017-09-06T18:19:31.000044,Junita,"And then too when you go to deploy the site, you can rest easy knowing you are deploying the same thing you developed on."
750,2017-09-06T18:19:41.000421,Britteny,Docker and Python have some decent courses on Pluralsight if you have a subscription.  The Django course there is kinda old now
750,2017-09-06T18:19:44.000269,Forrest,"Yeah... I am not very good in the ""sys"" side so the faster I can start coding, the faster I will be comfortable building the site lol xD"
750,2017-09-06T18:20:16.000051,Junita,"oh that’s a good idea, yeah a course like that might help jumpstart things a bit"
750,2017-09-06T18:20:30.000135,Forrest,I don't have an inscription but they give a 10 days free trial
750,2017-09-06T18:20:56.000148,Junita,and that’s sort of the interesting thing too - Docker seems to many to be “advanced” but I actually think it helps do a good job of obfuscating a lot of the sys admin stuff pretty well
750,2017-09-06T18:21:28.000063,Junita,"so that in the end that yes, you need to learn this tool, but things overall get a lot simpler."
750,2017-09-06T18:21:47.000092,Forrest,okay
750,2017-09-06T18:22:07.000043,Forrest,well I suppose I could deal with Docker at the same time as I learn about Heroku
750,2017-09-06T18:22:43.000114,Forrest,hum <@Britteny> do you have any specific course for Docker to recommend on pluralsight? There's like 63... xD
750,2017-09-06T18:23:17.000274,Junita,"yeah, make sure you feel comfortable with a simple hello world django app locally first"
750,2017-09-06T18:24:07.000216,Britteny,Getting Started with Docker - was good
750,2017-09-06T18:24:42.000034,Britteny,"Also, for Python “Python Fundamentals” and “Python – Beyond the Basics” really helped me"
750,2017-09-06T18:25:21.000082,Forrest,oh nice they are much shorter than Udemy too lol
750,2017-09-06T18:26:22.000351,Britteny,"Beyond the Basics is longer, but in my opinion there is no filler.  It’s all great stuff.  Actually, Beyond the Basics I think is the best screencast I’ve seen"
750,2017-09-06T18:26:31.000081,Georgiana,Hey guys
750,2017-09-06T18:26:55.000024,Georgiana,Could you list the most typical questions on python interview?
750,2017-09-06T18:28:50.000142,Eve,Is python pass by reference or value?
750,2017-09-06T18:28:53.000164,Junita,I think that’d largely depend on the position
750,2017-09-06T18:29:56.000444,Georgiana,I am applying to back-end role
750,2017-09-06T18:30:50.000274,Junita,"Junior, or senior?"
750,2017-09-06T18:30:57.000063,Georgiana,by value;)
750,2017-09-06T18:31:03.000230,Georgiana,Middle
750,2017-09-06T18:31:49.000312,Junita,not all arguments are by value
750,2017-09-06T18:32:04.000088,Eve,Explain the HTTP Request/Response process
750,2017-09-06T18:32:46.000176,Eve,"Describe RESTful APIs, HTTP verbs, idempotent, etc"
750,2017-09-06T18:32:59.000282,Junita,"actually a common related question is about mutable default arguments, since many people don’t realize that each time a function or method is instantiated, it gets a reference to the same object"
750,2017-09-06T18:34:03.000070,Junita,"so if you have `foo(bar=[])` and modify bar in foo, each run of foo() will be modifyin the same default bar"
750,2017-09-06T18:35:48.000208,Junita,"MVC architecture will often come up, as well as perhaps some questions about [No]SQL or any ORMs you have experience with."
750,2017-09-06T18:36:23.000339,Eve,"Definitely, also maybe some basic SQL, joins, 3rd normal form, etc"
750,2017-09-06T18:37:49.000317,Junita,"CORS, CSRF tokens, other security related questions might come up as well."
750,2017-09-06T18:39:03.000291,Junita,mid-level is tough for both the interviewer and the interviewee because a mid-level is naturally not going to know certain things
750,2017-09-06T18:39:06.000019,Britteny,"I’m finding this kind of interesting.  When I interview these days, which has only really been for seniors recently, I’m generally looking for qualities above and beyond technical skills.  Your CV and Github / provided code should give evidence of that, and then I just want to understand  -how you solve problems, how do you learn something new, how do you work with your colleagues, how curious are you, how enthusiastic are you, when do you ask for help versus research on your own, etc"
750,2017-09-06T18:40:01.000226,Junita,yeah I certainly have moved away from a focus on very technical interview questions
750,2017-09-06T18:40:05.000252,Britteny,"I find I ask no more than about 25 mins of tech questions, but then drop in stuff like ‘Have you seen the new feature in Node 8, what’s your opinion of async/await versus promises’"
750,2017-09-06T18:40:28.000258,Britteny,(we are mainly a JS environment)
750,2017-09-06T18:40:57.000157,Junita,yeah I think that’s a good approach.  give people a topic and let them run with it and they’ll tell you a lot about themselves
750,2017-09-06T18:41:19.000226,Eve,"I like the async/await vs promises, basically language features, or differences between languages even and get their opinion"
750,2017-09-06T18:41:33.000127,Junita,I also like to talk to people about projects they’ve worked on in a very conversational manner.  I find it can tell a lot
750,2017-09-06T18:42:33.000042,Beula,"I usually ask stuff about what they're into, what excites them, their favorite projects they've been on"
750,2017-09-06T18:43:05.000087,Britteny,"All of the above, yeah.  If they can’t talk coherently about the design choices and trade-offs they’ve made, then they’re not really fluent enough with the tech"
750,2017-09-06T18:43:14.000413,Britteny,For a senior role
750,2017-09-06T18:43:35.000232,Britteny,"I’ve not interviewed for juniors in 10 years, which is a bit sad really as we need to do more of that"
750,2017-09-06T18:44:18.000189,Junita,interviewing a junior is basically flipping a coin. lol
750,2017-09-06T18:46:48.000132,Georgiana,"Looks I am the only ""lucky guy"" with questions about big O"
750,2017-09-06T18:46:57.000168,Georgiana,and internals of JVM
750,2017-09-06T18:47:26.000228,Georgiana,I am more a Java-developer but also looking for a python role
750,2017-09-06T18:47:40.000268,Britteny,"Haha.. wow.  I think it depends on who you interview with.  We’re not trying to be google and have the best engineering team.  We want to solve our customer’s problems, even those they haven’t been able to explain to us"
750,2017-09-06T18:52:19.000156,Eve,"Big O, algorithms, traverse a binary search tree in order, post order, pre order, but then your role has very little to do with that.  I mean I understand needing to know fundamentals but those questions have always bothered me."
750,2017-09-06T18:53:39.000004,Eve,But Java roles seem to like those types of questions.
750,2017-09-06T18:55:32.000381,Junita,Yeah agreed.  And honestly an interviewer asking those sorts of questions to me is a huge red flag about a place.
750,2017-09-06T18:59:29.000208,Georgiana,I am ok with questions about datastructs and access/search time because you use datastructs every day
750,2017-09-06T19:00:28.000066,Junita,"yeah, that’s true, there are.  and that’s actually an important thing as a job seeker.  don’t settle for a place raising a bunch of red flags if possible."
751,2017-09-06T18:58:51.000223,Georgiana,But there are many red flags though
751,2017-09-06T19:00:34.000143,Georgiana,But writing an optimal solution having 5 minutes when interviewer is near you - it is weird
752,2017-09-06T19:37:55.000081,Eve,Weird and just not how you do your day to day job.  I'm not what information interviewers think they gleaning from a candidate in those situations.
752,2017-09-06T19:47:16.000127,Suellen,"it's neither by value, nor by reference"
752,2017-09-06T19:53:41.000040,Mallie,"That's always been my issue with smaller companies following suit with the ""Google style"" of interviewing blindly. They fail to realize that these methods are essentially an ongoing experiment executed by organizations that can afford teams the size of companies to crunch the data and adjust processes, and absorb high failure rates (and the corresponding cost) because of their revenue per engineer and never-ending pipeline of candidates due to their size. Google and others are quite open about their attempts to quantify hiring and that it isn't a solved problem. It's all fairly interesting, but many people are too quick to get tunnel vision on the ""best practices"" of hiring and make it awful for the company and the candidate in the process, creating a market for interviewing skills that, like timgraf said, have no direct relation to day-to-day work."
752,2017-09-06T20:10:02.000166,Eve,"I think this was posted to a channel here not too long ago

<http://robertheaton.com/2014/02/09/pythons-pass-by-object-reference-as-explained-by-philip-k-dick/>"
753,2017-09-06T21:49:51.000121,Bruno,"even with all ""blockers"" disabled or whatever."
753,2017-09-06T23:25:11.000052,Lana,"Is there a way to order words in the terminal? (MacOS/Linux)
```
The words looks li
ke this
```
And..
```
I want them
like this
```"
753,2017-09-06T23:27:48.000011,Bruno,not simply like that.
753,2017-09-06T23:28:24.000107,Bruno,you can take a list of words and sort them with `sort`. but it simply sorts lines from stdout
753,2017-09-06T23:28:46.000076,Lana,I think I didn't explain myself
753,2017-09-06T23:28:52.000121,Bruno,"❯ echo ""a\nc\nb"" | sort
a
b
c"
753,2017-09-06T23:31:22.000068,Lana,"I want them not ""sorted"" but without splitting them among lines"
753,2017-09-06T23:31:32.000015,Bruno,ok
753,2017-09-06T23:32:09.000063,Bruno,can you paste that text in here?
753,2017-09-06T23:33:10.000024,Lana,"I'll use a lot of texts (actually, it's for a python project I'm working on), use any Bible verse, for example"
753,2017-09-06T23:35:25.000113,Bruno,yea just a sec
753,2017-09-06T23:37:06.000217,Bruno,"<@Charles> 
```
❯ echo ""i am blah bla bla words just fill asdf asdf \ndoo"" | tr "" "" ""\n"" | sort | tr ""\n"" "" ""
 am asdf asdf bla bla blah doo fill i just words
```"
753,2017-09-06T23:37:22.000078,Bruno,the command `tr` replaces text.
753,2017-09-06T23:37:46.000158,Bruno,so make all spaces new lines. then simply `sort` them. then make new lines spaces
753,2017-09-06T23:39:17.000069,Bruno,"but also note in this case, you will end up with a blank line. so you may want to make sure that may not happen."
753,2017-09-06T23:39:23.000072,Bruno,if possible
753,2017-09-06T23:42:11.000101,Lana,"Nope, not working :confused:"
753,2017-09-06T23:42:30.000072,Bruno,are you on linux or osx?
753,2017-09-06T23:42:34.000042,Bruno,whats the error?
753,2017-09-06T23:42:35.000078,Lana,OSX
753,2017-09-06T23:44:05.000200,Lana,"I don't want that split:
```
word 1 word 2 wo
rd 3 # I don't w
ant this
==================
word 1 word 2
word 3 # This one
```"
753,2017-09-06T23:44:53.000070,Bruno,"ok with the above, what is the expected output"
753,2017-09-06T23:45:32.000086,Bruno,so you also want to remove comments after the hash `#` ?
753,2017-09-06T23:46:01.000207,Lana,Nope...
753,2017-09-06T23:46:09.000180,Bruno,oh i see
753,2017-09-06T23:46:17.000178,Lana,I just want to NOT split the words
753,2017-09-06T23:46:47.000127,Lana,That's frustrating for those (including me) who love to read...
753,2017-09-06T23:47:04.000108,Bruno,ok. thats going to be harder to do intelligently. since what if those are actually 2 different words
753,2017-09-06T23:48:09.000161,Bruno,"such as is it a new line, or is it a ""word wrap"" which isnt a true new line. but to bash it looks like one."
753,2017-09-06T23:49:45.000073,Bruno,"joining the lines is easy. with simply `tr ""\n"" "" ""` its just where to do it and make sure the split words are kept whole."
753,2017-09-06T23:54:39.000042,Lana,I tried with `tput rmam`
753,2017-09-06T23:54:52.000192,Lana,But Terminal just gone crazy
753,2017-09-06T23:56:40.000031,Bruno,yea.
753,2017-09-06T23:57:35.000019,Lana,"*FINAL*: Just came from MacOS Feedback page, looks like I'm not the only one with this issue (There's no possible solution right now in OSX Terminal or xterm for Linux Users)."
753,2017-09-06T23:57:36.000027,Bruno,unfortunately doing this is easy until you try to keep the words from being split. sorting is the easy part as is joining lines. even in bash.
753,2017-09-06T23:58:01.000221,Bruno,this isnt a bash issue really. its kind of a machine learning issue. though simple.
753,2017-09-06T23:58:15.000109,Bruno,as you are trying to detect whole and real words
753,2017-09-06T23:59:45.000082,Lana,"I'll develop my code to detect the width of the window (In characters) and do the `""\n""`thing when words cannot fill in the current line"
753,2017-09-06T23:59:55.000173,Lana,hope that works.
753,2017-09-07T00:00:16.000091,Lana,Thanks anyway <@Bruno> You made a great effort
753,2017-09-07T00:00:31.000042,Lana,You deserve this... :taco: <@Bruno>
753,2017-09-07T00:00:58.000014,Bruno,"when the word is split is there never a space after it and only a new line? and when the word is NOT split, is there always a space PLUS a new line?"
753,2017-09-07T00:01:04.000175,Bruno,lol thanks
753,2017-09-07T00:02:19.000006,Lana,I don't get it
753,2017-09-07T00:03:11.000110,Bruno,"if thats the case, you can change all only new lines with nothing, and space newline with space. so 
```
echo ""..."" | tr "" \n"" "" "" | tr ""\n"" """"
```"
753,2017-09-07T00:03:46.000091,Bruno,so. in your example above.
753,2017-09-07T00:04:14.000213,Bruno,"```
word 1 word 2 wo
rd 3 # I don't 
want this
```"
753,2017-09-07T00:05:03.000014,Bruno,"`wo` is split onto a new line from `rd`. and `don't` is split from another whole word `want` only 1 word is being split there, correct?"
753,2017-09-07T00:05:46.000242,Lana,I think I'm not getting your explanation
753,2017-09-07T00:05:53.000018,Bruno,"what i mean, if `wo` has no spaces before `rd`, meaning its the same as `wo\nrd`."
753,2017-09-07T00:05:57.000129,Lana,I just want to disable text-wrapping
753,2017-09-07T00:06:26.000009,Bruno,and `don't` and `want` is split with a space AND a new line. so that its actually `don't \nwant`
753,2017-09-07T00:06:39.000092,Bruno,then you could work with that.
753,2017-09-07T00:06:56.000220,Bruno,since `SPACE` + `\n` always means whole words.
753,2017-09-07T00:07:14.000018,Bruno,"and `\n` by itself, is a slit word"

759,2017-09-07T11:22:26.000413,Johana,<@Orpha> :point_up: i have two examples there.
759,2017-09-07T11:23:56.000736,Orpha,I was looking for more of an add_all replacement 
759,2017-09-07T11:24:51.000049,Johana,add_all ?
759,2017-09-07T11:26:26.000182,Orpha,so right now
759,2017-09-07T11:26:39.000593,Orpha,i have this in a for loop
759,2017-09-07T11:27:07.000774,Johana,oh you are using the orm.
759,2017-09-07T11:27:12.000322,Orpha,yea
759,2017-09-07T11:27:27.000619,Johana,then you will need to use session.merge()
759,2017-09-07T11:27:28.000183,Orpha,i can take it out of the loop and use add_all
759,2017-09-07T11:27:39.000776,Orpha,"ok, yea i was looking at that just now"
759,2017-09-07T11:28:15.000685,Orpha,"im moving files to s3 and storing url in db, but i have to handle duplicates"
759,2017-09-07T11:28:29.000310,Orpha,just incase #clients
759,2017-09-07T11:28:33.000249,Johana,i wouldn’t consider that a bulk insert but ok.
759,2017-09-07T11:28:40.000420,Orpha,fair enough
759,2017-09-07T11:29:23.000887,Johana,through the orm you would have to look through all of them and .merge() them to the system.
759,2017-09-07T11:29:28.000342,Orpha,"i haven’t actually read into it, but im assuming the current way im doing it is bad performance wise"
759,2017-09-07T11:29:45.000749,Johana,"yea, the fastest thing you’ll get is using the core."
759,2017-09-07T11:30:05.000588,Orpha,sort of like doing a raw insert in a for loop 1000x times
759,2017-09-07T11:30:33.000877,Gabriele,Moving the commit out of the loop will likely help a lot
759,2017-09-07T11:30:43.000856,Johana,yea
759,2017-09-07T11:30:48.000059,Johana,it will commit everything at once.
759,2017-09-07T11:30:55.000354,Johana,remember that the session is like a recorder.
759,2017-09-07T11:30:55.000500,Orpha,"yea, that was my other question"
759,2017-09-07T11:31:08.000403,Johana,it records everything in order and executes everything in that order when you do `session.commit()`
759,2017-09-07T11:31:23.000317,Orpha,"is it worth doing a list then add all at once then commit, or just move the commit out"
759,2017-09-07T11:31:33.000019,Gabriele,<@Chu> Why don't you want to use `loads`?
759,2017-09-07T11:31:39.000110,Johana,your loop above is doing an insert statement for every iteration.
759,2017-09-07T11:32:30.000222,Chu,"I'm receiveing string from client side and need to store in database as is. But I need to know that my json is valid. (There is no way to make json field in db, too large db under load)"
759,2017-09-07T11:32:34.000108,Johana,it depends <@Orpha>. how many inserts do you suspect?
759,2017-09-07T11:32:39.000565,Gabriele,"<@Orpha> If there's no good reason why you need to commit after each one, then don't do it. Usually you would commit after a coherent block of work has been completed. In this case, finishing inserting everything is a logical block of work, I'd say"
759,2017-09-07T11:33:04.000105,Gabriele,That doesn't explain why you don't want to use `loads`
759,2017-09-07T11:33:44.000270,Chu,It consumes a lot of memory and CPU time in my scale. Looking for optimization.
759,2017-09-07T11:34:11.000772,Orpha,anywhere from 1 to 7k
759,2017-09-07T11:35:42.000631,Gabriele,"I don't know of a faster way than to use `loads`, sorry"
759,2017-09-07T11:37:41.000458,Orpha,moving the commit out throws the duplicate entry error
759,2017-09-07T11:38:17.000276,Gabriele,the commit won't affect that
759,2017-09-07T11:38:38.000892,Orpha,well… it does
759,2017-09-07T11:38:54.000068,Johana,did you try .merge instead of .add?
759,2017-09-07T11:38:58.000031,Gabriele,"at some point, a commit will happen, and your duplicates will get found"
759,2017-09-07T11:39:08.000016,Orpha,not yet
759,2017-09-07T11:39:13.000061,Orpha,only tried moving the commit out
759,2017-09-07T11:39:47.000166,Gabriele,"moving the commit is to speed things up, that's all"
759,2017-09-07T11:39:58.000034,Johana,:point_up:
759,2017-09-07T11:40:02.000483,Orpha,:thumbsup:
759,2017-09-07T11:40:21.000301,Johana,for ultimate performance gains i urge using the core.
759,2017-09-07T11:40:48.000405,Johana,but if that isn’t of utmost importance … carry on.
759,2017-09-07T11:41:10.000544,Orpha,not the most important
759,2017-09-07T11:41:29.000178,Orpha,so merge needs an existing object?
759,2017-09-07T11:42:08.000175,Orpha,"ah, same duplicate error too"
759,2017-09-07T11:42:12.000390,Johana,i think so.
759,2017-09-07T11:42:29.000025,Johana,yea it will need the id of the entity and it will merge the records.
759,2017-09-07T11:43:20.000063,Orpha,"ah, forget it… ill just leave it as is… it works, and it’s not slow at all… was just bored seeing what other way i could quickly change it to"
759,2017-09-07T11:43:22.000206,Bruno,argh. i keep getting slow connection and connection errors to websites. happens both at home and work. both of which are pretty fast connections. at least 100mpbs. even google search stalls. some times i have to hit the search button again. not connected to vpn. even in incognito window. and other browsers.

759,2017-09-07T11:44:49.000117,Johana,check all your network connections for any outgoing tor nodes
759,2017-09-07T11:45:03.000036,Orpha,^ oh fun
759,2017-09-07T11:45:55.000394,Johana,it does sound like a dns related thing. if it keeps happening you may want to flush your dns.
759,2017-09-07T11:46:13.000516,Johana,maybe even try changing dns servers
759,2017-09-07T11:46:32.000148,Bruno,flushed.
759,2017-09-07T11:47:02.000340,Bruno,yea. i may try using googles.
759,2017-09-07T11:47:12.000100,Orpha,or opendns
759,2017-09-07T11:48:03.000525,Johana,you may want to even do a traceroute and see what hops you’re taking.
759,2017-09-07T11:48:32.000253,Johana,are you on windows?
759,2017-09-07T11:48:56.000776,Bruno,xubuntu. yea tracert is windows. running it now
759,2017-09-07T11:49:21.000466,Bruno,that was pretty quick just to <http://google.com|google.com>
759,2017-09-07T11:50:05.000323,Orpha,Try using a different browser 
759,2017-09-07T12:00:29.000359,Bruno,yea. gonna test vivaldi for a bit.
759,2017-09-07T12:01:33.000287,Johana,i’ve been using brave. i really like it.
759,2017-09-07T12:07:31.000202,Bruno,cool. i havent used that one. i do like vivaldi but the lack of tab sync across devices is a no go for full time usage for me. for personal use at least
759,2017-09-07T12:14:13.000492,Johana,brave is more security oriented.

761,2017-09-07T12:52:46.000075,Adrian,"could someone help me with this python code? I’m trying to build my own tuple by looping through a list and adding them to the tuple, but something seems wrong and I can’t really figure why:

l = list(myTuple)

761,2017-09-07T13:00:17.000290,Mallie,"What does `widget.choices` look like in reality? You are modifying a list `l` but then you assign `myTuple` to `widget.choices`. Also know that `(myTuple)` won't make `myTuple` a tuple, if that is what you were thinking the paren would do in that case."
761,2017-09-07T13:01:23.000533,Glinda,Looks like you want a tuple of tuples.
761,2017-09-07T13:01:34.000216,Glinda,When you're better off using a list of namedtuple
761,2017-09-07T13:01:59.000369,Glinda,Or any other object that isn't tuple of tuple
761,2017-09-07T13:02:59.000172,Cassondra,Looks like your widget.choices is waiting a tuple of tuples…
761,2017-09-07T13:03:24.000497,Adrian,"well I just figured my mistake, I had to give widget.choices `l` instead of `myTuple`"

761,2017-09-07T13:07:56.000452,Margrett,`pd` being pandas in this scenario

761,2017-09-07T13:13:32.000002,Meg,"I mean, you can do conversion after import, but I don't think the `read_csv` options allow column name case change"
761,2017-09-07T13:14:19.000127,Meg,"I mean, ther eis a `converters` option, but that's just for you to apply functions to convert values in specific columns"
761,2017-09-07T13:14:38.000145,Glinda,<@Adrian> this way works really well if you need to keep your items intact.
761,2017-09-07T13:14:54.000705,Glinda,You can apply a lambda function for pandas on import
761,2017-09-07T13:16:35.000412,Glinda,<https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15799>

userows = [...]

` double = lambda x: x* 2` is equivalent to :

```def double(x):

761,2017-09-07T13:18:41.000028,Glinda,It's really amazing
761,2017-09-07T13:20:29.000331,Glinda,The reason it's better to use a named tuple is you can preserve your relationship between the first and second item. You don't have to worry about inserting in any order. You can also do things like create a dictionary of named tuples.
761,2017-09-07T13:21:20.000065,Mallie,"<@Adrian> and are you using this for a ChoiceField by chance? It doesn't _have_ to be a tuple I don't think, it just needs to be iterable, so `l` probably works as is"
761,2017-09-07T13:22:11.000002,Meg,"nice find, <@Glinda> :taco:"
761,2017-09-07T13:23:00.000259,Margrett,"Yes, thanks <@Glinda> :taco:"
761,2017-09-07T13:23:33.000654,Glinda,Even if it needs to end up being a tuple. It's better to keep it in an some related object until you need to raw tuple.
761,2017-09-07T13:24:52.000093,Glinda,"That way you can have it throw exceptions when you want do :

a, b = item.var1, item.var2  if it tries to unpack a None or wrong object you can catch that exception to prevent an error."
761,2017-09-07T13:25:40.000441,Glinda,Yeah I have lots of shitty experience with importing terrible pandas csv
761,2017-09-07T13:26:47.000626,Glinda,"csv with variable header location, first few rows with 1,2 columns and the header being at row 10, but row 11 has len(row_10) &lt; len(row_11) and you only want the data that's in that extra row."
761,2017-09-07T13:26:58.000401,Glinda,Because the developer didn't think naming that column was important.
761,2017-09-07T13:34:08.000188,Orpha,"i gave up on giving up, got rid of the orm stuff… made a list of tuples and insert ignored them"

761,2017-09-07T13:38:35.000574,Adrian,"Awesome, thaks for that, gonna look into it, sound definitely better what i used :stuck_out_tongue: <@Glinda> :taco:"
761,2017-09-07T13:40:54.000338,Adrian,yeah I used it for a choicefield that was created through a django widget
761,2017-09-07T13:45:12.000421,Claudine,hello I have a question
761,2017-09-07T13:52:42.000717,Margrett,"I ended up using this to fix my mixed case header lines:

764,2017-09-07T14:33:15.000630,Chasity,"Hello all. This is the very first time, I am trying something like this in Python. I need help. 
I am writing a script that reads from a csv file and gets only the headers and then I need to insert those headers into a table on SQL, but how do I define the datatypes ?
I can only read the header names from csv and not the datatype of each column."
764,2017-09-07T14:33:53.000171,Glinda,Are you using a python database orm?
764,2017-09-07T14:34:04.000379,Glinda,why do you need to define data type?
764,2017-09-07T14:34:50.000368,Chasity,I am trying to create ddl statement which would like create a new table on the sql using the columns I extracted from csv.
764,2017-09-07T14:35:03.000117,Chasity,How would I define the datatypes for those columns then ?
764,2017-09-07T14:35:29.000670,Chasity,"CREATE TABLE TABLE (
COLUMN_NAME DATATYPE(SIZE));"
764,2017-09-07T14:35:51.000624,Chasity,"As per that definition, I would like to define the datatype and size."
764,2017-09-07T14:35:59.000687,Glinda,"So if you are reading in csv, you are reading in a string."
764,2017-09-07T14:36:20.000228,Glinda,"you can represent other items (int, float, string, char, bool, etc) using strings."
764,2017-09-07T14:36:42.000060,Glinda,So you need a way of parsing in these values and giving the corresponding string the correct type.
764,2017-09-07T14:37:02.000035,Glinda,Can you give an example of a few columns in the header and what you know the data type of each to be?
764,2017-09-07T14:37:26.000175,Chasity,"Yea, so will I have to parse them manually, or are their any methods that are built in that would help me do it ?"
764,2017-09-07T14:40:11.000191,Glinda,it really depends on what you have
764,2017-09-07T14:40:27.000076,Glinda,If one row of data =
764,2017-09-07T14:40:27.000094,Chasity,Let me share the script I have written.
764,2017-09-07T14:40:53.000182,Glinda,"`True, 1.01, 2, hi, h`"
764,2017-09-07T14:41:03.000318,Glinda,That will be slightly easier
764,2017-09-07T14:49:07.000069,Glinda,What you have written is doing it correctly
764,2017-09-07T14:49:15.000389,Glinda,csv datatype = varchar
764,2017-09-07T14:49:23.000335,Glinda,or string
764,2017-09-07T14:49:52.000540,Glinda,csv is storing your data as a string
764,2017-09-07T14:50:07.000168,Glinda,can you paste an example of your header/ dattype
764,2017-09-07T14:50:33.000273,Chasity,Sure.
764,2017-09-07T14:52:45.000336,Glinda,"If this is a one time thing where you'll never read in this data again, you can make adictionary with the headerstring, in this dictionary you'll have 'head_string':'data_type' then you use that relate to your database entry."
764,2017-09-07T14:53:04.000241,Glinda,"If you do it very often with the same heads, then you can do the same as first option."
764,2017-09-07T14:53:16.000219,Glinda,If the heads are different and you need to inspect the actual data this is where it gets complicated.

765,2017-09-07T16:31:22.000165,Signe,that uses `.format` syntax

768,2017-09-07T22:59:40.000047,Beula,"<@Winnifred> It's just showing how they implement it, so the short is they store the ""partial application"" as attributes on the function object"

769,2017-09-08T00:23:03.000042,Virgen,is ```pymssql``` a better option than ```pyodbc```?
769,2017-09-08T00:23:39.000032,Virgen,how did you get pymssql to format like that?
769,2017-09-08T00:32:01.000007,Beula,"I don't think either is better, I just wanted to find a doc"
769,2017-09-08T00:48:13.000215,Virgen,"<@Beula> which do you use? And, out of curiosity, what db do you use? I'm pretty new to this, so I would rather spend my time learning on what most people use. I mean, if everyone uses pymssql, I don't want to waste my time with pyodbc."
769,2017-09-08T00:48:58.000010,Beula,I use postgres and psycopg2 usually

769,2017-09-08T06:27:37.000358,Rosalind,Hey guys
769,2017-09-08T06:28:18.000051,Rosalind,I do not understand how this for loop works no matter how hard I try to understand
769,2017-09-08T06:28:59.000140,Rosalind,"In layman term, what is the best explaination for this kinda for statement"
769,2017-09-08T06:29:25.000127,Sean,<@Rosalind> did you try to open it up to a 'normal' for loop?
769,2017-09-08T06:30:17.000026,Sean,"```
for word in WORD_TOKENS:
    if Word not in STOP_WORDS:
        yield Word
```

Hope this helps"
769,2017-09-08T06:30:29.000130,Rosalind,Is it the same thing??
769,2017-09-08T06:30:38.000069,Sean,yes
769,2017-09-08T06:31:09.000072,Sean,"but you can use the one liner to create an array variable, ex: ` NON_STOP_WORDS = [Word for Word in WORD_TOKENS if not Word in STOP_WORDS] `"
769,2017-09-08T06:31:20.000186,Rosalind,How do you actually break it down?
769,2017-09-08T06:31:24.000262,Fabiola,It's more like a yield than a return
769,2017-09-08T06:31:32.000118,Fabiola,but otherwise spot on
769,2017-09-08T06:31:39.000237,Sean,<@Fabiola> thanks
769,2017-09-08T06:32:59.000095,Sean,"<@Rosalind> you divide it in 3 parts: the _yielding_ part is the first `Word` , then you have the _loop_ `for Word in WORD_TOKENS` and lastly, you have the _condition_ `if not Word in STOP_WORDS`"
769,2017-09-08T06:33:17.000076,Rosalind,"Because sometimes, there are cases like (word in word_token if not in word_token etc etc"
769,2017-09-08T06:33:27.000099,Rosalind,Ohhh!
769,2017-09-08T06:33:49.000370,Rosalind,Word (Yield) for Word (for loop condition)
769,2017-09-08T06:33:54.000005,Rosalind,True??
769,2017-09-08T06:34:32.000085,Fabiola,`(yield) (for loop) (condition: if True then yield)` does that make sense?
769,2017-09-08T06:34:56.000001,Rosalind,"Oh man, this is so helpful ,thank you so much sensai!"
769,2017-09-08T06:36:07.000213,Fabiola,The regular case is `[x for for x in thing]`. Adding the conditional allows you to drop elements if you don't want them.
769,2017-09-08T06:36:25.000019,Rosalind,"I see, i see"
769,2017-09-08T06:36:46.000294,Sean,"yes, more often (I) use it without the condition"

Followed instructions: <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/flask-nginx-uwsgi-ubuntu-tutorial> . 502 on going to the domain and logs don't seem to say anything :neutral_face:
773,2017-09-08T10:28:41.000336,Junita,"so if you ssh to the server, can you see that your python application is listening?"
773,2017-09-08T10:28:57.000267,Sean,it's running as a service somewhere
773,2017-09-08T10:29:05.000215,Sean,i'm not that experienced with uwsgi/nginx
773,2017-09-08T10:29:07.000233,Junita,"or for example as they say in the guide, trying to go to port 5000, is it up?"
773,2017-09-08T10:29:14.000211,Beula,`lsof -i :&lt;port&gt;` if you are looking for a port
773,2017-09-08T10:29:52.000274,Beula,Or just `curl localhost:5000` to make sure your app is listening
773,2017-09-08T10:29:52.000631,Sean,5k doesn't work
773,2017-09-08T10:30:07.000020,Sean,i think the app crash(es)
773,2017-09-08T10:30:16.000368,Junita,is it logging anything?
773,2017-09-08T10:30:36.000377,Beula,"What if you try to run the commands manually, acting like the `.service` file?"
773,2017-09-08T10:32:27.000383,Sean,it sits waiting for confiuration

773,2017-09-08T10:33:22.000655,Beula,"So you are saying that your application itself is running, and it is `uWSGI` that isn't? If you aren't sure, start at the application, then step to uwsgi"
773,2017-09-08T10:34:06.000385,Sean,how can i verify if it's running? curling just gives connection refused
773,2017-09-08T10:34:14.000520,Sean,i don't know how uwsgi/nginx run the application
773,2017-09-08T10:35:41.000237,Beula,"You need to find the port your app should be listening on and try to reach it, are you sure you are trying the right port?"

773,2017-09-08T10:36:46.000393,Junita,Or specific to the guide you are following - did you get the “Hello There” (or whatever your app’s equivalent is before the section “Create the WSGI Entry Point”
773,2017-09-08T10:41:55.000665,Sean,yeah
773,2017-09-08T10:42:03.000563,Sean,"sorry for late response, had to ddouble check that"
773,2017-09-08T10:44:07.000530,Junita,"so you can reach it on the port  directly, outside of uwsgi then?"
773,2017-09-08T10:44:30.000380,Sean,"yeah, both of the 'tests' work"
773,2017-09-08T10:44:42.000356,Sean,`uwsgi --socket....` and `python foo.py`
773,2017-09-08T10:44:48.000774,Sean,afterwards `curl localhost:5000`
773,2017-09-08T10:45:32.000391,Junita,what’s in your ini file?
773,2017-09-08T10:46:43.000018,Sean,same as in the link
773,2017-09-08T10:48:15.000130,Junita,and the wsgi.py is in the same folder?
773,2017-09-08T10:48:27.000018,Sean,yes
773,2017-09-08T10:49:21.000353,Junita,are the paths in the .service file all correct?
773,2017-09-08T10:50:21.000237,Sean,"i actually had earlier an typo there which i fixed, don't know if this matters though"
773,2017-09-08T10:50:29.000264,Sean,double checking now
773,2017-09-08T10:52:28.000015,Sean,"yup, all correct"
773,2017-09-08T10:54:16.000275,Junita,and when running `sudo systemctl start myproject` you see no errors?
773,2017-09-08T10:54:49.000281,Sean,jup
773,2017-09-08T10:55:35.000577,Beula,Any errors printed in the syslog (`journalctl`)?
773,2017-09-08T10:55:55.000011,Sean,"`$ journalctl

773,2017-09-08T10:56:01.000181,Junita,"how does your `/etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject` look - is the socket file correct?  if you copy the path, can you see it?"
773,2017-09-08T10:57:18.000822,Sean,yup
773,2017-09-08T10:57:56.000654,Junita,and when doing `grep server_name /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/* -RiI` you see your server listed?
773,2017-09-08T11:01:21.000456,Sean,yup
773,2017-09-08T11:02:10.000203,Junita,and I’m guessing running the syntax error test returns no errors?
773,2017-09-08T11:02:18.000690,Junita,and running `sudo systemctl restart nginx` returns no errors?
773,2017-09-08T11:03:08.000594,Sean,both no errors
773,2017-09-08T11:04:02.000239,Sean,umm now it's saying it's running
773,2017-09-08T11:04:11.000364,Junita,it should be properly setup then.
773,2017-09-08T11:04:25.000621,Sean,`   Active: active (running) since Fri 2017-09-08 17:47:49 EEST; 15min ago`

773,2017-09-08T11:04:45.000345,Sean,cant connect
773,2017-09-08T11:04:55.000715,Sean,can i verify if i am blocking it somehow?
773,2017-09-08T11:04:59.000094,Junita,what do the permissions/ownership of the sock file look like?
773,2017-09-08T11:05:05.000711,Sean,i might be using some firewall or similar but i cant seem to remember what setup i have
773,2017-09-08T11:05:29.000422,Sean,`srw-rw----`
773,2017-09-08T11:05:34.000240,Junita,"no if you are getting the gateway error it’s connecting to nginx on your machine, it’s something about nginx routing to the uwsgi socket"
773,2017-09-08T11:05:41.000567,Junita,who owns it?
773,2017-09-08T11:05:47.000611,Sean,my username and www-data
773,2017-09-08T11:06:19.000287,Junita,"and your username is the one in here:

773,2017-09-08T11:06:43.000442,Sean,yes
773,2017-09-08T11:06:47.000065,Sean,exactly
773,2017-09-08T11:11:01.000047,Junita,what happens if in your ini file you change `chmod-socket = 664` and restart it?
773,2017-09-08T11:12:07.000728,Sean,which command for restart?
773,2017-09-08T11:13:00.000447,Junita,`sudo systemctl restart myproject`
773,2017-09-08T11:13:29.000343,Sean,no difference
773,2017-09-08T11:13:43.000032,Junita,what are the permissions on that socket file now?
773,2017-09-08T11:16:42.000473,Sean,`srw-rw-r--`
773,2017-09-08T11:18:16.000526,Junita,"hmm, in your service file, maybe try `ExecStart=/home/blizzard/myproject/myprojectenv/bin/uwsgi --ini myapp.ini --uid sammy --gid www-data`"
773,2017-09-08T11:18:52.000393,Junita,basically add your username to `--uid` and the `--gid www-data` - and you did add your user to the www-data group right?
773,2017-09-08T11:19:36.000288,Sean,"yea, but when i write `groups` it doesn't print out the `www-data` group ¿"
773,2017-09-08T11:21:03.000092,Junita,"okay, screw all this.  lets just make it run on a port.  lol"
773,2017-09-08T11:21:11.000431,Sean,:smile:
773,2017-09-08T11:21:33.000331,Sean,i hate uwsgi + nginx + python combo... i spent last time over 3 days (almost straight) getting it to work
773,2017-09-08T11:22:02.000378,Junita,"in the ini file, change `socket = myproject.sock` to `socket = 127.0.0.1:5000`"
773,2017-09-08T11:22:36.000505,Sean,just quickly - could you explain briefly the difference between sock and port?
773,2017-09-08T11:23:24.000710,Junita,"the port is just like you use connecting via the internet, sockets is a way for interprocess communication locally"
773,2017-09-08T11:24:12.000197,Junita,"in your nginx config, change `uwsgi_pass unix:/home/sammy/myproject/myproject.sock;` to `uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:5000;`"
773,2017-09-08T11:24:26.000180,Junita,now restart :allthethings:
773,2017-09-08T11:24:44.000342,Junita,first `sudo systemctl start myproject`
773,2017-09-08T11:24:56.000326,Junita,then `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
773,2017-09-08T11:25:06.000223,Sean,shouldnt i stop in between?
773,2017-09-08T11:25:09.000455,Sean,myproject
773,2017-09-08T11:25:17.000398,Junita,"oh, oops, yeah.  stop, or just restart should work"

775,2017-09-08T16:13:16.000215,Shirl,And how do i fix that :)?
776,2017-09-08T17:03:33.000444,Yesenia,"question on a debate i'm having. we have a bunch of API classes that all take the same `api_session` parameter. we're debating these two approaches to a factory-esque thing:
```
from someapi1 import Api1
from someapi2 import Api2

def get_api1(api_session):
    return api1(api_session)

def get_api1(api_session):
	return api2(api_session)
```
vs.:
```
from someapi1 import Api1
from someapi2 import Api2

def get_api(api_session, api_name):
    return return globals()[api_name](api_session)
```"
776,2017-09-08T17:03:59.000521,Yesenia,benefits of the first approach: don't have to remember the API names and intellisense-type completion works in IDEs
776,2017-09-08T17:04:14.000150,Yesenia,"benefits of the second: all you have to add is an import, no getters"
776,2017-09-08T17:05:40.000247,Ciera,why would you want a function that only init a class ?
776,2017-09-08T17:06:33.000441,Yesenia,"<@Ciera> so we don't have to import the APIs all individually, we can just import one ""importer"" and tell it what we want and it will find it"
776,2017-09-08T17:07:01.000097,Yesenia,"this is actually used in a fixture for pytest, so we avoid having to make a fixture for every API, just 1 one fixture that can import them all"
776,2017-09-08T17:08:56.000102,Ciera,I don't know a lot pytest but if you really need it I would say the first one. I'm not a fan of using `globals`
776,2017-09-08T17:09:15.000411,Yesenia,"me neither, and i hate breaking code completion"
776,2017-09-08T17:09:29.000303,Yesenia,"argument against me is ""no one should rely on code completion"" :confused:"
776,2017-09-08T17:09:37.000022,Ciera,or make an `if` statement for each `api_name`
776,2017-09-08T17:10:03.000331,Beula,"I am kind of with <@Ciera> though i don't love either, myself. In a rare case I have just had a function to init those kinds of things and auto discover them"
776,2017-09-08T17:10:11.000081,Beula,but that complexity is isolated elsewhere
776,2017-09-08T17:10:21.000183,Ciera,"```
def get_api(api_session, api):
  return api(api_session)
```"
776,2017-09-08T17:11:16.000028,Ciera,I would prefer something like that (doesn't really provide anything here but we could imagine there is other param
776,2017-09-08T17:11:34.000054,Ciera,but then you still need to import the api modules where you call the function
776,2017-09-08T17:11:41.000159,Yesenia,yeah the problem is `api` is what there are a lot of
776,2017-09-08T17:11:57.000359,Beula,Or a dict of mappings
776,2017-09-08T17:12:24.000173,Ciera,yeah a big if or a dict would be the best imo
776,2017-09-08T17:12:38.000082,Yesenia,example? not sure i follow
776,2017-09-08T17:12:39.000253,Beula,+1 - it's clearer and more explicit
776,2017-09-08T17:13:04.000133,Beula,"```
APIS = {
  'v1': ApiV1,
  'v2': ApiV2,
}

def get_api(name):
    return APIS[name]
```"
776,2017-09-08T17:13:27.000387,Beula,"This is all a bit abstract, so it still feels a little awkward - is this for flask?"
776,2017-09-08T17:13:55.000253,Yesenia,"i gotcha, yeah that seems just a different version of #2"
776,2017-09-08T17:14:17.000329,Yesenia,but actually does save a little bit
776,2017-09-08T17:14:42.000044,Yesenia,also i think this method still breaks code completion
776,2017-09-08T17:15:13.000197,Beula,"It probably does, what is the `api` classes?"
776,2017-09-08T17:15:19.000310,Beula,You can use type-hinting if you are on new python :smile:
776,2017-09-08T17:15:27.000028,Beula,`apiv1: ApiV1 = get_api('v1')`
776,2017-09-08T17:15:41.000286,Yesenia,<@Beula> `api` classes hold the methods for that particular API
776,2017-09-08T17:15:42.000277,Beula,wow I am struggling
776,2017-09-08T17:15:45.000420,Yesenia,they are broken up by function
776,2017-09-08T17:15:53.000024,Beula,are you a client or server?
776,2017-09-08T17:15:57.000238,Yesenia,client
776,2017-09-08T17:16:32.000247,Beula,"Oh, in that case I wouldn't likely do that at all and would much prefer to explicitly grab what I want if I need to know the name of the thing to get..."
776,2017-09-08T17:16:43.000459,Beula,You aren't really abstracting anything with that factory - so it doesn't really provide value
776,2017-09-08T17:16:55.000024,Beverley,yes let me push this there
776,2017-09-08T17:17:37.000014,Yesenia,"<@Beula> it allows us to be able to instantiate all APIs from one place, which for testing is nice"
776,2017-09-08T17:17:43.000041,Yesenia,otherwise we need a fixture for every single API
776,2017-09-08T17:17:50.000110,Beula,So?
776,2017-09-08T17:17:55.000394,Beula,explicit &gt; implicit
776,2017-09-08T17:17:59.000384,Yesenia,well that's the problem we're solving
776,2017-09-08T17:18:09.000260,Yesenia,"right, i agree, but not everyone does"
776,2017-09-08T17:18:15.000388,Yesenia,some people favor code tidyness
776,2017-09-08T17:18:25.000140,Beula,"No, they are preferring ""terseness"""
776,2017-09-08T17:18:54.000161,Yesenia,everyone has an opinion ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
776,2017-09-08T17:18:56.000200,Beula,"sometimes I just implement something to show the concrete way, gives less time to bike shed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
776,2017-09-08T17:19:29.000518,Yesenia,"actually, the dict mapping does *not* break code completion somehow..."
776,2017-09-08T17:19:33.000045,Yesenia,interesting

781,2017-09-09T15:00:18.000149,Sean,`sudo netstat -peanut` doesn't even show usage of the port 5k
781,2017-09-09T15:00:26.000048,Sean,should i try to go back to the sock usage?
781,2017-09-09T15:01:00.000128,Ciera,if the curl to the port work it should be fine
781,2017-09-09T15:01:17.000019,Sean,what do you mean
781,2017-09-09T15:02:13.000039,Ciera,you said connecting to the port works ?
781,2017-09-09T15:02:29.000021,Sean,"yes, if i run it manually"
781,2017-09-09T15:02:40.000034,Sean,should i keep it running manually? is what i meant
781,2017-09-09T15:03:06.000019,Sean,_is there a big difference between socks and ports?_
781,2017-09-09T15:04:21.000007,Ciera,yeah keep it running manually for now :slightly_smiling_face:
781,2017-09-09T15:04:26.000030,Sean,i got it working o_O
781,2017-09-09T15:04:37.000063,Ciera,no not a big difference
781,2017-09-09T15:04:48.000020,Ciera,sockets are usually a bit faster I believe
781,2017-09-09T15:05:08.000089,Sean,"i got it working using sock somehow, but there's no ssl now"
781,2017-09-09T15:06:11.000022,Ciera,to have ssl you need nginx to listen on 80 and redirect to 433 and listen on 433
781,2017-09-09T15:06:16.000032,Ciera,you can do that like this
781,2017-09-09T15:06:29.000063,Sean,is there a default config for this?
781,2017-09-09T15:07:24.000091,Sean,"thank you, let me try it out"
781,2017-09-09T15:07:41.000057,Ciera,obviously you need to adapt a bit :slightly_smiling_face:
781,2017-09-09T15:08:07.000009,Sean,yeah
781,2017-09-09T15:10:45.000066,Sean,"okay, cool, progressing. now i get ""Your connection is not private"" error from Chrome, and if I enable cloudflare I receive 502"
781,2017-09-09T15:12:06.000029,Ciera,oh yeah I'm not sure you to set up all that with cloudfare
781,2017-09-09T15:13:28.000067,Sean,thank you so much for your time :tada::unicorn_face:
782,2017-09-10T00:10:51.000006,Gary,I've searched for hours with no luck. What is the best way to deal with MySQl escaped strings. I'm somewhat new to Python and this has me stuck. I know i could do a regex but I'm hoping there is a standard method for this. It uses SqlAlchemy
782,2017-09-10T00:11:38.000039,Gary,"I come from a PHP background where we use stripslashes, this might lend a hand to the thinking pattern I have"
782,2017-09-10T04:09:39.000021,Gary,"ok, i will look into that then. Thank you elliot"
783,2017-09-10T03:54:00.000043,Dominque,"I believe SQLAlchemy should handle it for you as long as you declare a mapping and use the ""?"" to pass in parameters into your query string"
784,2017-09-10T08:37:06.000029,Moon,hello guys
784,2017-09-10T08:37:18.000045,Moon,I am newbie to python

784,2017-09-10T08:43:41.000004,Moon,Windows
784,2017-09-10T08:44:07.000060,Romelia,ShareX
784,2017-09-10T09:08:55.000031,Suellen,<@Romelia> ShareX has a Python binding?
784,2017-09-10T09:14:28.000060,Dominque,Doing research for an article and I want some alternative opinions
784,2017-09-10T09:22:41.000002,Romelia,I honestly don't know <@Suellen>
785,2017-09-10T09:14:17.000024,Dominque,"Quick question guys, what is everyone's preferred means of environment configuration handling?"
785,2017-09-10T09:43:01.000034,Junita,<@Dominque> like for your local development machine or something else?
786,2017-09-10T09:51:30.000022,Christin,"Hello, 
I'm trying to run this condition `int(np.sign(weights.T.dot(points))) != y` however I've been getting this error for a while and can't seem to debug. I'm new to Python and Numpy. Here's the error: `ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.`

Code: <https://gist.github.com/hallaksec/99ab4d6a6da93ed9ff991a5e3315a291>"
786,2017-09-10T09:59:59.000104,Gabriele,"Probably best to break it down into individual steps so that you can see from the error line number exactly where the problem lies. e.g.:
```
dot = weights.T.dot(points)
sign = np.sign(dot)
int_sign = int(sign)
if int_sign != y:
    # etc
```"
786,2017-09-10T10:03:12.000098,Christin,<@Gabriele> I can tell that its `np.sign(weights.T.dot(points))`
786,2017-09-10T10:04:38.000049,Gabriele,"but is it the np.sign call, or the weights.T.dot call?"
786,2017-09-10T10:05:16.000008,Christin,Its the .dot
786,2017-09-10T10:06:30.000023,Christin,"Here's a sample:
```weights = [[ 0.  0.  0.]]
points =  [(array([ 1.        , -0.18592399, -0.14921323]), 1), (array([ 1.        ,  0.63754454,  0.36669891]), 1)]
```"
786,2017-09-10T10:11:12.000062,Junita,is it expected that the elements in points are arrays?  how was that constructed?  do you know the expected dimensions?
786,2017-09-10T10:12:20.000072,Christin,"<@Junita> i constructed points using this function:
```def generate_data(self, N):        
        print(""[+] Generating Data.."")
        data = []
        for i in range(N):
            x, y = [np.random.uniform(-1, 1) for i in range(2)]
            points = np.array([1,x,y])
            data.append((points, int(np.sign(self.V.T.dot(points)))))
        return data```"
786,2017-09-10T10:13:54.000001,Junita,so points is the return value of `generate_data`?
786,2017-09-10T10:14:16.000039,Christin,Yup
786,2017-09-10T10:14:27.000036,Christin,Full code here <https://gist.github.com/hallaksec/99ab4d6a6da93ed9ff991a5e3315a291>
786,2017-09-10T10:16:30.000079,Junita,"so, take this with a grain of salt as I’m a numpy noob myself - but I think the issue here is that you are trying to use a multidimensional array here instead of a numpy matrix"
786,2017-09-10T10:18:26.000039,Christin,"If I replace np.array with np.matrix `shapes (3,) and (1,3) not aligned: 3 (dim 0) != 1 (dim 0)`"
786,2017-09-10T10:18:46.000042,Christin,So I guess my vector V is now the problem but I replaced the np.array with np.matrix as well which yields `only length-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars`
786,2017-09-10T10:24:22.000037,Junita,"so, you can give a shape to `np.random.uniform`"
786,2017-09-10T10:25:14.000015,Junita,"although I’m not 100% following what you are trying to do - but yeah, I think trying to construct it the way you are is at fault"
786,2017-09-10T10:26:30.000056,Junita,"also, I seem to recall a tip of avoiding rank 1 arrays like that, where it’s better to use a vector (i.e. something of shape (n, 1) vs (n,)"
786,2017-09-10T10:37:44.000029,Christin,Can't seem to find any solution :confused: <@Junita> <@Gabriele>
787,2017-09-10T10:39:14.000028,Gabriele,What does the whole traceback look like?
787,2017-09-10T10:42:26.000035,Christin,"<@Gabriele> ```Traceback (most recent call last):

787,2017-09-10T10:44:00.000026,Gabriele,"Not as helpful as I'd hoped. I think you just have to make sure that `points` is the same shape and size as `weights.T`. You might want to print both those values out to see what they are, and try and use that information to make the necessary adjustments"
788,2017-09-10T11:59:53.000079,Betsy,"I have a `pytest` dilemma. I have a a `conftest.py` that's gotten to be pretty huge, since it contains a lot of fixtures (around 1500) lines. I know I can have several `conftest` files but I kinda like having all my fixtures bundled together. Ideas anyone? "
788,2017-09-10T12:59:32.000031,Betsy,I guess that makes sense
789,2017-09-10T12:24:51.000086,Beula,"Sounds like you know the options, I personally nest my test folders and Cascade the fixtures down, and only ""promote"" them to a higher level when they're needed "

792,2017-09-10T18:07:47.000001,Martha,Hi all - looking for any recommendations on streaming a 3GB csv - fortunately im going to reduce the columns to maybe 3-5 at most but its a good size - possibly 10s of millions of rows
792,2017-09-10T18:09:13.000122,Meg,AWS S3?
792,2017-09-10T18:09:31.000069,Meg,for storage
792,2017-09-10T18:09:44.000030,Meg,or do you mean some sort of streaming addition to a server?
792,2017-09-10T18:10:23.000014,Martha,no I have it locally - we are importing our next batch of contacts - and thats all set up - but im doing a side analysis for our product manager - its techinically only text processing - but im doing it locally and giving him back a list of all the crappy contacts - I have a class I wrote that I use allt he time that determies likely relation between an entity and a url
792,2017-09-10T18:11:20.000022,Meg,"ok, by streaming, do you mean chunking with `csv`?"
792,2017-09-10T18:11:41.000062,Martha,yeah - i just want to read in the data and write it back out after running it through one function - i just dont want to read it all into memory
792,2017-09-10T18:14:36.000066,Meg,hmm.  hmm

792,2017-09-10T18:17:15.000068,Martha,thanks im looking thru it
792,2017-09-10T18:23:33.000040,Betsy,"using the `csv` module you can iterate over a `Reader` object which is a generator, so you won't load it all into memory"
792,2017-09-10T18:24:14.000020,Betsy,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader>
792,2017-09-10T18:24:56.000011,Martha,what is a good way to measure/test whether or not its properly running (e.g. using or not using a bunch of memory)
792,2017-09-10T18:25:13.000084,Beula,"Yep, +1 for the csv.reader:

```
import csv

with open('massive_file.txt') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    headers = next(reader)
    for row in reader:
        pass

792,2017-09-10T18:25:27.000047,Beula,"you can do `free -m` on a posix machine (linux, mac)"
792,2017-09-10T18:25:33.000020,Betsy,If your machine didn't crash then it's probably fine :grimacing: 
792,2017-09-10T18:25:44.000013,Martha,lol id like to not crash my computer :slightly_smiling_face:
792,2017-09-10T18:25:59.000006,Beula,it shouldn't since you only have a row at a time
792,2017-09-10T18:26:29.000011,Betsy,Are you familiar with the concept of generators in python? 
792,2017-09-10T18:26:51.000026,Martha,kind of - I havent really used them much yet tbh -i would likely use them for csvs but  i usually throw all my massive csv into gocsv
792,2017-09-10T18:27:01.000026,Betsy,"Or more accurately, an iterator "
792,2017-09-10T18:27:52.000097,Betsy,"Well, the whole concept of an iterator object is that it doesn't hold the data structure in memory, but iterates over the elements per requests, yielding the relevant part "
792,2017-09-10T18:28:29.000028,Betsy,"In case of the csv module, that means that only one line is read into memory each time, and released when the next one is called "
792,2017-09-10T18:28:40.000076,Martha,thats exactly what I want
792,2017-09-10T18:29:12.000134,Betsy,Hence the recommendation :wink: 
792,2017-09-10T18:29:18.000042,Martha,thanks :slightly_smiling_face:

792,2017-09-10T18:30:10.000096,Martha,yeah i saw a few answers on so about pandas
792,2017-09-10T18:30:23.000063,Martha,"but i dont use it much, ive found other workaround sometimes suit better at times"

792,2017-09-10T19:01:06.000012,Martha,I have one that I usually use the csv with haha so I was trying to add the part of that which I like
792,2017-09-10T19:01:10.000067,Betsy,Well for off you can use `DictReader`that will return a nice dict object per row 
792,2017-09-10T19:01:19.000092,Betsy,Ah gotcha 
792,2017-09-10T19:01:42.000040,Martha,basically i want it to write to file in real time - so i can preview results as it is building if needed (which I do a lot)
792,2017-09-10T19:01:47.000070,Martha,thats the only requirement really for me
792,2017-09-10T19:02:16.000043,Betsy,Not sure what you mean by real time... 
792,2017-09-10T19:02:30.000060,Martha,im prob mixing two concepts together - i imagine thats whats wrong here lol

793,2017-09-10T23:07:54.000154,Kati,I have a problem when trying to use .update on a dict from a json file
793,2017-09-10T23:08:33.000189,Kati,It seems to disregard the dict from the json file and replace it with the dict I want to append
793,2017-09-10T23:09:36.000024,Marcie,<@Kati> use the `+` button to add a code snippet with the code you're having an issue with
793,2017-09-10T23:10:50.000101,Kati,"It's a bit messy after all the experimenting, but I'll make a clean example and upload it, 2 sec"
793,2017-09-10T23:27:51.000130,Marcie,"<@Kati> I get back:
```In [14]: a = Example()
{u'posted': {'new_value': {}}}```"
793,2017-09-10T23:28:01.000072,Marcie,which is the expected behaviour
793,2017-09-10T23:28:18.000027,Marcie,are you expecting something different?
793,2017-09-10T23:28:50.000008,Kati,I want it to append the new value to the already existing dict from the json file
793,2017-09-10T23:31:05.000030,Kati,"like this 
```{
  ""posted"": {

793,2017-09-10T23:33:23.000066,Marcie,"so `update` is not a deep update, it only does one level of keys, so that entire `posted` key is getting updated with the one from your new json"
793,2017-09-10T23:33:39.000104,Marcie,"if you want to update a key inside the dict, just call update on that key's dict"

794,2017-09-11T02:07:39.000094,Niki,hi
794,2017-09-11T02:08:03.000043,Niki,i’m having trouble in finding out what encryption this is
794,2017-09-11T02:08:08.000031,Niki,BAGfxzupdBepIrhfNxeDoQ==
794,2017-09-11T02:08:13.000201,Niki,could someone help me?
794,2017-09-11T02:10:18.000074,Collette,<@Niki> could be anything. Can you provide more details?
794,2017-09-11T02:11:02.000017,Niki,of course. It is supposed to be an encrypted e-mail
794,2017-09-11T02:12:06.000027,Collette,"Anyone can send anything via an e-mail, that's just text"
794,2017-09-11T02:12:39.000111,Niki,"i mean, is like a encrypted e-mail address"
794,2017-09-11T02:12:46.000101,Niki,<mailto:foobar@gmail.com|foobar@gmail.com> for example
794,2017-09-11T02:13:32.000101,Collette,"e-mail address is just text, it doesn't differ much from ""foobarbuz"""
794,2017-09-11T02:14:09.000012,Collette,"It really could be anything, unless you know _something_; i.e. which program have been used to encrypt that string"
794,2017-09-11T02:14:29.000123,Niki,that is what i want to find out
794,2017-09-11T02:14:37.000177,Niki,i dont need to know the original string
794,2017-09-11T02:14:46.000169,Collette,You can't. It doesn't work like that.
794,2017-09-11T02:15:07.000176,Niki,"i need to know if it is md5, base64, sha256.."
794,2017-09-11T02:15:37.000034,Collette,These aren't encryption algorithms. These are hashing algorithms.
794,2017-09-11T02:16:54.000063,Niki,ok
794,2017-09-11T02:17:12.000136,Niki,"so, is there how to discover which hashing algorightm?"
794,2017-09-11T02:18:37.000007,Collette,"Only by hand. You should learn about all these algorithms, how they form a hash and why base64 is actually not a hashing algorithm"
794,2017-09-11T02:19:16.000139,Collette,"I can tell that it looks like a base64-encoded string, although the decoding doesn't give me anything remotely useful"
794,2017-09-11T02:21:29.000115,Niki,ok. I will do that
794,2017-09-11T02:21:43.000095,Niki,"but it is definitely not md5, right?"
794,2017-09-11T02:22:19.000077,Collette,"Yes. md5 is a hex string, it cannot contain letters except for a-f"
794,2017-09-11T02:25:04.000254,Niki,alright
794,2017-09-11T02:25:11.000154,Niki,thanks you very much

798,2017-09-11T12:13:23.000698,Beula,I always defer that to something like consul
798,2017-09-11T12:13:25.000342,Bruno,do you use anything now?
798,2017-09-11T12:13:35.000182,Beula,"Or you can do distributed locks with redis, I believe "

800,2017-09-11T12:46:04.000650,Otha,has anyone here has class variables revert to their previous value after being assigned in a method?
800,2017-09-11T12:47:05.000142,Beula,"<@Otha> Negative, can you provide a minimal example to show this happening?"
800,2017-09-11T12:47:27.000105,Otha,"yep , just sketching one up now"
800,2017-09-11T12:47:38.000085,Junita,"any threading going on, or shared memory?"
800,2017-09-11T12:47:50.000411,Junita,but yeah - minimal example is key
800,2017-09-11T12:48:04.000572,Meg,<@Otha> only instance is when a property setter was resetting other class properties inside
800,2017-09-11T12:49:09.000401,Meg,"eg 

```    @value.setter
     def value(self, val):
           self.some_property = val ** 2
           self.value = val

      self.myvar1 = '8765'


def make_my_thing():
  set_myvar1('some_input')```"
800,2017-09-11T12:49:41.000084,Otha,in pycharm I can see `myvar1` = ’12345
800,2017-09-11T12:49:51.000014,Otha,when I call make_my_thing
800,2017-09-11T12:50:00.000350,Beula,"You are using class variables, not instance variables there"
800,2017-09-11T12:50:07.000429,Meg,yup
800,2017-09-11T12:50:08.000303,Otha,"but as soon as I exit the method, its reverted to None"
800,2017-09-11T12:50:09.000195,Beula,e.g. shared across all objects
800,2017-09-11T12:50:21.000230,Meg,append `self` to `myvar`
800,2017-09-11T12:50:30.000537,Meg,eg `self.myvar1` and refer to that in the setter
800,2017-09-11T12:50:41.000220,Otha,I have ?
800,2017-09-11T12:50:53.000125,Beula,"```
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.myvar1 = None

800,2017-09-11T12:50:56.000579,Beula,That is what you need
800,2017-09-11T12:51:00.000688,Beula,Set it on the _instance_
800,2017-09-11T12:51:07.000412,Beula,And then use properties for the set/get logic
800,2017-09-11T12:51:08.000282,Otha,oh I follow
800,2017-09-11T12:51:23.000167,Otha,"been a long day, not sure how I missed that one :confused:"
800,2017-09-11T12:51:28.000227,Meg,don't forget to use `self` too
800,2017-09-11T12:51:36.000117,Meg,when accessing the properties
800,2017-09-11T12:51:39.000353,Otha,"having said that, I want ALL instances of my class to have these defaults"
800,2017-09-11T12:51:50.000085,Meg,"one of my first brain farts with python, coming from java :slightly_smiling_face:"
800,2017-09-11T12:51:58.000431,Otha,buyt I suppose the __init__ will do that
800,2017-09-11T12:52:02.000720,Beula,"```
class MyClass
    def __init__(self):
        self._myvar1 = None

        self._myvar1 = value * pi  # or whatever
```"
800,2017-09-11T12:52:23.000712,Otha,do I need to decorate the setters ?
800,2017-09-11T12:52:27.000655,Otha,never had to do that before?
800,2017-09-11T12:53:00.000418,Beula,"In python it's not idiomatic to use ""set_value"" and ""get_value"" as it would be in Java"
800,2017-09-11T12:53:07.000204,Beula,Properties are what you do that for
800,2017-09-11T12:53:29.000480,Otha,so why are some of my class variables changing as I require them too
800,2017-09-11T12:53:34.000419,Otha,and others reverting to default?
800,2017-09-11T12:53:54.000067,Beula,That is a bit weird
800,2017-09-11T12:53:54.000079,Meg,basically `self` == `this`
800,2017-09-11T12:54:14.000718,Beula,You example doesn't actually work
800,2017-09-11T12:54:15.000301,Otha,weird is what I’ve got too
800,2017-09-11T12:54:24.000611,Beula,So I think you need to re-try it or edit it
800,2017-09-11T12:54:27.000437,Otha,example was a very quick hack and slash
800,2017-09-11T12:54:35.000379,Otha,let me get some real code
800,2017-09-11T12:54:44.000473,Beula,We need to see one that we could run locally and repeat the error
800,2017-09-11T12:58:47.000700,Otha,I think I might of seen the error of my ways
800,2017-09-11T12:58:52.000325,Otha,"I have a method, calling a method"
800,2017-09-11T12:58:54.000436,Otha,in the same class
800,2017-09-11T13:00:15.000365,Otha,"yep, thats solved it"
800,2017-09-11T13:00:30.000579,Otha,"trying to set self.brand = xxx in a method, which was itself called by a method"
800,2017-09-11T13:00:54.000457,Otha,"if I return a value from the second method, then do self.brand = returned_answer"
800,2017-09-11T13:00:58.000674,Otha,the value sitcks
800,2017-09-11T13:01:04.000179,Otha,never run in to that one before
800,2017-09-11T13:02:34.000598,Otha,"ah, I can see the full error now"
800,2017-09-11T13:02:39.000455,Otha,inherited code
800,2017-09-11T13:02:57.000325,Otha,I was doing self.brand = self.make_brand()
800,2017-09-11T13:02:58.000713,Otha,and
800,2017-09-11T13:03:17.000040,Otha,make_brand() would assign the answer to self.band
800,2017-09-11T13:03:23.000163,Otha,and have no return
800,2017-09-11T13:03:25.000281,Otha,ergo None
800,2017-09-11T13:03:31.000543,Otha,so self.band = None
800,2017-09-11T13:03:40.000142,Otha,time to go home I think
800,2017-09-11T13:03:48.000444,Otha,thankyou all for your help :slightly_smiling_face:
800,2017-09-11T13:04:23.000329,Meg,we were just rubber ducks for your debugging :slightly_smiling_face:
800,2017-09-11T13:08:42.000044,Otha,I really should invest in a small yellow duck for my desk
800,2017-09-11T13:08:57.000019,Otha,can tell the other programmer in the office is away this week!
800,2017-09-11T13:26:49.000711,Long,I got a dolphin. Helps with stress too.
800,2017-09-11T15:50:50.000100,Kiersten,"<@Otha> Why settle for a normal yellow duck when you can have so much more
<https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/08/8e/7b/3f/amsterdam-duck-store.jpg>"
801,2017-09-11T16:10:24.000067,Mirian,"<@Beverley> If I remember this correctly, it depends on the name of the module"
801,2017-09-11T16:10:59.000053,Mirian,so it looks for `celery_app.py` in `revamp` module
801,2017-09-11T16:11:40.000507,Beverley,"that's the funny part I created revamp but "".celery_app"" isn't on either as far as I can tell"
801,2017-09-11T16:12:50.000307,Mirian,"ok, and if you try just `celery worker --app revamp`?"

801,2017-09-11T16:16:26.000481,Mirian,"oh, tbh it looks fine to me, maybe it's something wrong with the project structure or virtualenv?"
801,2017-09-11T16:16:49.000320,Mirian,(just throwing ideas)
801,2017-09-11T16:17:24.000110,Beverley,noted will see if I can figure out why
801,2017-09-11T16:17:43.000422,Mirian,sometimes old `.pyc` files are messing things up

801,2017-09-11T16:18:31.000210,Beverley,don't think it's .pyc since I can get it to work on an example project
801,2017-09-11T16:20:05.000128,Mallie,<@Beverley> Are you in the `revamp` module? The module needs to be on your path so it won't look a directory up. If `revamp/` is in `code/` you should do `celery worker --app revamp.celery_app` in `code/`
801,2017-09-11T16:21:10.000114,Beverley,yes working in the module
801,2017-09-11T16:22:12.000318,Beverley,in the same dir with manage.py for django project
801,2017-09-11T16:22:56.000057,Mallie,Oh so revamp is also the name of the project? Gotcha. What are the contents of the 'revamp' module?
801,2017-09-11T16:23:21.000647,Mallie,That should contain your `celery_app`?
801,2017-09-11T16:23:59.000322,Beverley,what i have is in gallery.colorfest this code
801,2017-09-11T16:26:33.000242,Beverley,"how I got it this creates a celery worker revamp, I only mimick "".celery_app"" since it was the last command an example project i'm porting over. if I try "".full_render"" I get a missing module error"
801,2017-09-11T16:41:23.000208,Mallie,"Hm I'm not sure, you're mentioning several module names here and I don't know what they look like. Basically the `--app` flag expects to be given a module on python path that has a Celery app config"
801,2017-09-11T16:41:48.000427,Mallie,So you need to make sure that the path exists as a python module if you pass it to `--app`
801,2017-09-11T16:44:40.000399,Mallie,"You don't want to give `--app` ""full_render"" since that is a task - when you are running a worker it is going to hang out and wait to receive registered tasks for the app, but you don't instantiate it with a task"
801,2017-09-11T16:49:59.000373,Beverley,"short explanation for this there's channels and sockets supposed to run a background process and return status in between &amp; final result, working with another dev on this, did ask him about it..."

803,2017-09-11T21:01:43.000131,Beula,<@Charlena> why regex for this? Seems like you could use the csv module with the right delimiter
803,2017-09-11T21:01:53.000028,Beula,Then some basic replaces
803,2017-09-11T21:02:22.000268,Beula,Where are you stuck?
803,2017-09-11T21:05:10.000025,Lorna,... or just explode (<http://php.net/manual/en/function.explode.php>) it.
803,2017-09-11T21:22:35.000024,Charlena,<@Beula> I look into those options guys
803,2017-09-11T21:33:08.000020,Beula,I think you may be in the wrong slack group for that.

804,2017-09-11T23:35:44.000129,Martha,you can also wrap the final in `print(' '.join(data))` to have it come out as `R. Lukaku 5`

813,2017-09-12T08:05:59.000117,Vada,"Ok, with the async model you'll iterate once to add all the hashing tasks to the pool and then wait for them to finish before doing the later lookup"
813,2017-09-12T08:06:34.000218,Vada,Adding to the pool is basically instantaneous. It's the waiting for all the tasks to finish that will take some time

814,2017-09-12T08:52:29.000423,Gwenda,"```
import requests
def make_soup(url):
     response = requests.get(url)
     soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text)

make_soup(""<http://google.co.uk>"")
```"
814,2017-09-12T08:54:32.000264,Gwenda,Is it relevant to want to assert that make_soup called `requests.get` with the correct url ? or should I pass requests as a dependency ?
814,2017-09-12T08:54:39.000550,Gwenda,Not really sure how to tackle this
814,2017-09-12T08:54:46.000242,Gwenda,thanks in advance !
814,2017-09-12T08:58:25.000164,Ciera,to make sure `request.get` is called with the correct `url` you should mock request for this test
814,2017-09-12T08:58:49.000202,Luana,I think this package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests-mock> may help
814,2017-09-12T08:58:50.000381,Fabiola,I use the excellent responses library for mocking requests: <https://github.com/getsentry/responses>
814,2017-09-12T09:01:22.000141,Gwenda,Nice !! thank you very much <@Fabiola> <@Luana> <@Ciera> !
814,2017-09-12T09:01:42.000127,Gwenda,I suppose the same approach would apply to DB insertions ?
814,2017-09-12T09:02:05.000391,Luana,definitely
814,2017-09-12T09:02:31.000408,Beula,"I prefer `pook` myself, no need to specifically mock any lib but it mocks the network layer"
814,2017-09-12T09:02:44.000266,Beula,<https://pook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>
814,2017-09-12T09:03:16.000128,Beula,"You can basically:

```
@pook.get('<https://myurl>')
def test_my_url():
    my_lib_function()
    assert pook.isdone()
```"
814,2017-09-12T09:03:30.000532,Beula,It has a load of matchers you can use with it
814,2017-09-12T09:04:26.000631,Gabriele,Are people writing separate functional tests for the APIs at all?
814,2017-09-12T09:05:01.000178,Beula,"Doesn't that typically depend if the API provides you a ""sandbox"" or demo env?"
814,2017-09-12T09:05:39.000017,Gabriele,You tell me. :slightly_smiling_face:  This is not an area I work in much. The APIs I use are public ones and I've not encountered that sort of functionality.
814,2017-09-12T09:06:06.000346,Beula,"Generally speaking, I don't if I don't have a testing env for them due to rate limits and such"
814,2017-09-12T09:06:39.000316,Beula,I mock all the major response cases so I know if I can handle the error conditions around their API - generally speaking most places are decent about not breaking existing APIs
814,2017-09-12T09:06:44.000339,Beula,"Assuming their devs are decent, anyway"
814,2017-09-12T09:07:03.000421,Fabiola,The people I'm working on this with have made some functional tests. I don't know if it's necessary: <https://github.com/keboola/sapi-python-client/tree/master/tests>
814,2017-09-12T09:07:27.000196,Gabriele,"One of the APIs I use is the Nominatim endpoint... it's barely documented and the source code is spaghetti PHP, so I have little confidence in it :smile:"
814,2017-09-12T09:07:57.000075,Meg,"oh, that's a fun one to use"
814,2017-09-12T09:08:13.000156,Meg,especially when the rate limiting doc says 'depends'
814,2017-09-12T09:08:19.000328,Meg,with no hard limits
814,2017-09-12T09:09:53.000405,Gabriele,"yup. Unfortunately I refuse to use Google Maps/Places, and Factual are discontinuing their Javascript API in favour of an app that semi-secretly tracks their users, so my options for a public places database are very limited"
814,2017-09-12T09:13:11.000354,Meg,"they are very committed to open source, and were very prominent at FOSS4G last month"
814,2017-09-12T09:13:25.000505,Meg,"with the main dev for Leaflet, Vlad, giving three talks"
814,2017-09-12T09:15:55.000268,Gabriele,Doesn't look like they have a places database
814,2017-09-12T09:21:51.000584,Meg,"oh, thought you meant geocoding"
815,2017-09-12T09:00:31.000114,Fabiola,"I haven't used the library recommended by <@Luana> so I can't compare, but the key thing is to mock one way or another. Without mocking, you're not testing your code so much as testing the API / website itself. It makes your tests fragile and slow to run, as network problems will make your tests fail etc."
816,2017-09-12T09:12:17.000339,Meg,what about mapbox?
817,2017-09-12T10:31:13.000524,Fabiola,Mapzen? <https://whosonfirst.mapzen.com/> Also seem to be big proponents of oss
817,2017-09-12T10:34:45.000555,Gabriele,Looks like it has potential. If only their docs weren't written by a frustrated English Literature graduate
817,2017-09-12T10:38:26.000747,Gabriele,"I mean, I'm trying to browse it to find out what it actually offers, and I come across a page detailing the Chicken response format: <https://mapzen.com/documentation/wof/formats/#chicken>"
817,2017-09-12T10:39:05.000037,Cristy,every api should have chicken format
817,2017-09-12T10:39:36.000502,Gabriele,I'll add it to my backlog
817,2017-09-12T12:19:59.000141,Gabriele,"Your example is a bit too abstract for me to understand what exactly it would be used for, but these days it's common to prefer composition to inheritance, certainly"
817,2017-09-12T12:20:25.000552,Gabriele,It's not like Python makes it easy to enforce the interfaces anyway
817,2017-09-12T12:21:34.000439,Beula,"<@Gabriele> check out abc, you can enforce interfaces (e.g. when trying to instantiate a class from an ABC, abstract base class, you'll get an error if any abstract methods are not overridden)"
817,2017-09-12T12:25:19.000818,Gabriele,Starts to feel a bit like Java then :wink:
817,2017-09-12T12:28:43.000302,Mary,<@Gabriele> - what about testability? Classes become harder to test because of composition
817,2017-09-12T12:29:01.000341,Mary,The only way I could think of making it easier is passing the class as a param on initialization
817,2017-09-12T12:29:19.000339,Gabriele,Why? Mixins are just composition that the compiler does for you.
817,2017-09-12T12:30:13.000442,Gabriele,"I guess you can't easily pass several different composed types to the same tests, but if you really want the same interface across them, you can add that"
817,2017-09-12T12:30:25.000513,Beula,Mixins aren't composition
817,2017-09-12T12:30:37.000610,Beula,"You can write them as such, but it's still a  ""is-a"" relationship there"
817,2017-09-12T12:30:41.000302,Gabriele,Composition is more about aggregating functionality than about interfaces
817,2017-09-12T12:31:38.000273,Gabriele,"Well, I'm thinking on a more abstract level. It's still just taking the bits from one thing and inserting them into another. Is-A and Has-A becomes rather fluid in a dynamically typed language anyway"
817,2017-09-12T12:32:10.000178,Beula,"Not really, inheritance is always ""is-a"""
817,2017-09-12T12:32:19.000293,Beula,Dynamic doesn't really impact that at all
817,2017-09-12T12:33:40.000256,Gabriele,"But you can have ""is-a"" without inheritance, and you can have mixins with all 'private' members which don't really give you any sort of useful 'is-a' relationship."
817,2017-09-12T12:34:12.000445,Gabriele,"As I see it, the only really important thing is, ""does this object support this interface?"""
817,2017-09-12T12:34:30.000166,Beula,It's not about whether or not you get anything useful from it though
817,2017-09-12T12:34:40.000292,Beula,"And you are right, that _can_ happen"
817,2017-09-12T12:34:59.000491,Beula,But that's digressing from mixin not really being composition
817,2017-09-12T12:37:06.000706,Gabriele,I still think it's just a matter of perspective.
817,2017-09-12T12:37:56.000356,Beula,Far enough :slightly_smiling_face:
817,2017-09-12T12:40:19.000646,Mary,"For Python specifically, I'd define the difference between Mixin and Composition classes in this way:
```
#Mixin
class Mixin(object):
    def do_something(self):
        print 'Hi'

class BaseClass(Mixin):
    def run(self):
        self.do_something()

#Composition
class Composition(object):
    def do_something(self):
        print 'Hi'

class BaseClass(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.composition = Composition()

    def run(self):
        self.composition.do_something()
```"
817,2017-09-12T12:40:54.000435,Gabriele,Sure
817,2017-09-12T12:41:14.000205,Beula,"<@Gabriele> Is right, a mixin is meant as a type of composition, it really depends on how the mixin class is written"
817,2017-09-12T12:49:43.000627,Beula,<@Tameika> Are the Deep Learning models populating a database or something? Or are you wanting to trigger the py2 models from the flask app?
817,2017-09-12T12:56:53.000157,Meg,<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/multi-db/>
817,2017-09-12T12:57:48.000036,Meg,<https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ>
818,2017-09-12T12:14:05.000228,Mary,"hey guys, I've been thinking about whether I should use a Mixin or Class Composition. In my scenario, I have a cross cutting concern that I would like to share across a few classes. For concreteness, lets say the class looks like the following: 
```
class CrossCuttingMixin(object):

    def initialize(self, service, external_id):
        pass

    def is_enabled(self, payload):
        pass

    def is_id_allowed(self, id):
        pass
```
1. Is it better to write a mixin or use class composition (i.e. initialize the class within another class)
2. Should mixins should keep state or be stateless?
3. Any good reads on this debate?"
819,2017-09-12T12:48:31.000728,Tameika,"say, we have a Deep Learning model written in python2.x and the next step is to deploy it as a web service. Is it okay, if the Flask REST APIs are in Python3.x"
819,2017-09-12T12:48:53.000169,Tameika,How do me maintain the parity?
819,2017-09-12T12:50:39.000435,Tameika,"True, they should all trigger py2 models as well libraries installed for py2.x"
819,2017-09-12T12:52:24.000194,Beula,"How are you ""triggering"" the deep learning models?"

819,2017-09-12T12:59:56.000008,Beula,<@Cherrie> How does it not fix the problem? You need to load the config from the environment if you can't store it in settings.py
819,2017-09-12T13:00:30.000521,Cherrie,<@Beula> is there a way to leverage another settings file?
819,2017-09-12T13:00:50.000264,Cherrie,"like a ""databases"" only setting file"
819,2017-09-12T13:00:54.000059,Meg,eg `dev_settings.py`
819,2017-09-12T13:01:08.000089,Cherrie,sure
819,2017-09-12T13:01:57.000417,Beula,"Sure, set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE='other.settings.file'`"
819,2017-09-12T13:02:05.000111,Beula,And in that other file extend your base

819,2017-09-12T13:02:35.000513,Beula,But we also use the environment
819,2017-09-12T13:03:25.000216,Cherrie,"I tried to move the second db connection to the dev_settings.py, but it seems to overwrite the test_settings which means my tests try to run using a real connection as opposed to a test connection.  I suppose the real conflict is between test_settings and original settings and where to put the second database connection"
819,2017-09-12T13:04:33.000027,Beula,"I guess I am not following you, take a peek at the link above - we have three different settings files (dev/test/prod) that all extend a _base"
819,2017-09-12T13:04:51.000447,Beula,each adds its customization
819,2017-09-12T13:08:45.000107,Cherrie,"<@Beula> sure, for your example, when you run your project you're selecting which settings module to run via the command line, right?"
819,2017-09-12T13:10:08.000379,Beula,"We override the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` envvar: the manage.py sets the default to ""development"", testing uses pytest-django (which sets it to testing), and in prod we set the envvar explicitly"

823,2017-09-12T21:30:36.000055,Marcie,"<@Charlena> there's no state sharing between lambda executions, you need to use an external store for state"
823,2017-09-12T21:35:39.000100,Lorna,<@Charlena> so you want data to persist between Lambda calls?
823,2017-09-12T21:57:20.000087,Charlena,<@Lorna> no I'm not that deep and into stuff like persistence yet. But I made a simple lambda function and the normal python way seems to be working.

825,2017-09-13T02:38:21.000033,Eustolia,i am did it
825,2017-09-13T02:38:23.000072,Bruno,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import json

&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = '{""1018.2"": [0, 0], ""1009.2"": [1, 1]}'

&gt;&gt;&gt; type(foo)
&lt;class 'str'&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; data = json.loads(foo)

&gt;&gt;&gt; data
{'1018.2': [0, 0], '1009.2': [1, 1]}

825,2017-09-13T02:38:35.000111,Bruno,<@Eustolia> ^^ proper way
825,2017-09-13T02:38:54.000092,Eustolia,im get code from this answer <https://stackoverflow.com/a/18178379/6108054>
825,2017-09-13T02:39:08.000088,Bruno,dont use eval
825,2017-09-13T02:39:27.000079,Bruno,"if its a well formatted json, use `json.loads()`"
825,2017-09-13T02:39:28.000116,Ciera,<@Collette> actually it could be argued that it's one of the goal of `__repr__`. <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__>
825,2017-09-13T02:39:39.000087,Ciera,"&gt; Called by the repr() built-in function to compute the “official” string representation of an object. If at all possible, this should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same value (given an appropriate environment). If this is not possible, a string of the form &lt;...some useful description...&gt; should be returned."
825,2017-09-13T02:40:05.000157,Bruno,<@Eustolia> ok wait. i see
825,2017-09-13T03:39:22.000227,Collette,"<@Ciera> I've digged cpython hg repo in order to find the fact that this documentation section was added _before_ introducing `pickle` module... but I failed. Apparently `pickle` has been added in cpython v1.2, and there were no such section in the docs at the time."
825,2017-09-13T03:40:15.000023,Collette,I think this is a bug in the docs - nobody should ever try to recreate an object using its `repr`
825,2017-09-13T03:40:35.000087,Ciera,<@Collette> :taco: for the research
825,2017-09-13T03:40:56.000118,Ciera,Yeah I wouldn't do it either. I was also quite surprise when I saw that in the doc
825,2017-09-13T03:47:27.000129,Junita,which part of that doesn’t seem to be working?
825,2017-09-13T03:47:50.000186,Junita,oh.  oops.  slack fail.  that was in response to something that was apparently said forever ago.  weird
825,2017-09-13T03:50:14.000191,Collette,<@Ciera> that section was added between v1.3 and v1.5.2 - I can't be more specific because for some reason v1.3 &lt; cpython &lt; v1.5.2 has reference documentation in ms doc format instead of LaTeX :smile:
825,2017-09-13T03:51:12.000031,Ciera,must find who did that :smile:
826,2017-09-13T05:25:54.000036,Gillian,Can anyone help me optimize a function I have written? It really slows down when processing large 'length' values. (function in thread)
826,2017-09-13T05:26:17.000425,Gillian,"```
def answer(start, length):

    #Ex start=0,length=3, iterable_line == [0,1,2]
    iterable_line = map(lambda x: x+start, list(range(length)))

    final_checksum = []

    while len(iterable_line) &gt; 0:
        #performs XOR on each item in iterable_line, yielding a single value
        checksum = reduce(lambda x,y: (int(bin(x),2)^int(bin(y),2)), iterable_line)

        #that value is appended to final_checksum
        final_checksum.append(checksum)

    #returns the XOR of captured values from all 'lines', a single int.
    return reduce(lambda x,y: (int(bin(x),2)^int(bin(y),2)), final_checksum)

#To clarify, I am looking to capture the values to the left of the forward slash:

```"
826,2017-09-13T05:29:12.000087,Ciera,I'm not entirely sure I understand what you are trying to do
826,2017-09-13T05:29:22.000338,Ciera,but it all looks unpythonic to me
826,2017-09-13T05:29:34.000144,Ciera,so there should be a way to optimize that :slightly_smiling_face:
826,2017-09-13T05:29:47.000249,Gillian,"Ok, I can try to explain what I'm aiming for"
826,2017-09-13T05:30:26.000241,Gillian,"the function returns a checksum of all captured numbers, using XOR"
826,2017-09-13T05:30:35.000160,Ciera,the best is to find something useful for you. Maybe some thing you do everyday that you can automate ?
826,2017-09-13T05:31:56.000403,Gillian,"I'm looking for a more efficient way to capture the values I want. 

Currently generating a list, then trimming the list down one element at a time, really slows it down at larger values"
826,2017-09-13T05:32:02.000137,Felicita,Yea that was what I was thinking but I don't know the limitations of what Python can do. For example one project idea I had in mind was creating an auto deploy system for my job but I'm not sure if Python is able to move files through ftp
826,2017-09-13T05:32:19.000215,Ciera,"all captured number being 0, 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,12 ?"
826,2017-09-13T05:32:44.000321,Gillian,"yes, all elements from the first line, then 1 element less, per line"
826,2017-09-13T05:32:48.000146,Ciera,"&gt;  I don't know the limitations of what Python can do
Python can do everything :wink:"
826,2017-09-13T05:34:02.000192,Felicita,As so I hear. Do you personally know how to go about that? I just need help with that part and I think I'll be good
826,2017-09-13T05:34:43.000270,Junita,There’s a module for FTP: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html>
826,2017-09-13T05:34:53.000188,Junita,tools like fabric are useful though for automating tasks like that
826,2017-09-13T05:35:55.000111,Gillian,"I added the visual example because it seems to form a pattern, I'm looking to ignore: multiples of length &lt; ignore &lt; multiples of length -1 , but I can't figure out how to write a function for that"
826,2017-09-13T05:36:40.000328,Felicita,Ah nice I think this is what I was looking for. Going to read more on this. Thanks man!
826,2017-09-13T05:36:43.000234,Gillian,other lengths follow the same pattern as well
826,2017-09-13T05:36:54.000190,Ciera,"`range(start, stop)` could be useful for that"
826,2017-09-13T05:37:24.000105,Ciera,start being the start of the line and stop (start + length - x)
826,2017-09-13T05:37:36.000319,Ciera,incrementing x by one for each line
826,2017-09-13T05:37:38.000026,Junita,np.
826,2017-09-13T05:38:17.000093,Gillian,"do you think that will be more efficient than list manipulation? I think it will, but I'm still learning"
826,2017-09-13T05:45:11.000189,Ciera,"```
length = 4
start = 0
minus = 0

for _ in range(length):
  for x in range(start, start + length - minus):
    print(x)
  minus += 1
  start = x + minus
```"
826,2017-09-13T05:45:49.000093,Ciera,something like this will get you a list of the captured number
826,2017-09-13T05:46:36.000216,Gillian,"nice, can you tell me why you used the underscore in `for _ in` ? that's the second time I've seen that"
826,2017-09-13T05:47:21.000098,Ciera,"in fact it can even be ```
length = 4
start = 0

for minus in range(length):
  for x in range(start, start + length - minus):
    print(x)
  minus += 1
  start = x + minus
```"
826,2017-09-13T05:47:43.000243,Ciera,`_` is a convention when you don't need to use the value
826,2017-09-13T05:47:58.000182,Gillian,"I see, so I'm just iterating over the values"
826,2017-09-13T05:48:16.000321,Gillian,"Thanks for the help by the way, I really appreciate it"
826,2017-09-13T05:48:42.000018,Ciera,no problem. Do you understand how the code works ?
826,2017-09-13T05:49:02.000259,Gillian,"the first one I understand for sure, the second one is similar but I'll need a second look"
826,2017-09-13T05:49:04.000388,Ciera,don't hesitate to put some more print in there to exactly see how everything interact
826,2017-09-13T05:49:23.000290,Gillian,yeah I'm going to test the code here in a moment
826,2017-09-13T05:49:30.000020,Gillian,but it makes sense
826,2017-09-13T05:49:46.000224,Ciera,and Python come with a lot of good tools in it and it's always better to use those than create lambda and stuff :slightly_smiling_face:
826,2017-09-13T05:50:07.000138,Gillian,this is actually the third or so iteration of the function I've made
826,2017-09-13T05:50:24.000072,Gillian,"It's for a puzzle, but my submissions keep timing out"
826,2017-09-13T05:50:27.000252,Ciera,it's by coding that you learn :wink:
826,2017-09-13T05:50:33.000022,Gillian,"yeah, I love it"
826,2017-09-13T05:50:50.000244,Gillian,so I'm trying to optimize it a bit more

830,2017-09-13T07:29:01.000063,Gillian,the only reason I can think of is because of the nested 'for' loops
830,2017-09-13T07:32:29.000126,Ciera,"I'm not exaclty sure hwat this does `reduce((lambda x,y: (int(bin(x),2)^int(bin(y),2))), (imap(lambda x: x+start, gen_raw(length)))) `"
830,2017-09-13T07:32:40.000070,Ciera,maybe there is a better solution for that part
830,2017-09-13T07:35:38.000185,Gillian,reduce takes a function and an iterable and performs the function on the iterables until only one remains
830,2017-09-13T07:36:25.000284,Gillian,"int(bin(x),2)^int(bin(y),2) is performing XOR on the binary representations of x and y"
830,2017-09-13T07:36:48.000207,Gillian,"and the iterable is the second part, in two parts"
830,2017-09-13T07:37:22.000216,Gillian,imap(lambda x: x+start is adding the value 'start' to each element of gen_raw(length)
830,2017-09-13T07:37:33.000119,Gillian,gen_raw(length) performs the function you helped me with earlier
830,2017-09-13T07:37:55.000101,Ciera,I'm not sure you need to do something like that
830,2017-09-13T07:38:16.000045,Gillian,perhaps I'm overthinking it
830,2017-09-13T07:38:16.000144,Ciera,you shouldn't really need to define a function either
830,2017-09-13T07:38:48.000056,Gillian,maybe I focused too much on cramming a bunch of stuff on that one line
830,2017-09-13T07:38:58.000134,Ciera,can you explain what are x and y ?
830,2017-09-13T07:39:42.000054,Gillian,"x,y: is taking the first two different values generated from the iterator"
830,2017-09-13T07:39:51.000113,Gillian,which it then turns into one value
830,2017-09-13T07:40:23.000146,Gillian,"then when another is generated, it reduces that, compared with the previous value"
830,2017-09-13T07:40:24.000250,Ciera,ok got it
830,2017-09-13T07:40:46.000322,Ciera,are you sure this is the way to calculate it ?
830,2017-09-13T07:40:56.000135,Gillian,to be honest there might be easier ways
830,2017-09-13T07:41:33.000149,Gillian,"I didn't even know about XOR binary before this problem, like I understand the concept, but this method is what I came up with by putting a couple stackoverflow answers together"
830,2017-09-13T07:42:00.000224,Gillian,so it's possible the delay is taking place there
830,2017-09-13T07:42:27.000122,Ciera,I'm not at all familiar with this stuff so idk
830,2017-09-13T07:42:27.000131,Gillian,but I couldn't find an easier way to do xor on two ints than by doing that
830,2017-09-13T07:42:32.000078,Gillian,"sure, no worries"
830,2017-09-13T07:42:54.000259,Gillian,"it's a weird problem, I have 24 hours left to solve it"

(ii) When a user clicks on one of the Category bars, show all of the subcategories on the same screen
(iii) When a user clicks on one of the subcategories bars, show the tags under the subcategory.

````
Find the least common ancestor between two nodes on a binary search tree.

The least common ancestor is the farthest node from the root that is an ancestor

of both nodes. For example, the root is a common ancestor of all nodes on the

tree, but if both nodes are descendents of the root's left child, then that left

child might be the lowest common ancestor. You can assume that both nodes are in

the tree, and the tree itself adheres to all BST properties. The function

definition should look like question4(T, r, n1, n2), where Tis the tree

represented as a matrix, where the index of the list is equal to the integer

stored in that node and a 1 represents a child node, r is a non-negative integer

representing the root, and n1 and n2 are non-negative integers representing the

two nodes in no particular order. For example, one test case might be ...

question4([[0, 1, 0, 0, 0],

833,2017-09-13T11:47:59.000437,Mavis,"Hi! 
I've stated using SQLAlchemy in my new project and can not exactly get the relationships part.
I have a method which goes over a list of `Candidate` objects, its model has ` applications = relationship('Application', backref='candidate', )` and in that loop I want to merge the Candidate objects to different session. Problem is that it only merges the `Candidates` not the `Application` objects to the other session. I have a feeling that there is a setting that I'm missing either on the merge or model side that would enable saving all of the related models."
834,2017-09-13T13:05:20.000311,Floy,"Hello all!
why I do have this error here:
b = map(sum,a)

```"
834,2017-09-13T13:05:42.000353,Frieda,`sum` expects an iterable of numbers to add together
834,2017-09-13T13:05:54.000517,Frieda,`map` iterates over each thing in an iterable and applies a function to it

834,2017-09-13T13:08:14.000072,Floy,sum is not used the right way
834,2017-09-13T13:09:13.000298,Frieda,if you just need to add up the list of numbers `sum(a)` will do exactly what you want
834,2017-09-13T13:09:32.000395,Frieda,"there's not really any way to use `map` to add a list of numbers. `reduce` could do it, but there's no reason to since `sum` exists"
834,2017-09-13T13:11:07.000634,Floy,I some slick way to sum up two dimensional list :slightly_smiling_face:
834,2017-09-13T13:11:21.000105,Floy,other than : `b = sum([sum(x) for x in a])`

`
Soin me eyes, this should now work"
843,2017-09-14T05:35:49.000207,Carri,"yes, diff will be of type `datetime.timedelta`"
843,2017-09-14T05:35:53.000234,Gabriele,"If obj.accepted_date is in the right type, yes"
843,2017-09-14T05:36:05.000114,Carri,for code blocks use triple backticks with no spaces on either side of the code block
843,2017-09-14T05:36:42.000058,Robbin,`unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'datetime.datetime' and 'datetime.date'`
843,2017-09-14T05:37:24.000041,Gabriele,One of those types needs to change
843,2017-09-14T05:37:27.000002,Gabriele,You can decide which
843,2017-09-14T05:37:55.000032,Carri,`today = datetime.datetime.utcnow()` as your accepted date is a `datetime` object and not a `date` object
843,2017-09-14T05:39:04.000142,Robbin,"```    def get_accepted_date(self, obj):
        today = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
        accepted_date = obj.accepted_date
        diff = accepted_date - today
        return diff```

is giving me `can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`"
843,2017-09-14T05:39:15.000421,Carri,"and then your diff you're returning, if all you want is the number of days difference, you can `return diff.days`"
843,2017-09-14T05:39:32.000241,Carri,"ah, then change the `.utcnow()` to `.now()`"
843,2017-09-14T05:39:47.000239,Gabriele,"ugh, Python UTC handling is a bit broken, unfortunately. I'd suggest using utcnow everywhere, if you can"
843,2017-09-14T05:40:36.000275,Robbin,"Still getting the same error,

843,2017-09-14T05:40:53.000360,Carri,"yeah, ^ agree with that. in general UTC should be preferred for storage. if you need to render date/times in a locale specific TZ, that should be done on the presentation layer"
843,2017-09-14T05:41:32.000126,Carri,`accepted_date = obj.accepted_date.replace(tzinfo=None)` to remove the TZ Info
843,2017-09-14T05:41:35.000376,Robbin,thanks for this btw guys
843,2017-09-14T05:42:04.000117,Gabriele,I believe that both .now() and .utcnow() are offset-naive in Python (even though that is clearly incorrect for UTC). You will need to make sure that obj.accepted_date created in the same way
843,2017-09-14T05:42:41.000095,Robbin,<@Carri> after adding that line i get a new error `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'replace'`

843,2017-09-14T05:43:05.000261,Robbin,is this telling my the accepted_date is a type of none?

847,2017-09-14T08:52:24.000517,Hyun,Some info: I am a mathematician i am workin as Full stack .NET Developer but i have studied python only for data science so i have no main things in developing in python so could you tell me some main similarities in C# and Python?? cuz the differences are plenty?? As far as the OOP have the same technical mentality?
847,2017-09-14T08:54:07.000420,Meg,"well, OOP basics are the same regardless of language"
847,2017-09-14T08:54:19.000083,Meg,jsut Python doesn’t have interfaces
847,2017-09-14T08:54:37.000605,Meg,but there are alot of differences
847,2017-09-14T08:55:35.000604,Latarsha,"and supports multiple inheritance, while C# does not"
847,2017-09-14T08:55:37.000189,Meg,not a whole lot of overlap
847,2017-09-14T08:56:55.000145,Hyun,C#8 is gonna change to multiple inheritance and it gonna have MI and that was my worst nightmare no MI. But Python so versatile and thats what i love
847,2017-09-14T08:58:13.000295,Hyun,I want slowly to do besides my work python projects from scratch in OOP so i wanted to know if its easy (OOP is the same as you said) . Cuz its easier for someone who doesnt know OOP to start OOP in a new language rather than one who knows from some other language as far as i am concerned :smile:

848,2017-09-14T09:49:58.000335,Ciera,I think I would create a class method for `Reseller` and `Customer`
848,2017-09-14T09:50:28.000174,Ciera,something like `Reseller.get_unique(id_)` that check into a dict if the id exist

849,2017-09-14T10:34:03.000425,Meghan,<@Georgetta> What do you mean?
850,2017-09-14T12:57:48.000610,Felicita,quick question. How do you convert a string to a date and then substract dates from each other
850,2017-09-14T12:58:13.000145,Felicita,so 2/2/17 - 2/7/17 will give me 5 days
850,2017-09-14T12:58:38.000428,Mallie,"<@Felicita> Don't convert it to a string to do any sort of math, you do that with the datetime/date struct"
850,2017-09-14T12:58:44.000507,Mallie,Convert it to string just for presentation
850,2017-09-14T12:58:45.000283,Johana,"timedelta and datetime.strptime(‘Jun 1 2005  1:33PM’, ‘%b %d %Y %I:%M%p’)"
850,2017-09-14T12:59:17.000079,Johana,i think he’s going from string to datetime obj
850,2017-09-14T12:59:27.000398,Mallie,"Oh woops I had it backwards, you're right"
850,2017-09-14T13:00:08.000218,Johana,i’ve provided some tips. try those out and come back with what you have tried :wink:.
850,2017-09-14T13:00:25.000525,Felicita,<@Mallie> <@Johana> Yea I needed to convert it to date because I'm getting the date from the front end as strings
850,2017-09-14T13:01:16.000250,Felicita,<@Johana> yup will give it a shot thanks
850,2017-09-14T13:02:19.000123,Felicita,"end_date = datetime.strptime(‘Jun 1 2005  1:33PM’, ‘%b %d %Y %I:%M%p’)

SyntaxError: invalid character in identifier"
850,2017-09-14T13:02:37.000372,Felicita,Are there supposed to be spaces?
850,2017-09-14T13:02:50.000396,Johana,you may need to adjust your import statement of datetime.
850,2017-09-14T13:03:06.000350,Johana,`from datetime import datetime`
850,2017-09-14T13:03:09.000399,Johana,something like that
850,2017-09-14T13:03:33.000460,Gabriele,"Invalid character in identifier... did you copy and paste that line, perhaps?"
850,2017-09-14T13:04:11.000063,Johana,actually you don’t need timedelta either. i have some code here where i compare dates. i’m not formatting from a string but it shows the general idea: <https://github.com/openstax/research-p3-experiment-4/blob/master/digital_logic/experiment/service.py#L298-L311>
850,2017-09-14T13:04:15.000579,Felicita,yea I imported it <@Johana>
850,2017-09-14T13:04:48.000181,Felicita,<@Gabriele> yea I copied it straight. But then I tried typing it
850,2017-09-14T13:05:08.000443,Gabriele,"The error just looks like maybe you copied a character that doesn't work in Python, that's all"
850,2017-09-14T13:05:34.000499,Johana,"yea, i got an error on the quotes."
850,2017-09-14T13:05:38.000720,Johana,i’ll adjust it
850,2017-09-14T13:05:45.000041,Felicita,<@Johana> Are those date types?
850,2017-09-14T13:06:12.000274,Felicita,"<@Gabriele> Yea probably, let me try type it manually"
850,2017-09-14T13:06:56.000711,Johana,it’s the quotes for some reason they are jacked up.
850,2017-09-14T13:07:52.000121,Felicita,just your right it was the quotes just as I finished typing it out too lol <@Johana>
850,2017-09-14T13:07:59.000343,Johana,and yes those are datetimes.
850,2017-09-14T13:08:16.000723,Johana,sqlalchemy takes the datetime field from the database and converts it to a python datetime obj.
850,2017-09-14T13:09:48.000236,Felicita,the dates actually subtract without any conversions. I just need to convert the result into a readable date now

851,2017-09-14T13:54:29.000562,Johana,there are some books out there that try to cover the standard lib.
851,2017-09-14T13:54:38.000328,Johana,i think there is one called standard lib by example or something like that.
851,2017-09-14T13:55:08.000246,Johana,reading source code from many projects helps you learn those things too.
851,2017-09-14T13:55:25.000296,Frieda,the standard lib is _huge_ so it's really hard to cover the whole thing
851,2017-09-14T13:55:41.000178,Johana,yea that’s why they hit the mostly used ones like collections.
851,2017-09-14T13:55:45.000503,Johana,and itertools

853,2017-09-15T05:31:00.000238,Colene,"Hello! I'd love some help with a mock.patch issue I am having. I am using Django/DRF to run some integration tests. My test is using the http client to make a request to the DRF API. I use service classes inside my API viewset functions to do the bulk of the logic, e.g. I might have a test method that uses `mock.patch('internalapi.views.users.UserService', autospec=True)` to mock the UserService class used by the API and this works great. What I am unable to do however is mock the `SMSService` that the `UserService` uses internally. I cannot come up with a `mock.patch` target string that mocks that class. I've tried `mock.patch('internalapi.views.users.UserService.SMSService', autospec=True)` but of course `UserService` is a class not a module. I've also tried `mock.patch('internalapi.views.users.UserService.login.SMSService', autospec=True)` to target a class function but that also is not doing it. Is this possible - I want the `UserService` code to run during my test but not the `SMSService`."
853,2017-09-15T05:39:57.000382,Colene,"OK, so actually I was able to do this with a direct patch to `mock.patch('core.services.user_service.SMSService', autospec=True)`"

856,2017-09-15T13:03:59.000054,Mallie,Pretty sure but I'll check for confirmation...
856,2017-09-15T13:04:49.000296,Mallie,<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/>

856,2017-09-15T13:07:42.000122,Mallie,Ah so read the PEP a little more and this comparison is actually a little more informative to the point even
856,2017-09-15T13:07:52.000560,Mallie,"```with EXPR as VAR:
    BLOCK```"
856,2017-09-15T13:07:56.000511,Mallie,is equivalent to
856,2017-09-15T13:08:05.000360,Mallie,"```mgr = (EXPR)
exit = type(mgr).__exit__  # Not calling it yet
value = type(mgr).__enter__(mgr)
exc = True
try:
    try:
        VAR = value  # Only if ""as VAR"" is present
        BLOCK
    except:

        exc = False
        if not exit(mgr, *sys.exc_info()):

856,2017-09-15T13:08:16.000583,Mallie,So the cleanup is basically a `finally`

858,2017-09-15T15:38:21.000034,Orpha,ah ok
858,2017-09-15T15:38:58.000041,Orpha,"yea, that just really depends on how you are using it, the stripe IRC can probably help you a lot more"
858,2017-09-15T15:39:39.000330,Huey,"yeah I'm talking to a guy in there right now. He seems to think what I've got now is good enough. I mean, it works, I'm just nervous about releasing it to the wild because, you know, it's peoples' credit cards lol"
858,2017-09-15T15:39:56.000052,Huey,I'm afraid I'm gonna zig where I should have zagged and accidentally charge all my customers $1000 LOL
858,2017-09-15T15:42:18.000238,Orpha,"yea, you for sure dont want to store credit cards"
858,2017-09-15T15:42:42.000255,Orpha,"stripe can tokenize payment methods, thats probably what you want to use if you can"
858,2017-09-15T15:43:03.000232,Huey,"oh I am, I'm way past that point lol"
858,2017-09-15T15:43:47.000032,Huey,"I'm not worried about releasing credit card info, it's never touching my servers. I'm only concerned I'm not using stripe properly and am going to accidentally double bill someone, provide a refund wrong, or something along those lines"
858,2017-09-15T15:44:04.000245,Huey,"or not handle an error properly and Charge a customer without giving them access to stuff via my database, etc"
858,2017-09-15T15:44:16.000045,Huey,"just trying to consider all the possible ways this could go wrong, haha"
858,2017-09-15T15:44:34.000067,Orpha,"ah gotcha, thats more your app code then… just gotta test it over and over and over and make sure you only call things when they need to be called"
858,2017-09-15T15:51:37.000380,Huey,yeah
858,2017-09-15T15:51:53.000366,Huey,it's my app code and also my DB design
858,2017-09-15T15:52:38.000584,Huey,"I just feel like I should be keeping some sort of a history in my database in terms of charges, invoices, etc"
858,2017-09-15T15:53:00.000354,Huey,"currently I'm not, and it works fine, but I feel like there might be a time down the road when this design will shaft me lol"
858,2017-09-15T15:53:34.000639,Orpha,"yea, you should keep track of transactions"
858,2017-09-15T15:53:45.000028,Orpha,who paid what when
858,2017-09-15T15:54:22.000288,Orpha,or who was paid what when
858,2017-09-15T15:54:30.000214,Orpha,depending on the direction of money flow
858,2017-09-15T15:55:52.000289,Orpha,"there are many ways to do that too… basically, it’s a log of what you need or want to track… with any log, the more information you log, the better, because who knows when you need xyz"
858,2017-09-15T15:56:24.000091,Huey,true true!
858,2017-09-15T15:56:29.000592,Huey,I mean it's logged within Stripe
858,2017-09-15T15:56:39.000181,Orpha,"but its still a log, so dont stress about it, you should at minimum track the who was paid what when stuff"
858,2017-09-15T15:56:55.000618,Orpha,"yea, you should keep your own log too though"
858,2017-09-15T15:57:25.000550,Huey,"But the reason I ask is when customers change plans the easiest way for me to do it was to have them cancel their current subscription and sign up for a different one, rather than use the stripe upgrade/downgrade stuff and deal with changing billing cycles etc"
858,2017-09-15T15:57:38.000127,Orpha,"maybe your system things someone got paid, and stripe doesnt show a refund… this is why you also need a log"
858,2017-09-15T15:57:39.000151,Huey,so when I do that and delete the customer to start fresh it wipes their billing history.
858,2017-09-15T15:57:50.000133,Huey,"ok, cool"
858,2017-09-15T15:58:10.000312,Huey,I will probably create a payment history table for each user then
858,2017-09-15T15:58:32.000043,Orpha,"ah, you should for sure use stripes (or your own) upgrade/downgrade"
858,2017-09-15T15:58:41.000266,Orpha,dont let users cancel then signup again
858,2017-09-15T15:58:48.000310,Orpha,you will likely lose people that way
858,2017-09-15T15:59:18.000191,Huey,"well, then I will need to undo everything I just did, lol"
858,2017-09-15T15:59:21.000643,Orpha,lol
858,2017-09-15T15:59:35.000189,Orpha,"i mean, its your app.. so you can do what you want"
858,2017-09-15T15:59:43.000050,Huey,"It takes about 2 seconds to switch though, I couldn't see people really having an issue with that"
858,2017-09-15T15:59:46.000137,Orpha,just doesnt sound like the best UX
858,2017-09-15T15:59:59.000095,Orpha,im no expert though
858,2017-09-15T16:00:02.000481,Orpha,so yea haha
858,2017-09-15T16:00:39.000062,Orpha,do you have a subscriptions table?
858,2017-09-15T16:01:31.000258,Orpha,could you not just ‘on upgrade’ switch the users subscription_id to whatever they changed to
858,2017-09-15T16:01:54.000123,Orpha,then in transactions log you can also store what subscription they were on at the time of the transaction
858,2017-09-15T16:02:19.000605,Huey,Yeah I could do that. I might ... this was just the fastest/easiest way I could think to get it working
858,2017-09-15T16:02:30.000400,Orpha,for sure
858,2017-09-16T04:47:29.000065,Cristy,"traditionally, this is done by having one list of transactions, and the expenses having a negative value, this way you can just sum one list, it also makes several other common operations much simpler"
859,2017-09-15T21:17:55.000014,Latarsha,"hey guys, is this a good way to sum properties of objects contained in two different arrays?

```
expenses = [Expense(""pizza"", 50), Expense(""Rock Concert"", 100)]

I'm generating some live MIDI signals, and found that if I use `thread.start(); thread.join();`, the thread becomes blocking and I lose realtime functionality.
Alternatively, if I only use `thead.start()`, without `thread.join()`, the realtime functionality acts as expected.

Are there any potential issues with starting a thread and never joining it?
Is joining an optional thing for when you _want_ a thread to be blocking, or is its usage required in some way?"
862,2017-09-16T22:43:50.000039,Mallie,"<@Libby> I have not used the `threading` module much but I can't see anything in the doc to imply that `thread.join()` is is anyway a necessary operation. The thread terminates when `run()` returns, you shouldn't have to do more than ensure there isn't an infinite loop somewhere in there to ""clean up"" the thread part of things. You definitely shouldn't _have_ to force another thread to wait for it with `join()`."
863,2017-09-17T03:15:59.000034,Catheryn,"I have a maybe dumb question about the sortedcontainers package. is there a performance advantage to using sortedlist versus a regular python list and sorting after each insertion? as i understand it, sorting is a solved problem at O(nlogn) so whatever sortedlist does to maintain sorting at all times cant be any faster then the standardlib sorting function, right?"
863,2017-09-17T04:38:48.000054,Catheryn,whats the performance of binary search using bisection? i think thats what sortedcontainers library uses

864,2017-09-17T04:20:21.000011,Suellen,"If you insert and then sort, you're doing `n * n * logn` which is `n^2`"
864,2017-09-17T04:21:06.000034,Suellen,"if you insert something into already sorted container, you kind of already know which position it will occupy (maybe not with 100% certainty)"
864,2017-09-17T04:36:05.000046,Catheryn,"if you just append to the list then sort its 1 + n * logn, right?"
864,2017-09-17T04:40:00.000008,Suellen,"if you append every time it's N append+sort operations, and with sort itself being n*logn it becomes n^2"

864,2017-09-17T04:45:42.000009,Gabriele,"Not sure if this library does this, but one trick about sorted containers is that they don't actually need to be sorted at all times or after every insert. They only have to be sorted when you try to read from them"

866,2017-09-17T14:12:59.000102,Tatum,a tree in python turns out to be slower
866,2017-09-17T14:13:06.000062,Tatum,I think this is due to the class instantiation overhead

869,2017-09-17T18:58:45.000052,Meg,only thing that made me think of it is using pycharm with vagrant

869,2017-09-17T18:59:07.000018,Meg,"when I add pip packages in vagrant, pycharm doesn’t recognize them until after a cache invalidate and restart"
869,2017-09-17T18:59:32.000036,Meg,so made me wonder if there was something similar happening
869,2017-09-17T18:59:58.000071,Zaida,"Yeah, I’ve had to do something similar with pycharm a couple times. I guess it’s a similar venv in a sense?"
869,2017-09-17T19:01:52.000039,Meg,I don’t know. what seems to me is the remote interpreter connection doesn’t update with new packages when you install on the remote maching
869,2017-09-17T19:02:10.000113,Meg,"and in order to get pycharm to see them, you need to clear the cache and rebuild the index"
869,2017-09-17T19:02:28.000077,Meg,which can only be done via cache invalidate and restart
869,2017-09-17T19:03:02.000107,Zaida,Does the cache invalidate thing happen when you just close pycharm and open it again?
869,2017-09-17T19:06:22.000062,Meg,I don’t believe so
869,2017-09-17T19:06:38.000072,Zaida,"Ah, maybe I haven’t encountered that before, then."
869,2017-09-17T19:06:40.000005,Meg,because cache invalidate happens when you select the option in File menu

871,2017-09-18T04:39:33.000048,Junita,"oh, I see what you are saying.  Do you want one response, that sums it all up?"

871,2017-09-18T04:46:06.000062,Junita,I guess I’m not understanding the problem then.   What do you mean by “make it deterministic” - do you feel like it’s non-deterministic now?  Do you get different values on different runs?
871,2017-09-18T04:46:53.000442,Desire,now these two variables   `core_capital` and `nest_capital` should have the value of the respective products if the user has them in his portfolio or it should be 0.
871,2017-09-18T04:48:25.000337,Junita,have you tried something like `for item in capital.data:` and then replacing instances of `capital.data[0]` with `item`?
871,2017-09-18T04:48:41.000283,Desire,"No, i will try that"
871,2017-09-18T04:48:47.000231,Junita,and accumulate the results

875,2017-09-19T06:04:14.000187,Tracey,"Hi Everyone, looking for a bit of advice on where to being reading, libraries to look at maybe some examples if there is one.  I have a list of 180,000 items I need matching images for, so want to download images from a google search, rename the image to the search string, create a 100x100 thumbnail, upload the original and thumbnail image to an s3 bucket and add the new file name to the original csv file.  I am really new to python so apologies if this has been asked before."
875,2017-09-19T06:07:01.000238,Meg,that is a _really_ ambitious scale
875,2017-09-19T06:08:21.000043,Meg,"because if you’re running it on your own machine for 100 items, it could take about two seconds per item to execute"
875,2017-09-19T06:08:33.000208,Meg,that’s about two minutes there to test
875,2017-09-19T06:09:33.000012,Tracey,"Ahhh ok, time does not really matter, I can sit and leave the machine running int he background."
875,2017-09-19T06:09:41.000265,Meg,"and assume you’re able to get it down to a half second per item when deployed, that’s still 25 hours of execution time"
875,2017-09-19T06:10:37.000119,Meg,"and if you’re still on the two second/item average, that’s basically four days"
875,2017-09-19T06:11:10.000048,Junita,which means you’ll definitely want to be able to track your progress locally so you don’t have to rerun it from scratch when it inevitably fails partway through for some reason.  :slightly_smiling_face:
875,2017-09-19T06:11:15.000408,Meg,yup

875,2017-09-19T06:12:25.000370,Tracey,I know python on a basic level and have experience in javascript
875,2017-09-19T06:13:19.000191,Junita,well a couple things there - google often has apis you can interface with directly instead of trying to scrape a page.  I’d look into that to see if that’s possible
875,2017-09-19T06:13:32.000107,Junita,it’ll also help because they’ll eventually shut you off otherwise

875,2017-09-19T06:15:36.000109,Meg,"use custom search instead, which apparently is an umbrella replacement"
875,2017-09-19T06:15:38.000261,Junita,<@Gabriele> you can usually specify licensing in the search

875,2017-09-19T06:16:06.000024,Tracey,<@Meg> thanks for that
875,2017-09-19T06:16:11.000100,Gabriele,"It might be possible to get results with a legit licence, yeah"
875,2017-09-19T06:16:29.000346,Junita,"I have no idea if that will be possible through the custom search though, it is through the UI"
875,2017-09-19T06:17:15.000204,Tracey,"any particular libraries I should look at? I know Boto will handle the upload to S3 and urllib will grab the images from the search, what can I use to resize the image  / create the thumb?"
875,2017-09-19T06:17:32.000302,Meg,I’d use `requests` in place of urlib
875,2017-09-19T06:17:47.000008,Meg,and use `Pillow` for the image manipulation
875,2017-09-19T06:17:52.000234,Tracey,Ok thanks for that
875,2017-09-19T06:18:07.000070,Meg,"if you want speed, you can use imagemagick and call it via subprocess"

875,2017-09-19T06:24:53.000390,Tracey,The feature of image detection algorithms look really helpful
875,2017-09-19T06:25:28.000073,Carri,"although if you were to use Pillow, and are running on a machine that supports SIMD instructions I'd recommend this drop-in replacement that's substantially faster than vanilla Pillow <https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd>"
875,2017-09-19T06:26:19.000055,Carri,"&gt; Pillow-SIMD with AVX2 is always 16 to 40 times faster than ImageMagick and outperforms Skia, the high-speed graphics library used in Chromium."

875,2017-09-19T06:55:28.000061,Carri,"yeah, in some forms. although it has evolved to SSE4 these days, and AVX support from 2011"
875,2017-09-19T07:02:28.000150,Adell,"Anyone know how it's possible to run a function in a class through a subclass with multiprocessing?
So I have a `class tracker` which I'm calling with a subclass called `class Track(tracker)`. 

I then have a list containing many subclasses: `Track`, I would like to call a function and give the same input ""an image"" to each subclass `Track` by using multiprocessing. 
Currently it is working using: 
```
for i in range(len(listOfTracks)):
    listOfTracks[i].update(image)
```

And then i can extract the information from each Track using a call to `pos = listOfTracks[i].get_position` 

When I'm trying to add multiprocessing to it, I never receive the updated position, but I can see the image I input is different, but it seems like it's not saving or updating as before, since the `Tracks.get_position` call always return the same position. 
```
procs = []
for i in range(len(tracker)):
     p = mp.Process(target=tracker[i].renew, args=(img,))
     procs.append(p)
     p.start()
     
for p in procs:
     p.join()
```"

878,2017-09-19T08:06:06.000013,Vada,<@Bell> if you are just doing basic queries look at mysqlclient here <https://github.com/PyMySQL/mysqlclient-python>
878,2017-09-19T08:06:27.000344,Vada,It's pretty simple and easy to use. There are examples here: <https://mysqlclient.readthedocs.io/>
878,2017-09-19T08:06:50.000093,Vada,If you are doing anything more complex have a look at an ORM like sqlalchemy as <@Fabiola> has said
878,2017-09-19T08:08:26.000271,Bell,Let me check on the docs and ping later. Thanks for both of you
879,2017-09-19T11:09:52.000049,Mallie,My SO question on `celerybeat` got an upvote after 7 months! There is still hope :astonished: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42322486/celery-beat-schedule-schedule-to-run-on-load-then-on-interval>
879,2017-09-19T11:10:11.000805,Mallie,If anyone knows the answer in here that'd be awesome.
880,2017-09-19T11:21:38.000420,Vada,Why not schedule a task on startup?
880,2017-09-19T11:21:55.000257,Vada,your project will have a main.py or something right?
880,2017-09-19T11:22:02.000370,Vada,<@Mallie>
880,2017-09-19T11:29:21.000622,Mallie,"<@Vada> Because it is a longer running task and I don't want it to overlap, nor preferably would I have to track state for objects updated (which is an option). Right now I want it to run hourly and it finishes within 30 minutes, but I don't want it to run over itself. Scheduling a task on startup would just mean enqueuing it when the service starts? That would be esp. troublesome in the way I stated because I need to restart the celery services when I deploy code (it is a production Django project). I have hooks to reset the service so it'd be great if the functionality existed so I could just delete the right file or run the right command to run the task on startup but not have the interval locked again to always run 1 hour from when it was originally scheduled."
880,2017-09-19T11:30:43.000249,Mallie,"As it is now it is easily worked around by not updating code related to the task during the interval (:00 - :30) every hour, and if the code isn't related, just restarting the services. So it is managed by controlling releases."
880,2017-09-19T11:30:59.000536,Mallie,"But if I did have to make a critical code update to the task, I wish I could just force it to reset after purging the queue."
880,2017-09-19T11:33:33.000447,Vada,I see two options
880,2017-09-19T11:34:04.000871,Vada,1) You have a check (e.g. a cache lock or anything else) which the task checks - if the lock is active the task dies
880,2017-09-19T11:34:16.000309,Vada,2) The task calls itself on finish - scheduling the next run that way
880,2017-09-19T11:34:19.000074,Vada,neither would use beat
880,2017-09-19T11:34:35.000095,Vada,I think beat is wrong for this if you want to schedule it from after it runs on startup
880,2017-09-19T11:34:45.000054,Vada,and definitely wrong if it cannot run concurrently
880,2017-09-19T11:38:04.000273,Mallie,"So (2) is interesting - is there a way to do that in celery? I wasn't aware. Like, I could see the end of the task and say `run again in n minutes`? That'd be fine, I thought `celerybeat` was the only option for scheduling"
880,2017-09-19T11:38:34.000412,Vada,"I've not done it myself, but considering python supports recursion, you should be able to just call the task again"
880,2017-09-19T11:38:49.000054,Meg,or call an api endpoint for which generates a new task
880,2017-09-19T11:39:19.000841,Vada,"e.g.

```
@task
def this_task():
    # do stuff
    this_task.delay()
```"
880,2017-09-19T11:39:49.000577,Meg,"you could also do something at the end of your run like

```
    task = SomeTask()
    task.apply_async(args = args, queue = 'queue')
```"
880,2017-09-19T11:40:18.000135,Vada,<@Meg> that means you need another task to call that endpoint to trigger the task though :wink:
880,2017-09-19T11:40:57.000402,Meg,not always
880,2017-09-19T11:41:10.000375,Mallie,"So I didn't realize
```eta (datetime) – Absolute time and date of when the task should be executed. May not be specified if countdown is also supplied.```
existed, nor `countdown` for that matter"
880,2017-09-19T11:41:11.000145,Meg,have a view handler
880,2017-09-19T11:41:22.000114,Meg,and post to said URL
880,2017-09-19T11:42:01.000725,Vada,"yep although  if the only reason you are doing it every hour is so it doesn't overlap, you may as well just do the countdown"
880,2017-09-19T11:42:25.000353,Mallie,Yeah just saw that too hah
880,2017-09-19T11:42:42.000477,Mallie,I thought the only options were `do now` or `celerybeat` so that's cool
880,2017-09-19T11:43:45.000398,Vada,<@Meg> but why would that be better than the task calling itself?
880,2017-09-19T11:43:52.000190,Mallie,<@Vada> :taco:
880,2017-09-19T11:44:02.000356,Vada,"I mean that is the task calling itself, but via an API endpoint right?"
880,2017-09-19T11:44:06.000135,Vada,ty <@Mallie>
880,2017-09-19T11:44:07.000155,Mallie,If this Slack existed when I first was working with celery would've been great lol
880,2017-09-19T11:44:07.000222,Meg,"ah, never mind"
880,2017-09-19T11:44:16.000454,Mallie,Instead of my 7 mo issue and SO question
880,2017-09-19T11:44:19.000662,Meg,I was thinking recursion depth
880,2017-09-19T11:44:27.000124,Meg,and trying to avoid bottoming out
880,2017-09-19T11:44:35.000686,Vada,Haha I can post an SO response as well if you want
880,2017-09-19T11:44:44.000119,Meg,"so when a task calls itself, does it get put in the broker?"
880,2017-09-19T11:44:52.000465,Meg,or does it immediately execute on the same worker
880,2017-09-19T11:45:04.000309,Vada,"yeah delay doesn't actually call the task, it posts it to the message broker"
880,2017-09-19T11:45:15.000437,Meg,gotcha
880,2017-09-19T11:45:26.000357,Meg,"ah, then `run` would execute immediately on the worker"
880,2017-09-19T11:45:27.000461,Vada,so it should become a separate stack - although I'd be very interested/surprised if that isn't the case
880,2017-09-19T11:45:42.000289,Meg,"FWIW, I prefer `apply_async` vs `delay`"
880,2017-09-19T11:45:58.000125,Vada,They're essentially the same thing righht?
880,2017-09-19T11:46:06.000485,Meg,"because it lets me specify the args, queue and any potential tasks to run after sequence"
880,2017-09-19T11:46:27.000746,Meg,`delay` is a simplified `apply_async` with non-overrideable defaults
880,2017-09-19T11:46:34.000025,Vada,yeah that's true
880,2017-09-19T11:46:45.000523,Vada,"I default to delay, but use all of them in some places."
880,2017-09-19T11:54:35.000326,Mallie,"So another question, and this may get more into broker specifics, but does anyone know how celery/RabbitMQ would handle scheduling *a lot* of tasks (30k+)? Right now I update a large number of objects via `requests`, so I just queue them up in order once an hour - that was really the only good option with using `celerybeat`, but with what I just learned, it would be conceivable to set a timeout 60 min from the run time for _each_ object at the startup. Approximately 60 min is/will be sufficient for these objects to update, so the container task to just enqueue them (unscheduled) at the same time has been fine and i wouldn't make things more complicated without a reason. Just wondering how it might handle it if I had an interest in doing it differently in the future, e.g. I wanted objects to update at a different rate. So a few parts:

1) Would it have any issue with retaining an `eta` or `timeout` for a lot of tasks (let's just say 100k)
2) Is there a simple way to inspect if a task is currently scheduled?"
880,2017-09-19T11:56:03.000679,Vada,for 2
880,2017-09-19T11:56:09.000385,Vada,"you mean personally, or by a program?"
880,2017-09-19T11:57:31.000388,Mallie,"Programmatically, b/c it would basically be `if this object task not scheduled scheduled, schedule this object task` because I would need to run the checker on some interval since objects may be added by users"
880,2017-09-19T11:57:48.000192,Mallie,"Then, have the object task schedule its next run when it is done, and so on"
880,2017-09-19T11:57:58.000396,Mallie,I'm not sure if I could do that without tracking state
880,2017-09-19T11:58:11.000402,Vada,"so for 1, no it won't have an issue - but you may have a bottleneck in terms of your numbers of workers."
880,2017-09-19T11:58:20.000704,Vada,so regardless of ETA
880,2017-09-19T11:58:30.000664,Vada,"if there aren't enough workers to get the job done, it'll take a while"
880,2017-09-19T12:00:01.000312,Mallie,"Well now enqueing them all at once only takes about 30 minutes with current config, so I have an external job to check the stats to make sure it doesn't need to be tweaked and so on. Spreading them out would be perfectly acceptable, it was just unmanageable with `celerybeat` obv."
880,2017-09-19T12:00:14.000059,Vada,for 2) You can check what tasks are in the queue and inspect the workers (e.g. <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html?highlight=revoke#inspecting-workers>)
880,2017-09-19T12:00:49.000686,Mallie,Ah sick
880,2017-09-19T12:00:56.000182,Vada,One of the things we have in house is an RSS feed processor which can't be run concurrently
880,2017-09-19T12:01:03.000051,Vada,celery has a cookbook for this
880,2017-09-19T12:01:03.000419,Vada,<http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/tutorials/task-cookbook.html#ensuring-a-task-is-only-executed-one-at-a-time>
880,2017-09-19T12:01:17.000034,Vada,specific to django
880,2017-09-19T12:01:24.000245,Vada,so that is worth looking at as well
880,2017-09-19T12:01:42.000270,Mallie,Great great <@Vada> :taco:
880,2017-09-19T12:01:45.000616,Mallie,el dubble taco
880,2017-09-19T12:01:53.000156,Vada,:slightly_smiling_face:
880,2017-09-19T12:02:25.000470,Mallie,That'll be great to consider later if I have an interest in tweaking things for users that may warrant more frequent updates and so on so very cool
880,2017-09-19T12:03:00.000120,Mallie,"The thing I query actually may chance every second, but the 60 minutes is an acceptable ""free"" aggregate update"
880,2017-09-19T12:03:10.000454,Mallie,So that'd be cool to be able to tweak it per-object
880,2017-09-19T12:03:50.000142,Mallie,And I just added `memcached` a few weeks ago
880,2017-09-19T12:05:22.000459,Mallie,"Also, up to you if you want to nab the question <@Vada>, I think the alternatives you have raised are a good solution"
880,2017-09-19T12:05:44.000027,Mallie,So I'd accept it and you could get them sweet SO duckets
880,2017-09-19T12:08:53.000004,Vada,I mean in an ideal world you'd schedule a task every time it updates as a post-commit hook
880,2017-09-19T12:10:16.000371,Mallie,Well our deployment isn't based on a repo action - it is rolled into a single command but it requires someone (me) to tell it to release
880,2017-09-19T12:11:18.000536,Mallie,"But if I were to leave `celerybeat` and just make sure each object schedules itself out at end run, if there is a necessary change it would still affect them all after a release so should be fine"
880,2017-09-19T12:12:35.000305,Mallie,Every release I just restart `celerybeat` and `celeryd` in case related code changes - I have never experienced issues there
880,2017-09-19T12:12:38.000280,Vada,Post db commit :wink:
880,2017-09-19T12:12:48.000615,Vada,not git commit

880,2017-09-19T12:13:20.000277,Vada,but I can see how that misled you
880,2017-09-19T12:13:50.000317,Mallie,I was a bit confused as to how that'd work lol

880,2017-09-19T12:18:25.000362,Mallie,Well sheesh after my experience on SO and talking within other groups I was thinking no one used celery

880,2017-09-19T18:01:03.000001,Johana,it’s webpack that will see the import and extract the css for you.
880,2017-09-19T18:01:09.000131,Johana,as it builds your project.
880,2017-09-19T18:01:48.000284,Johana,my style above also uses the sass way guide. <http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project>
880,2017-09-19T18:03:24.000418,Kayce,Mine does as well. I'll setup a js file to import the scss and see how that goes.
880,2017-09-19T18:04:03.000143,Johana,in your plugin you are already specifying what you want the output to be.
880,2017-09-19T18:04:11.000250,Johana,`new ExtractTextPlugin('./website/static/css/bundle.css')`
880,2017-09-19T18:04:42.000039,Johana,you can even include hashes and shas if you want for caching.

I'm initialising a subclass of correlation_tracker which I called Tracker for each detection. 

Next image I'm calling each subclasses.update function with the new image and then the function updates the tracker to a new position depending on the image input (it searches nearby its old position) and it gives a confidence score in how well it did it as an output. 

Then I call the subclass.get_position() which should return the trackers position, but this position stays static (with the same numbers as when I initialised it with the `[tracker[i].start(img, rectangle(*rect)) for i, rect in enumerate(points)]` call."
891,2017-09-20T07:25:00.000189,Gabriele,What is `correlation_tracker`? Is that safe for use across multiple processes?
891,2017-09-20T07:25:13.000204,Gabriele,"And when you say you can't extract the position, what actually happens instead?"
891,2017-09-20T07:41:21.000197,Adell,"<@Gabriele> correlation_tracker is from the dlib library <http://dlib.net/imaging.html#correlation_tracker>. I'm not sure if its safe, but I suppose since I initialise several instances of it, that each instance should be able to run in multiple processes ? (I might be wrong here)
About extracting the position, I can execute the command but I don't get an updated position from the tracker, it stays the same value as when I initialised it."
891,2017-09-20T07:53:48.000078,Gabriele,"It's hard to make assumptions about 3rd party software although I'd hope that each process would be sufficiently isolated. What is the actual result variable you're watching here, or the function you expect to do the work? I don't know dlib."
891,2017-09-20T07:59:04.000123,Adell,not sure if you can follow me
891,2017-09-20T08:00:28.000265,Adell,"I have a list with objects where I'm trying to call each objects update function and this is where I would like to do it in multiple processes, so each object can update parallel and be done ~the same time, instead of after each other."
891,2017-09-20T08:04:39.000187,Gabriele,"Okay. It's still a bit confusing to follow, partly because you have commented out code in there which doesn't look like it would ever do the right thing, such as each tracker creating its own Pool, or calling amap which doesn't seem to be a documented function"
891,2017-09-20T08:05:26.000408,Gabriele,"I'd recommend maybe writing a similar test case where you replace the dlib stuff with a dummy function of your own choosing, and verify whether that works correctly or not. If not, the problem is elsewhere in your code"
891,2017-09-20T08:14:37.000130,Adell,"The pool thing is some old code from old experiments with it. I get your idea and will try it out and see if I can get anything to work.

898,2017-09-21T05:36:07.000160,Gwenda,thanks for your input <@Gabriele>!
898,2017-09-21T06:25:16.000218,Gwenda,yup it was an issue with the unittest package
898,2017-09-21T06:25:25.000017,Gwenda,I switched to nose and now it works fine
898,2017-09-21T06:27:39.000032,Suellen,:fidget_spinners: pytest :fidget_spinners: only :fidget_spinners:
898,2017-09-21T06:28:07.000010,Suellen,I'm a kid-these-days
898,2017-09-21T06:29:04.000058,Gwenda,haha
898,2017-09-21T06:29:16.000215,Gabriele,I switched to pytest myself. But I run it from Pycharm so I've no idea how it works outside of there
898,2017-09-21T06:36:16.000323,Junita,"what does pytest do that nose doesn’t?  I feel like I asked this question, got a satisfactory answer, but I’ve forgotten.  :stuck_out_tongue:"
898,2017-09-21T06:36:28.000035,Junita,I suppose one valid answer is “get actively developed”  :stuck_out_tongue:
898,2017-09-21T06:37:03.000201,Collette,"`assert`, fixtures, plugins, parametrized fixtures and test cases, test functions instead of classes..."
898,2017-09-21T06:37:06.000339,Collette,"lots of things, actually"
898,2017-09-21T06:37:26.000167,Collette,They have only one thing in common: they're both test runners.
898,2017-09-21T06:37:29.000087,Gabriele,"it has some magic fixture stuff, which looks pretty but which I dislike because of the magicness. But I'm sure it can make for quick test development"
898,2017-09-21T06:38:28.000282,Suellen,&gt; dislike because of the magicness
898,2017-09-21T06:38:39.000180,Suellen,"yeah, I hate python, where is my `malloc()` :stuck_out_tongue:"
898,2017-09-21T06:38:56.000185,Gabriele,Not really the same thing
898,2017-09-21T06:39:29.000010,Gabriele,In this case I'm talking about decorators that magically rewrite things to inject arguments
898,2017-09-21T06:39:54.000231,Collette,"^ that's my biggest concern, too."
898,2017-09-21T06:40:03.000067,Suellen,"why magically? they just rewrite things, not magically"
898,2017-09-21T06:40:20.000115,Collette,I'd rather want to explicitly request fixtures to use in test functions
898,2017-09-21T06:40:30.000051,Gabriele,"All sufficiently advanced technology looks like magic. This is advanced and mostly hidden, so I call it magic"
898,2017-09-21T06:40:40.000255,Gabriele,"""explicit is better than implicit"", right?"
898,2017-09-21T06:40:52.000326,Suellen,"implicit is implicit, not magic :confused:"
898,2017-09-21T06:40:53.000003,Collette,"i.e. ```
@pytest.use_fixtures('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
def test_stuff(foo, bar, baz):
    assert foo == bar == baz
```"
898,2017-09-21T06:41:07.000061,Suellen,<@Collette> you can do this :))
898,2017-09-21T06:41:17.000210,Collette,Link?
898,2017-09-21T06:41:59.000305,Suellen,<https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html#usefixtures>
898,2017-09-21T06:42:20.000225,Collette,It's not the same.
898,2017-09-21T06:42:51.000180,Junita,"I guess of that list, plugins could be nice"
898,2017-09-21T06:42:59.000263,Suellen,"in older pytest versions this was the only way, but now you can do it implicitly too
I remember the older tests I've written when there was no fixture injection."
898,2017-09-21T06:43:04.000214,Junita,the others I seem to be getting away with on my own just fine.  I mean it’s not like I don’t have fixtures.
898,2017-09-21T06:43:17.000038,Collette,"In my example I can actually _use_ fixture objects in the test function, while `@usefixtures` is just, well, ""enabling"" fixtures for that test function"
898,2017-09-21T06:43:40.000214,Junita,"and you could always test functions instead of classes, right?"
898,2017-09-21T06:44:31.000400,Collette,"<@Junita> what? `nose` is a runner for `unittest.TestCase` cases, you can't write a dedicated test function and expect `nose` to discover it"
898,2017-09-21T06:44:52.000012,Suellen,<@Collette> I don't really understand the distinction. In older pytest versions `usefixtures` is the only way to access a fixture in a test function. The result is the same.
898,2017-09-21T06:45:07.000211,Suellen,"Without it you can't do it, with it you can. :confused:"
898,2017-09-21T06:46:03.000078,Junita,"&gt; Within a test module, functions and classes whose names match testMatch and TestCase subclasses with any name will be loaded and executed as tests
<https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>"
898,2017-09-21T06:46:28.000118,Junita,"I mean, I’ve done it, the docs say it, so you definitely can"
898,2017-09-21T06:47:46.000009,Collette,"hmm, i guess information in my head is outdated then"
898,2017-09-21T06:47:57.000296,Collette,"but you can't define `setUp`/`tearDown` for these test functions, right?"
898,2017-09-21T06:48:00.000206,Junita,"yeah maybe at some point in the past you couldn’t, it’s possible"
898,2017-09-21T06:48:31.000012,Junita,"To my knowledge, no.  If I’m going to do `setUp` and `tearDown` I’m going to just use a class"
898,2017-09-21T06:48:50.000251,Collette,Right
898,2017-09-21T06:49:11.000008,Collette,"From my experience, I pretty much always need fixtures/setUp :slightly_smiling_face:"
898,2017-09-21T06:49:29.000105,Collette,The only exception is test functions in which I test whatever is in a fixture/setUp method
898,2017-09-21T06:51:45.000311,Suellen,<@Collette> can you explain how they are different? it's totally lost on me :confused:
898,2017-09-21T06:52:02.000015,Collette,'they'?
898,2017-09-21T06:53:36.000249,Suellen,"&gt; In my example I can actually _use_ fixture objects in the test function, while `@usefixtures` is just, well, ""enabling"" fixtures for that test function"
898,2017-09-21T06:54:06.000059,Suellen,"I think I'm missing something, but the behaviour seems identical to me"
898,2017-09-21T06:55:15.000245,Collette,"I was thinking about the case when ```
@pytest.mark.usefixtures('foo')
def test_foo(foo):
    pass
```
passes, but ```
def test_foo(foo):
    pass
```
fails with `TypeError` about missing arguments"
898,2017-09-21T06:56:06.000253,Collette,I also dislike that whole `pytest.mark` idea. It's so highly dynamic that introspection doesn't work
898,2017-09-21T06:56:39.000163,Suellen,"&gt; fails with `TypeError` about missing arguments
It was like that before they decided to make fixtures available by default, which is not really nice... I agree."
898,2017-09-21T06:58:08.000140,Collette,"Maybe given py3 annotations, we could at least do ```
def test_foo(foo: pytest.fixture)
```..."
898,2017-09-21T06:59:17.000247,Suellen,"I wish some projects, especially that can hugely benefit from annotations, dropped py2"
898,2017-09-21T06:59:28.000002,Collette,django? :slightly_smiling_face:
898,2017-09-21T07:00:55.000294,Suellen,"I have almost zero experience with Django, but if it's anything like Flask then lack of certain py3-only features doesn't really stand in the way too much.
But some flask extensions are py3-only and they use annotations to define endpoints which is really cool if you're designing an API"
898,2017-09-21T07:04:52.000241,Mariano,On pycharm. Is there a way to see what method will be called when a class inherit from two classes with the same method and no super?
899,2017-09-21T06:03:16.000016,Junita,"what happens if you try to import from db directly?  I think a lot of the test runners (I’ve never used unittest discover myself, so just speaking generally here) add the root folder to your search path"
899,2017-09-21T06:03:30.000423,Junita,when you try and import from `pokemon_scraper` you are trying to import from the directory above that
899,2017-09-21T06:04:36.000263,Junita,"I usually also contain my code within a `src` directory, or something like that, to help keep things tidy, and then import in my tests from `src`"
899,2017-09-21T06:27:12.000212,Junita,"cool.  I *think* nose is on the outs though, right?  I still use it all over the place because I’m old and stubborn, but is it still under active development?"
899,2017-09-21T06:27:21.000384,Junita,I think the kids these days are using pytest or something similar?
900,2017-09-21T07:11:39.000218,Junita,"not sure about pycharm, but in the debugger you can look at `__mro__`"
900,2017-09-21T07:26:37.000342,Mariano,That's good enough <@Junita> :taco:

901,2017-09-21T10:07:47.000497,Gwenda,Anyone familiar with `async/await` ?
901,2017-09-21T10:08:37.000253,Gwenda,I was wondering if it's relevant to use this construct in the context of DB operations
901,2017-09-21T10:08:43.000406,Gwenda,say DB insertion for example
901,2017-09-21T10:09:10.000162,Gabriele,"It's likely to be an overcomplication unless you truly know that you need it, and even then there are other optimisations to try first"
901,2017-09-21T10:09:33.000318,Ciera,yeah depends on how things are made.
901,2017-09-21T10:09:42.000439,Gwenda,what kind of other optimisations ? (out of curiosity)
901,2017-09-21T10:09:58.000008,Gabriele,Depends on the application
901,2017-09-21T10:10:03.000159,Ciera,someone wrote an article a bit ago arguing that async for db isn't useful as they are so fast.
901,2017-09-21T10:10:12.000498,Gabriele,"Maybe you don't need an insert, maybe you can postpone it, maybe you can write to a cache, etc"
901,2017-09-21T10:10:16.000629,Ciera,but if all your app is async you might as well use it
901,2017-09-21T10:10:30.000240,Gwenda,ah I see !
901,2017-09-21T10:10:50.000705,Gabriele,"<@Ciera> I expect you mean this one, by the author of SQLAlchemy - <http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/>"
901,2017-09-21T10:11:02.000370,Gwenda,The thing is I failed to find a concrete usage example for async/await
901,2017-09-21T10:11:14.000396,Gabriele,"I don't agree with all the conclusions, but broadly speaking it's right"
901,2017-09-21T10:11:14.000409,Gwenda,even for a simple http request to an external service
901,2017-09-21T10:11:18.000713,Ciera,<@Gabriele> yes thanks :taco:
901,2017-09-21T10:11:51.000459,Gabriele,"If you have an application that needs to perform slow I/O operations as well as be responsive in some other way, then async operations may be what you need"
901,2017-09-21T10:12:37.000001,Gabriele,"e.g. I write video games, and I don't want to hang the whole game while we do a Quick Save, because we need to render every 16 or 32 milliseconds. So we do the save asynchronously"
901,2017-09-21T10:12:39.000697,Ciera,<@Gwenda> you might want to read <@Signe> article <https://hackernoon.com/async-through-the-looking-glass-d69a0a88b661>
901,2017-09-21T10:12:49.000735,Gabriele,"This sort of thing doesn't come up in Python that often, I'd argue"
901,2017-09-21T10:13:22.000152,Ciera,this one might be best to start <https://hackernoon.com/asynchronous-python-45df84b82434>
901,2017-09-21T10:42:58.000156,Gwenda,thanks a lot <@Ciera> :taco:

902,2017-09-21T11:02:25.000732,Gwenda,yup the first one
902,2017-09-21T11:02:40.000086,Gwenda,was particularly helpful in understanding how async vs sync works
902,2017-09-21T11:02:48.000373,Gwenda,I really liked the fast food vs bank analogy
902,2017-09-21T11:29:46.000470,Signe,awesome. Glad it helped

905,2017-09-21T14:53:30.000425,Junita,under Find you can do replace in project
905,2017-09-21T14:53:54.000098,Junita,"or sorry, under the menu it’s called “Find in Project”"
905,2017-09-21T14:53:59.000159,Junita,and then it has a replace field
905,2017-09-21T14:54:12.000180,Mallie,"Oh that's nice, I don't use Atom"
905,2017-09-21T14:54:28.000637,Junita,I do find it’s useful to “Find All” first to make sure you are actually aware of what will be changed
905,2017-09-21T14:55:02.000464,Dominick,Nice - i'll check that out. I can see where you could screw up a lot really fast but I figure if it's one line it'd be safe.

905,2017-09-21T14:56:52.000191,Junita,so maybe I owe you a taco back.  :stuck_out_tongue:
905,2017-09-21T14:57:20.000319,Dominick,Haha hmmm...ya I always wondered if any IDEs out there did allow multi-line replace...cuz that seems useful.

Emacs isn't an IDE persay (though you can customize it to one) but you can do multi-line replace. Visual Studio has an add-on for it I've never tested... For Atom though jkelly's issue tells you the status there."
905,2017-09-21T15:04:18.000018,Dominick,"<@Mallie> Definitely. I've never used emacs or visual studio actually. Looks like it doesn't quite work in Atom, but Find in Project should suit my needs. More of an exploratory question at this point :slightly_smiling_face:"
905,2017-09-21T15:04:53.000224,Mallie,"If you have a need for it that you think will take too much time in Atom, could always jump to something like `sed` that I mentioned to"
905,2017-09-21T15:05:04.000711,Mallie,Just depends on if learning the steps is faster at that time and such...

I'm trying to take a legal document and a re-written version of the same document in more common speech, and be able to automate this process. Any ideas?

913,2017-09-22T12:56:13.000315,Yessenia,How can I convert number like this 2.7e-07 to 0.000000
913,2017-09-22T13:03:57.000214,Tanya,You can use format with fixed point
913,2017-09-22T13:04:09.000061,Tanya,"`format(2.7e-07, 'f')`"
913,2017-09-22T13:05:36.000038,Orpha,you could also try casting to float
913,2017-09-22T13:05:44.000569,Orpha,float(2.7e-07)
913,2017-09-22T13:06:10.000633,Orpha,format seems to be the way to go on stack though
914,2017-09-22T15:10:30.000190,Jesusa,does anyone know how to implement a repr that will be pretty printed without inheriting from list?
914,2017-09-22T15:10:42.000070,Jesusa,e.g.
914,2017-09-22T15:10:55.000025,Jesusa,"`Dot([1, 2, 3])` is a nice repr"
914,2017-09-22T15:11:14.000177,Jesusa,but this is what happens
914,2017-09-22T15:11:24.000061,Jesusa,"`Dot([1, 2, 3, ... 100])`  (where ... is actually just all numbers)"
914,2017-09-22T15:11:35.000608,Jesusa,a list will be pretty printed in ipython though

Lately, I am involved in a project, which involves many stemmed and hashed values. Does anybody have experience in dealing with hashed values, then your help is needed.
Thank you"

You are more likely to get an answer that way - either people know what you are talking about, they are interested enough to look it up, or the issue you have may be unrelated to a specific topic and more a general python issue"

929,2017-09-25T10:28:57.000252,Cleotilde,"Hi all. I came to know about the usage of filter along with lambda function in Python. Just like the the following 
```d = {'a': None, 'b': 'myname', 'c': 122}
print dict(filter(lambda x:x[1], d.items()))
{'b': 'myname', 'c': 122}```.  The result is `a` get popped. That’s what actually I need. Here I couldn’t figure out what does x:x[1] stands for. It would be great if someone explain me what is exactly happening. Thanks in advance."
929,2017-09-25T10:30:29.000036,Collette,"<@Cleotilde> lambda is pretty much the same as ```
def to_filter(x):
    return bool(x[1])
```"
929,2017-09-25T10:31:01.000400,Cleotilde,Okay.

929,2017-09-25T10:32:23.000052,Antionette,so in this case if the value is falsy it gets filtered out

931,2017-09-25T16:08:39.000453,Meg,"anyone here with bulk indexing in solr experience?  I have a project coming up in which I have to index about 10 million web pages on S3 as well as an continual average of 20k or so per week.  Objects in the celery bucket are like `/bucket_name/$db_id/path/to/file.ext`

Distributor task - take in a folder ID and get all html files from the folder, recursively
Single-page index task - Responsible for indexing one single web page, started from parent task above

Using Celery, my workflow is like this:
1. Query db for IDs of records and chunk to distributor celery task
2. Celery task uses `boto3` to get all html files from the S3 `bucket_name/db_id` 'folder'  Puts path in queue for single-page index task
3. Individual page processes and inserts into mysql db table
4. Once all child tasks are finished, parent task triggers a Solr DataImportHandler API call to do a delta-import from the mysql table, which should import all the recently inserted data from mysql into solr
5. After import is complete, delete all imported rows from mysql table"
931,2017-09-25T16:09:26.000417,Meg,"I plan on using at least four distributor workers, and about 20 single page workers, so this can easily overwhelm the solr import API"

934,2017-09-26T07:25:26.000141,Chi,morning! anyone able to give me some advice on getting out of a while loop? python newbie here
934,2017-09-26T07:25:49.000010,Jorge,use ```break```
934,2017-09-26T07:26:08.000075,Chi,not allowed for this homework assignment
934,2017-09-26T07:26:55.000315,Jorge,"write some condition in while ,eg:"
934,2017-09-26T07:27:04.000171,Jorge,```while count&lt;0```
934,2017-09-26T07:30:21.000330,Chi,"maybe some context would help. the assignment is to recreate the game of “Pig”, human vs computer. player rolls a die, and can keep rolling as many times as they want, and then the other player rolls. first player to 50 wins.  if you roll a 6, your entire score for that round is 0. I’m work on the ask_yes_or_no method, which includes a prompt."
934,2017-09-26T07:38:50.000054,Ciera,"```
a = True
while a:
  a = False
```"
934,2017-09-26T07:42:52.000385,Shelly,"<@Chi> if you need to prompt, you can use something like `input(""Enter yes or no"")`"
934,2017-09-26T07:44:42.000196,Chi,the code is doing the opposite of what I want it to do.
934,2017-09-26T07:45:09.000178,Chi,not sure if it’s appropriate to post the entire thing here (it’s 100 lines)
934,2017-09-26T07:46:15.000010,Chi,"this is the prompt function ```def ask_yes_or_no(prompt): 
     roll_again = True
     while roll_again:
          answer = input(prompt)
          if answer.startswith(""y"") or answer == ""yes"":
              roll_again = False #why does it run properly when roll_again = False and not True?
              
          elif answer.startswith(""n"") or answer == ""no"":
               break #not allowed, but not sure how else to get out of this
               
          else:

```"
934,2017-09-26T07:46:29.000401,Chi,"when it’s nested in the computer_move method, and i run the program, if I type “no” it loops back and rolls the die again. if i type “yes” it just keeps asking “roll again?”"
934,2017-09-26T07:49:08.000047,Meg,"so, a while loop looks at the variable sequence and evaluates it to true or false."
934,2017-09-26T07:49:42.000217,Meg,"you only set `roll_again` once in the loop, and that's when the input is that of 'Yes, I want to roll again'"
934,2017-09-26T07:50:39.000285,Meg,you should set `roll_again` to be True` in the `if` and `False` in the `elif` block
934,2017-09-26T07:52:10.000096,Chi,"```def ask_yes_or_no(prompt): 
     roll_again = True

934,2017-09-26T07:52:51.000177,Chi,"when i enter “yes”, it just endlessly keeps asking “roll again?” when i enter “no”, it rolls the die"
934,2017-09-26T07:53:37.000052,Meg,then the issue is whatever else is within the conditionals that you're not posting here
934,2017-09-26T07:54:02.000369,Meg,you can post a code snippet by pressing the + at the side of the text entry and selecting `Code or Text Snippet`
934,2017-09-26T07:54:33.000124,Shelly,<@Chi> I feel like something is missing here
934,2017-09-26T07:55:28.000320,Chi,ok. this is the whole program so far
934,2017-09-26T07:57:05.000210,Meg,"so with `ask_yes_or_no`, you're not returning a value there to use within the `while computer:` loop"
934,2017-09-26T07:59:44.000370,Meg,"so you should modify the `ask_yes_or_no` conditionals to

```
if answer.startswith('y') or answer == 'yes':
    return True
elif answer.startswith('n') or answer == 'no':
    return False
else:
   print('Sorry?')
```"
934,2017-09-26T08:00:00.000347,Meg,because a `return` inside a loop is an implicit break execution
934,2017-09-26T08:04:04.000178,Chi,that doesn’t break the loop. it continues to roll the die
934,2017-09-26T08:04:10.000257,Meg,but I think you have your whole program structured wrong.
934,2017-09-26T08:06:02.000149,Chi,we have to use the functions provided. starter code of sorts
934,2017-09-26T08:06:18.000150,Meg,is this intro to programming?
934,2017-09-26T08:06:25.000076,Chi,yes. intro to python and java
934,2017-09-26T08:07:03.000265,Chi,thanks for your suggestions everyone. i’ll pick this back up when I get to work. have to catch the bus

Do you have any idea why? Already went to check the *$sort* operator page on MongoDB manual and although they say it works with two fields, I don't seem to be able to replicate the functionality.

&gt; ""This operation sorts the documents in the users collection, in descending order according by the age field and then in ascending order according to the value in the posts field.""  (<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sort/index.html#ascending-descending-sort>)
&gt;  ""$sort"" operator: <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/sort/index.html>

Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:"

939,2017-09-26T16:48:35.000540,Suellen,what are you using them for?
939,2017-09-26T16:49:16.000381,Suellen,fair use might apply and make things easy
939,2017-09-26T16:51:32.000646,Patty,"also <@Vita> citations need to be visible, not just an alt tag"
939,2017-09-26T16:52:01.000030,Suellen,"I don't think citation is going to help, as by default images aren't published with a license"
939,2017-09-26T16:52:17.000012,Suellen,i.e. you straight up can't use them without talking to their author

939,2017-09-26T16:52:39.000132,Patty,well that was just an “if a citation is needed”
939,2017-09-26T16:52:50.000513,Patty,"but, yes, it depends on usage"

939,2017-09-26T16:55:07.000333,Patty,so its advertising events?
939,2017-09-26T16:55:18.000685,Patty,and you want to use images from past events that were done?
939,2017-09-26T16:55:19.000153,Vita,"Wait, i said that wrong...sec"
939,2017-09-26T16:56:11.000289,Vita,It's a site for a group that will have a section for this event and the images will be used there
939,2017-09-26T16:56:20.000110,Vita,and yes to your question joe
939,2017-09-26T16:57:48.000053,Patty,so it seems like you’re using past images to promote the event?
939,2017-09-26T16:58:08.000343,Vita,Yep!
939,2017-09-26T16:59:06.000589,Patty,"yep, can’t do that without the permission of the owners of the image"
939,2017-09-26T17:00:05.000220,Vita,Even from instagram? Ok i will make sure to ask just in case

939,2017-09-26T17:06:57.000030,Patty,"but if you keep doing them you could put up notices asking for photos to be shared, etc so you can gather them for that use"
939,2017-09-26T17:07:04.000223,Patty,or have someone go to events and take photos
939,2017-09-26T17:09:18.000229,Vita,"Our plan is to have someone take photos at the next event (hopefully someone not too expensive), we had a person who took most of the photos for last year but their camera wasn't the best"

950,2017-09-27T09:55:27.000657,Bruno,@yea I got `returning` to work just playing with different things and I thought of that and was trying to find if there was a good way to do that. Mostly it was a question about joining tuples and ducks

950,2017-09-27T09:56:57.000454,Suellen,"<@Winnie> well, you can use a `with` statement to do a cleanup in case of an exception or what not
```
with request.Session() as s:
   # do stuff
```"
950,2017-09-27T09:57:23.000477,Suellen,"but if your program is killed by a signal or something like that, you are out of luck"
950,2017-09-27T10:02:16.000244,Winnie,that won't help me in the repl though right
950,2017-09-27T10:05:40.000602,Suellen,"well.. no.. if you really need a cleanup right before an exit and you're using REPL, I suggest `atexit`"
950,2017-09-27T10:06:54.000081,Meg,"so, got a celery question for the gurus here.  

Lets say you have a task that takes in an argument, and uses those args to do some processing and generate parameters for a large number of short-lived tasks to execute.

How can you have a task execute _after_ the last of those short lived tasks has executed?"
950,2017-09-27T10:07:02.000584,Suellen,"```
import atexit
atexit.register(lambda: session.close()) # or something
session = requests.Session()
...
# 1. Ctrl+D
# 2. session is safely closed
```"
950,2017-09-27T10:09:14.000634,Meg,"for example, Task A recieves its parameters, and as a result, it adds 1000 more instances of Task B to a specified queue.  

How do I get Task C to execute if and only if all of Task B created from the specific Task A have finished executing?"
950,2017-09-27T10:10:20.000388,Suellen,"I don't know much about Celery, but can Task A wait for its children, and Task C wait for Task A? Or it's not how it's typically done?"
950,2017-09-27T10:11:15.000595,Johana,"you can come up with a number of different combinations using groups, chains, and signatures."

950,2017-09-27T10:12:37.000789,Johana,yea it can take a bit
950,2017-09-27T10:13:28.000340,Winnifred,Is there a polling mechanism in celery? 
950,2017-09-27T10:13:44.000502,Patty,chains/chords should get you there <@Meg>
950,2017-09-27T10:14:07.000325,Patty,<@Winnifred> celery is pub/sub

950,2017-09-27T10:16:03.000030,Tammi,"In order to speed up queries, is it common practice to mark a model instance with `True` or `False` if it passes an error check?"
950,2017-09-27T10:16:25.000415,Johana,"<@Meg> if you want to see some of the ones i’m using you can refer to this: <https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server/blob/master/sparfa_server/tasks/calcs.py>

these are the calculations done by biglearn. they are on a particular schedule and all they do is check an endpoint for calculations. if there are calculations it may run the calcs and save the results and continue recursively or they will calculate and post their results."
950,2017-09-27T10:18:11.000242,Winnie,what does pub/sub mean
950,2017-09-27T10:20:35.000268,Johana,the environment biglearn has to work in is not very reliable so that is why it does checks for calcs. if there are no calcs it short circuits and tries again later.
950,2017-09-27T10:23:07.000040,Meg,"so my use case here is indexing many web pages on a S3 bucket.  The initial task gets called with the db ID of the S3 folder to be indexed.  Inside `run`, it gets a list of all `htm(l)` files with the db ID prefix.

I've defined another task that takes in a single S3 key URL and extracts the title and non HTML text using beautifulsoup, and insert into Solr.

What I want to do afterwards is to run a task to check Solr for how many documents for that particular DB ID were indexed.  The number of pages indexed are saved to a db field,   If 98% of all pages were indexed, then it's recorded as a success."

956,2017-09-27T14:11:30.000129,Earline,"<@Winnie> Depends what you mean by “quadratic”, but I assume you mean O(n squared) where you expected O(n)

It goes slowly because of all the string-copying going on: strings are immutable, so the expression `', ' + name` effectively means 
“take a copy of `, `, then copy all of `name` after it”

And then `s += ', ' + name` means:
“take a copy of `s`, then copy the chars in `', '` after it, then copy `name` after that”

As `s` gets longer, it is being copied much more often than needed.
You’d be better off to use `join`, e.g.
```
s = ', '.join(names)
```"
956,2017-09-27T14:42:49.000710,Carri,"Yes, but it still takes a reasonably ""significant"" amount of time to compile, even when cached. 577ns just to emit the compiled re pattern from cache (752x faster than cold cache)
```%timeit r = re.compile(""((hello)+|(hi)+)"", re.I)
The slowest run took 752.60 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached.
1000000 loops, best of 3: 577 ns per loop```"

Is there a tool I can use to schedule this python3 script to be run every morning? Cron works, but only when I have a computer awake and set to run that script.... I'm new to this, and it's one of my first scripts so what are my other options? Any way I can set up this job in the Cloud for free?"
964,2017-09-28T16:43:33.000223,Meg,Aws as a free tier for a year that you can use 
964,2017-09-28T16:53:46.000429,Beula,Another option is throw it on a cheap computer like a raspberry pi that can always run for you :slightly_smiling_face:
965,2017-09-28T16:48:33.000648,Patty,And even after the free year the lambda cost would be cheap
965,2017-09-28T16:54:59.000233,Mallie,"The lambda cost would actually probably be free after 12 mo, the free tier for lambda is always"
965,2017-09-28T16:55:37.000276,Beula,"Is there scheduling on lambda, or does that rely on another service?"
965,2017-09-28T16:56:12.000456,Mallie,"Good point - I think it is technically a cloudwatch trigger, but it's not in front of me"
965,2017-09-28T16:56:25.000108,Mallie,I don't think that scheduling costs...
965,2017-09-28T16:58:08.000272,Patty,Yeah it’s just a ttrigger
965,2017-09-28T16:58:40.000137,Patty,You can set a periodic trigger to fire lambdas
965,2017-09-28T16:59:26.000101,Mallie,I removed my link because I think you can do it in the gui easier
965,2017-09-28T16:59:32.000370,Patty,yup

965,2017-09-28T18:25:09.000286,Georgia,Nice! Thanks <@Beula> I also have a Raspberry Pi sitting around somewhere.. might give that a go too
965,2017-09-28T18:36:12.000170,Mallie,"<@Georgia> you shouldn't have to get too deep into cloudwatch to do the schedule, you should be able to add the trigger within lambda, that's just the source/type."

967,2017-09-28T20:04:10.000018,Simonne,<@Beula> for selenium that is
967,2017-09-28T20:07:25.000245,Beula,"I’m not entirely sure you can, it would be pretty hard to analyze any of the Ui interactions and which python code path it took. Instead you could just test views with various form data inputs (or whatever is appropriate) to make sure the view handles your input as expected. That depends on assuming that the framework does what it claims (which is fairly reasonable, IMO) and that a dev wired the pieces to the Ui properly (a little harder)"

970,2017-09-28T21:58:21.000110,Cynthia,"Are you sure a release has been published on PyPI with that change? (Also, strictly speaking that python_version restriction is wrong, should be &lt; '3.4')"
970,2017-09-28T22:03:34.000006,Beula,"Status active, so it may not be shipped yet (I think that would be accepted). So I may have mislead. You may need to do it in a setup.py and conditionally append the requirement on install "
970,2017-09-28T22:44:49.000129,Winnie,"<@Cynthia> I thought about that, but since the module doesn't say it support s python3.3, I left it."
970,2017-09-28T22:49:16.000204,Winnie,"<@Beula> I don't know how PyPi works.
I looked in the tar and found requires.txt doesn't have the condition.
Is that an admin specific thing that needs to be changed?"
971,2017-09-28T21:54:32.000155,Mallie,It's a lot to be sure
972,2017-09-29T00:40:13.000013,Collette,<@Lana> you should never ever use string formatting to generate SQL statements. Use <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.execute> with parameters

973,2017-09-29T07:54:57.000147,Meg,use some ftp client

973,2017-09-29T07:56:32.000066,Carri,you could also do it with fabric which is pretty easy
973,2017-09-29T07:56:39.000176,Fleta,"in case of sftp you don't need ftp server installed.
filezilla can manage sftp connection."

974,2017-09-29T08:39:37.000512,Vada,The problem is you are using SSH
974,2017-09-29T08:39:51.000206,Vada,you should be using SFTP (the protocol filezilla uses)
974,2017-09-29T08:41:11.000387,Vada,Paramiko is the most popular ssh/sftp lib that I know of

975,2017-09-29T09:13:29.000074,Belva,<@Zaida> Do you need Python for this ? It’s quite easy to automate through just bash scripting (just call scp or rsync with the local and remote folder)

975,2017-09-29T09:17:37.000386,Zaida,"I’m trying to make that all into one script that just loops on a spare laptop. I realize this is a super terrible setup, but it’s just gotta work haha. It’s a small project, not a full development setup or something."
975,2017-09-29T09:17:39.000567,Cassaundra,tq
975,2017-09-29T09:18:18.000335,Zaida,"Short answer: Web crawling just indexes the information using bots, where as Web scraping aka web data extraction is an automated software technique of extracting information from web.

975,2017-09-29T09:20:05.000301,Zaida,"The latter. Just little csv files that I scrape and need to be uploaded. If I could I’d scrape from my server but try as I might, I can’t get that to work, so this seems like the best holdover until then."
975,2017-09-29T09:28:49.000295,Meg,"typically the former downloads the pages and content to a storage container, where the latter handles parsing and analysis in-memory on the spot"
975,2017-09-29T09:50:55.000391,Belva,<@Zaida> What “data” is sent ? It looks like it’s more something that could be done with celery + rabbitmq (As the laptop(s) would be the worker(s)
975,2017-09-29T10:01:07.000272,Beula,"<@Zaida> The simple answer is to only rely on one machine, if I were you I would just set up a cron job to run on the server. You could use AWS lambda to do it even. If you want to just load from where you are at, I would go with <@Junita> 's option of rsync over ssh (<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-copy-files-with-rsync-over-ssh>)"
975,2017-09-29T10:01:24.000506,Beula,The benefit of rsync is that it only syncs incremental files - so you get a redundancy locally
975,2017-09-29T10:58:03.000710,Cynthia,"Oh, yeah, you'll need to change setup.py, I'm pretty sure. There's a couple of different suggested ways of doing that in various docs."
975,2017-09-29T11:02:15.000099,Zaida,"Thanks for the help, man. When you say “Run a chron job on the server” i assume you mean to do the web scraping?
Unfortunately I’ve smashed my head against it but I just can’t get my webscraping to work with my remote server. It’s been a huge sticking point for me, making me spend ~10 minutes a day just to do the web scraping on my machine with Selenium. 
Part of the issue is the site I’m scraping. No API, and to quote a programmer friend who checked it out:
&gt; I don’t see an xml request being made when the export button is clicked so I’m thinking they’re storing the data in cookies via JavaScript and then the export page is reading the cookies on the server side. Or it’s some kind of cool React shit that I don’t know about.

So my selenium script has to click through the buttons one at a time and download a CSV from the site. 
I tried to get it up and going on my ubuntu server, but I couldn’t get firefox up and running well."
975,2017-09-29T11:03:41.000657,Beula,"Oh, my guess is the issue you are seeing is related to not having a ""virtual framebuffer"" (e.g. the browser needs libs to paint out the screen to work)"
975,2017-09-29T11:07:45.000552,Zaida,"Interesting… Honestly it’s been over a year since I’ve tried it, so I don’t even recall the errors I was getting.  I might get some time to give it another shot. I think it was something to do with the rendering of images or some kind of color issue, so what you’re saying might be that."
975,2017-09-29T11:12:26.000203,Zaida,"about 30 small CSV files. The results of webscraping that (as of now) can only be done from a local machine and not on my server, unfortunately."

976,2017-09-29T15:33:44.000073,Earline,Might be different readline libs. I seem to remember getting fussy about that a few months back

976,2017-09-29T15:48:50.000050,Antionette,"not sure, it has to be that somehow trying to access the attribute causes the submodule to load"
976,2017-09-29T15:51:32.000135,Orpha,yea
976,2017-09-29T15:51:45.000181,Orpha,just weird that it only happens on some machines / for some people

976,2017-09-29T15:56:12.000078,Orpha,but thats just for the cli though right?
976,2017-09-29T15:56:24.000219,Orpha,shouldnt make a difference

976,2017-09-29T16:01:34.000070,Orpha,"he seems pretty new to python also, so i doubt he did anything crazy"
976,2017-09-29T16:02:57.000217,Mallie,"I told him to SO it, but if he doesn't want to I can"
976,2017-09-29T16:03:18.000150,Orpha,"yea, figured id try here first"
976,2017-09-29T16:03:34.000104,Mallie,"Totally fair, just figure get some more eyes on it since no one seems to have anything"
976,2017-09-29T16:05:51.000137,Orpha,"<@Antionette> since you can reproduce it, can you try one more time, but after the error don’t call dir(urllib) just call urllib.parse again?"
976,2017-09-29T16:06:03.000042,Antionette,"yeah tried that, it gets the attribute"
976,2017-09-29T16:06:09.000321,Orpha,ok
976,2017-09-29T16:06:14.000496,Orpha,cool / still weird
976,2017-09-29T16:07:46.000222,Orpha,and do you remember if you installed via package manager or from a download?
976,2017-09-29T16:09:07.000134,Antionette,package manager
976,2017-09-29T16:10:19.000534,Orpha,"question… does the same work with request, instead of parse"
976,2017-09-29T16:10:57.000020,Antionette,behaves the same as parse
976,2017-09-29T16:12:03.000169,Orpha,ok
976,2017-09-29T16:12:07.000267,Orpha,thanks
976,2017-09-29T16:12:39.000446,Antionette,do you get True for this?
976,2017-09-29T16:13:12.000120,Antionette,I'm assuming yes
976,2017-09-29T16:15:02.000125,Orpha,umm…
976,2017-09-29T16:15:19.000323,Orpha,wait
976,2017-09-29T16:15:20.000338,Orpha,lol
976,2017-09-29T16:15:21.000299,Orpha,typo
976,2017-09-29T16:16:08.000183,Orpha,`False`
976,2017-09-29T16:16:41.000297,Antionette,hmmm
976,2017-09-29T16:16:53.000179,Orpha,but that should be the same
976,2017-09-29T16:16:54.000094,Antionette,but then if you call `urllib.parse` it doesn't give the attribute error
976,2017-09-29T16:17:00.000502,Antionette,but then it becomes true right?
976,2017-09-29T16:17:06.000586,Orpha,as parse wont load for you until after the AttributeError
976,2017-09-29T16:17:22.000566,Antionette,right
976,2017-09-29T16:18:22.000514,Orpha,"the original question on this… parse, request, etc… were actually loading on the AttributeError for urllib.foo"
976,2017-09-29T16:18:53.000102,Orpha,its like the interpreter throws the error then loads everything just to make sure
976,2017-09-29T16:19:14.000639,Antionette,yeah I'm seeing the same behaviour
976,2017-09-29T16:19:53.000183,Antionette,"and just to double check, for you/the correct behviour is that you can access `urllib.parse` from the beginning?"
976,2017-09-29T16:20:01.000256,Orpha,no
976,2017-09-29T16:20:33.000022,Orpha,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(urllib)
['__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__path__', '__spec__']
&gt;&gt;&gt; urllib.foo

&gt;&gt;&gt; ```"
976,2017-09-29T16:20:34.000129,Antionette,ok so you have to explicitly import it
976,2017-09-29T16:20:40.000309,Orpha,thats what most of us are seeing
976,2017-09-29T16:21:00.000547,Orpha,dir(urllib) doesn’t change after the error
976,2017-09-29T16:22:28.000396,Antionette,so it seems to be on any error
976,2017-09-29T16:22:47.000377,Antionette,wait
976,2017-09-29T16:23:20.000551,Orpha,wth… import after error too? thats new
976,2017-09-29T16:23:25.000146,Orpha,<@Mallie> ^
976,2017-09-29T16:23:38.000519,Earline,"Does this happen for other modules, e.g. `logging` has a similar package structure to `urllib`, so what happens for
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import logging
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(logging)
&gt;&gt;&gt; logging.config
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir(logging)
```?"
976,2017-09-29T16:23:41.000273,Mallie,hah - so it's the exception that triggers the import?
976,2017-09-29T16:24:13.000122,Orpha,"no, he didn’t import urllib until after the error"
976,2017-09-29T16:24:28.000483,Orpha,<@Antionette> do that once more but call dir on urllib right after the error
976,2017-09-29T16:24:35.000094,Orpha,lets see if it loads with the modules
976,2017-09-29T16:24:58.000248,Antionette,without importing?
976,2017-09-29T16:25:13.000291,Orpha,"no, import urllib after error then call dir"
976,2017-09-29T16:25:29.000398,Orpha,see if parse is loaded before another error
976,2017-09-29T16:25:59.000348,Antionette,not sure if this is what you were looking for
976,2017-09-29T16:26:23.000118,Orpha,yea
976,2017-09-29T16:26:46.000047,Antionette,"well that makes sense, otherwise it would have given the attribute error in the above code"
976,2017-09-29T16:27:05.000148,Seema,<@Orpha> I'm here now
976,2017-09-29T16:27:08.000106,Antionette,the question is why is any error importing it
976,2017-09-29T16:27:14.000299,Orpha,yea
976,2017-09-29T16:27:17.000322,Orpha,pretty much
976,2017-09-29T16:27:39.000168,Orpha,there are a lot of why?‘s
976,2017-09-29T16:27:40.000329,Orpha,haha
976,2017-09-29T16:27:53.000003,Orpha,and i can’t reproduce that either
976,2017-09-29T16:28:19.000377,Mallie,"I have it written, just proofing it"
976,2017-09-29T16:28:29.000003,Orpha,with the newest updates?

976,2017-09-29T16:40:16.000184,Kiersten,"<@Antionette> So basically, it's a namespace package and somewhere along the line something else imports the actual urllib.parse and then it works?"
976,2017-09-29T16:40:41.000318,Antionette,Yeah its look like this system exception hook is importing all modules

976,2017-09-29T16:42:31.000187,Orpha,so apt-uninstall it and it should go away?

But generators do have a pretty straightforward behavior once you get used to them, so if you haven't read this yet, <https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators>, do. Conceptually, the shorthand is the same as writing that sort of example class they have, it's just the interpreter is doing the state tracking and iterator behavior definition for you."

I'm trying to clean up my code that I have for an application I'm building and make it a bit more object oriented and nicer looking, however, with the async task that's set to run I'm wondering what might be the best way to set it up. Should I instantiate the class that the background task is in then when everything is setup, run the task? Or have it outside of the class object?"

992,2017-10-02T00:33:44.000151,Myong,so it gives an error for it and I know why but I'm just attempting to figure it out
992,2017-10-02T00:34:39.000061,Signe,More detail?
992,2017-10-02T00:37:43.000059,Myong,One sec I'll put some small example together
992,2017-10-02T00:40:27.000116,Myong,"Actually, I fixed it. I just decided to go with one small class and keep the main object inline and out of a class so that the decorators which use that variable later do not throw errors."

992,2017-10-02T00:42:47.000023,Myong,"So in that snippet something like that would throw errors because bot wasn't initialized, I was just trying to figure out how to make it work"

I have a ton of short lived tasks executing as part of a chord with a callback afterwards.  Due to the way a chord works, each task needs to return a result, which is saved in the task key in redis.

Over the weekend, got this error message in redis: 

`Can't save in background: fork: Cannot allocate memory`, 

with corresponding errors in the celery workers:

```ResponseError: Command # 1 (SET celery-task-meta-26aa6a83-2238-4f49-b3ec-555be58bfd91 {""status"": ""SUCCESS"", ""traceback"": null, ""result"": ""True"", ""children"": []}) of pipeline caused error: MISCONF Redis is configured to save RDB snapshots, but is currently not able to persist on disk.

998,2017-10-02T12:13:25.000282,Marcelina,I've found creating helper functions has been helpful with that
998,2017-10-02T12:13:44.000762,Marcelina,But you are right that it has the potential to cause security concerns with poor data sanitzation
998,2017-10-02T12:15:08.000188,Marcelina,"I don't have the real data behind SQLAlchemy slow-downs, but if you profile, you'll see that each time you do a select for example, it has to take a general data structure in and output a string. Because it's so generic though, there seem to be a lot of extra calls"
998,2017-10-02T12:15:21.000081,Marcelina,Sounds like a good weekend project :slightly_smiling_face:
998,2017-10-02T12:17:40.000127,Rosamaria,"Interesting ok, thanks for the input guys. One more question, not super Flask relevant but:

Do you guys have a good resource / reference on best practices when writing a RESTful backend? 

To clarify, I'm wondering what most people do when 

* a required parameter was not sent
  - My decision so far has been to set the status code to `422`, but I don't know what the response JSON object should be... maybe `{}`?
* the required parameter that was sent was not found in the DB
  - My decision so far has been to set the status code to `404`, as the ID was not found, BUT again I don't know what the response JSON object should be..."
998,2017-10-02T12:18:09.000430,Marcelina,"For RESTful back-end, love both Flask and Eve"
998,2017-10-02T12:18:24.000396,Marcelina,Eve I've found forces you to be more precise with what you want
998,2017-10-02T12:18:40.000478,Marcelina,There's a whole schema declaration you're doing and it comes with a MongoDB back-end basically
998,2017-10-02T12:18:53.000400,Marcelina,Flask I've found has more flexibility
998,2017-10-02T12:19:04.000219,Rosamaria,"Oh, I guess I'm talking not specifically about libraries/frameworks, but literally what to do when those events occur"
998,2017-10-02T12:20:10.000520,Marcelina,This presentation was from FOREVER ago
998,2017-10-02T12:20:11.000331,Marcelina,<https://www.slideshare.net/MikePearce/api-anti-patterns-4920731>
998,2017-10-02T12:20:24.000298,Marcelina,But you might find some nuggets in there
998,2017-10-02T12:20:36.000381,Rosamaria,"Ok, thank you very much"
998,2017-10-02T12:20:41.000654,Rosamaria,This is the type of stuff I was looking for
998,2017-10-02T12:21:39.000368,Mallie,Is there a way to format links into text in slack? If there is it is lost on me.
998,2017-10-02T12:21:41.000563,Marcelina,<https://www.programmableweb.com/news/api-anti-patterns-how-to-avoid-common-rest-mistakes/2010/08/13>
998,2017-10-02T12:22:38.000244,Marcelina,That sums up his presentation much better - his slides were kind of all over the place
998,2017-10-02T12:25:53.000734,Meg,<@Mallie> no.
998,2017-10-02T12:27:02.000434,Meg,<@Rosamaria> this is a pretty good guide
998,2017-10-02T12:27:02.000734,Meg,<http://www.vinaysahni.com/best-practices-for-a-pragmatic-restful-api>
998,2017-10-02T12:27:57.000161,Marcelina,Ooo - I like yours better
998,2017-10-02T12:34:32.000009,Meg,any resources on best practices to filter with optional query parameters without making a mess of code?
998,2017-10-02T12:44:32.000120,Meg,I'm working on refactoring an api backend that is pretty messy
998,2017-10-02T12:45:03.000006,Meg,"downside, there's six possible query parameters I have to account for, and only one is required"
998,2017-10-02T12:46:17.000501,Mallie,<@Meg> What's it look like (if that is ok)?
998,2017-10-02T12:48:31.000366,Meg,"and that's _after_ I cleaned it up two years ago.  Before, it was far worse"
998,2017-10-02T12:52:16.000552,Meg,"at this point, I think its highly overcomplicated"
998,2017-10-02T12:52:33.000721,Meg,and might be a case of lipstick on a pig to move forward without re-evaluating
998,2017-10-02T13:06:15.000491,Mallie,"Well `request.GET` permits lookup by key - so why repack them just to check for the one necessary, then just unpack them again anyway? You could just `request.GET.get()` or `[string] in request.GET` and remove most of that top code I'd think. I would check for the required field and leave immediately without any other processing personally. Also, if you want to use **kwargs, you could provide a mapping between kwarg and value then just provide them if they exist, if you are interested in making it more terse, since you are just ANDing things in your filter and exclude cases e.g. 

```
d={'catalog__institution__unitid': 1, 'catalog__institution__name__icontains': 2, 'catalog__institution__status': None}
**dict((key, value) for key,value in d.items() if value)
```

Can't these be grouped into a `filter` too: `Q(catalog__status = 'Verified') &amp; Q(name = 'Catalog Home')`. I'd only add the verbosity of Q for OR"
998,2017-10-02T13:08:10.000283,Marcelina,"This section is the most mysterious to me ```    # More custom query for filters
    custom_query &amp;= Q(catalog__institution__state = state)
    custom_query &amp;= Q(Q(flags__gte = 5) &amp; Q(media_type = 'PDF')) | Q(media_type = 'Web') | Q(media_type = 'Multi-Part PDF')
    custom_query &amp;= Q(catalog__status = 'Verified') &amp; Q(name = 'Catalog Home') &amp; Q(catalog__cataloglink__name = 'Catalog Home')```"
998,2017-10-02T13:08:20.000430,Marcelina,It looks like some bitwise logic
998,2017-10-02T13:09:00.000352,Mallie,"In the Django ORM when working with querysets, the bitwise operators are overridden so you can do query building: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q-objects>"
998,2017-10-02T13:09:04.000015,Meg,"basically, I need to explicityly filter based on those fields"
998,2017-10-02T13:09:06.000041,Marcelina,Ahhh
998,2017-10-02T13:09:07.000393,Marcelina,Thanks
998,2017-10-02T13:09:22.000069,Mallie,I'm saying AND is encompassed fully in `filter` - if you need to OR you are stuck with `Q`
998,2017-10-02T13:09:53.000317,Meg,"and if you want to do a NOT query without using `exclude`, then you need to use a Q object"
998,2017-10-02T13:10:13.000487,Meg,appreciate the thoughts :slightly_smiling_face:
998,2017-10-02T13:13:02.000056,Mallie,Jupyter is browser-based right? Did you clear your cache when changing versions (new static files with same name?)
998,2017-10-02T13:13:26.000364,Mallie,Disclaimer: I've never used Jupyter
998,2017-10-02T13:14:39.000012,Nicol,"Yes, browser based. I didn't try with cache. Will do"
998,2017-10-02T13:15:19.000176,Nicol,Thanks a lot

998,2017-10-02T13:18:23.000410,Meg,nice!
998,2017-10-02T13:18:40.000323,Johana,the code is in a private repo so unfortunately cannot share.
998,2017-10-02T13:18:48.000121,Meg,understood
999,2017-10-02T12:02:24.000289,Rosamaria,"I'm assuming most people here use something like SQL Alchemy opposed to writing raw SQL, is that correct?"
999,2017-10-02T12:04:08.000571,Mallie,"It varies. There is SQLAlchemy, someone just brought up Pony ORM but there was talk of python-mysql (name?) the other day. Others use Django. I would say ORM is probably more preferred, but that is just based on frequency of chatters."
1000,2017-10-02T12:34:47.000403,Meg,can be general or django-specific
1001,2017-10-02T13:06:43.000426,Marcelina,"You might like `filter_params.get(field[5], None)` rather than your ternaries"
1002,2017-10-02T13:31:08.000145,Nicol,"<@Mallie> Din't help, but thanks anyway!"
1002,2017-10-02T13:31:47.000550,Mallie,Had to try! :thumbsup:
1003,2017-10-02T17:51:43.000054,Marcelina,"I work for a company that uses a lot of the python scientific packages. We use docker containers for running these packages currently. There are two issues I'm trying to figure out how to solve. First, what's the common methodology for storing/accessing large data locally? The large data is stored in the cloud - we are examining how that is stored right now, but it could be any back-end.
`from data_loader import some_data_set`. would be the ideal line. My thought was to do a staged caching mechanism, e.g. if the data exists locally, use it. If it doesn't, pull it. Has anyone ever stumbled across a design pattern similar to this?

Second, since everything runs inside a docker container, would it really be so wrong to, on program start, if we are not running inside our docker image, start it and redirect everything to run inside it?"
1003,2017-10-02T17:52:54.000115,Marcelina,"3rd, does anyone have any lessons learned from running their own PyPI server privately?"
1003,2017-10-02T17:53:04.000341,Marcelina,"Finally, does anyone think I ask too many questions?"
1003,2017-10-02T18:07:20.000041,Marcelina,<@Lawerence> Could you rephrase/expand a little
1003,2017-10-02T18:07:20.000434,Marcelina,?

1003,2017-10-02T18:13:47.000028,Meg,<@Marcelina> interesting questions :slightly_smiling_face:
1003,2017-10-02T18:14:18.000138,Meg,about the only issue I could see with you doing a staging mechanism is to ensure there’s enough storage locally before starting the download
1003,2017-10-02T18:14:41.000196,Meg,"second, I could see that being a good use pattern"
1003,2017-10-02T18:14:56.000326,Meg,"third, sorry, can’t say"
1003,2017-10-02T18:14:57.000148,Marcelina,"That was my thought - and that was why I was wondering about running outside docker because inside docker, you got no idea how much is remaining"
1003,2017-10-02T18:15:19.000216,Meg,"with docker, you can symlink to external resources, correct?"
1003,2017-10-02T18:15:29.000103,Marcelina,You can mount resources externally
1003,2017-10-02T18:15:40.000084,Marcelina,"But as a container, it's not really aware of the system space remaining"
1003,2017-10-02T18:16:00.000265,Meg,ah ok
1003,2017-10-02T18:16:11.000067,Marcelina,I think there's some workarounds I can do there
1003,2017-10-02T18:16:12.000171,Meg,"so, seems like you’d have to ensure creation of the container"
1003,2017-10-02T18:16:12.000358,Marcelina,Admittedly
1003,2017-10-02T18:16:19.000120,Meg,and then mount it
1003,2017-10-02T18:16:25.000111,Meg,somewhat complex there
1003,2017-10-02T18:16:43.000211,Marcelina,hrms
1003,2017-10-02T18:16:44.000418,Marcelina,ok
1003,2017-10-02T18:16:50.000370,Meg,I’d probaby go to the <#C22DMH61M|devops> channel for that
1003,2017-10-02T18:16:58.000238,Marcelina,fair enough
1003,2017-10-02T18:17:15.000101,Meg,since there are some docker people there and thats usually where this kind of topic is discussed :slightly_smiling_face:
1003,2017-10-02T18:17:21.000166,Marcelina,I gotcha
1003,2017-10-02T18:17:58.000060,Marcelina,But the data access pattern
1003,2017-10-02T18:18:09.000054,Marcelina,I just can't think of another method
1003,2017-10-02T18:18:25.000216,Meg,does this data change often
1003,2017-10-02T18:18:28.000353,Marcelina,Yes
1003,2017-10-02T18:18:33.000134,Meg,hmm
1003,2017-10-02T18:18:38.000307,Marcelina,Well
1003,2017-10-02T18:18:42.000075,Marcelina,Depends on the set
1003,2017-10-02T18:18:44.000135,Marcelina,But assume yes
1003,2017-10-02T18:18:45.000007,Meg,"otherwise, I’d suggest an in-company dockerhub or something"
1003,2017-10-02T18:18:52.000118,Marcelina,We use quay
1003,2017-10-02T18:19:01.000280,Marcelina,And I thought about packing the data into images
1003,2017-10-02T18:19:03.000015,Meg,where you can create and deploy containers for others to retrieve and run
1003,2017-10-02T18:19:41.000085,Marcelina,"Yea - but the issue you'll run into there is that on OSX, there is a default 64GB cap on docker volumes - but another question for the <#C22DMH61M|devops>"

1013,2017-10-03T15:22:25.000553,Seema,So I guess my next question is...list comprehension is preferable to dict because knowledge of key-value:pair is needed in dict and it isn't in list...?
1013,2017-10-03T15:23:43.000554,Johana,i wouldn’t say it is preferable. it depend on what you are doing. if you need a list of items a list comp is the way to go to create one.
1013,2017-10-03T15:26:24.000571,Seema,"okay, thanks.  (I think I need to read a lot more code)"
1013,2017-10-03T15:28:23.000229,Seema,can the value in a key-value be a Class?
1013,2017-10-03T15:28:40.000092,Meg,yes
1013,2017-10-03T15:29:10.000469,Meg,"but the key cannot be a list, dict or set, or any mutable structure"
1013,2017-10-03T15:29:33.000216,Meg,"so, you can use a tuple as a dict key"
1013,2017-10-03T15:30:51.000292,Seema,"the sounds messier, in general, than lists.  At least in this case.  Overall, I'm trying to grok why choices are made."
1013,2017-10-03T15:31:50.000645,Meg,"basically, use a list or tuple where you'd prefer accessing an item by an index"
1013,2017-10-03T15:32:08.000263,Meg,use a dict if you would prefer accessing an item with a specific key
1013,2017-10-03T15:32:26.000384,Meg,"the first, you'd pretty much have to iterate over the structure and do comparisons before doing something"
1013,2017-10-03T15:32:55.000102,Meg,"but with a dict, you can just do `item = dict_struct.get('key_name', None)` and get either the value for the key, or a `NoneType`"

1014,2017-10-03T16:21:08.000457,Antionette,if you're expecting numbers larger than that you will need to go to something like big int

1015,2017-10-03T22:48:36.000107,Arlene,I guess its that simple. Idk if i should add any error handling etc. but ...
1015,2017-10-03T22:48:38.000068,Arlene,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1015,2017-10-03T22:49:23.000016,Bruno,"possibly a try/catch if the sed exits with an error. but other than that, yea. should be pretty simple."
1015,2017-10-03T22:49:40.000060,Bruno,ive still never really had the need for commit hooks.
1015,2017-10-03T22:50:38.000174,Arlene,"this is for our dev team, because we make a lot of changes in thsoe directories or we new stuff, and we need to display the last modified date to the front end, so i figured we might as well automate it, instead of hardcoding it everytime we make changes to the file"
1015,2017-10-03T22:50:44.000177,Arlene,so this is my use case for now.
1015,2017-10-03T22:50:59.000069,Arlene,but other than that another use case would be to run tests before commiting but hey lol

I have a very simple function below which relies on psutil. When I try to call it I see unexpected results.. 0.0% - However I am running the linux binary `stress` on 1 cpu for 60 seconds which consumes 100% cpu usage 

```def get_cpu_usage(pid):

I have a twitter API streamer running asynchronously alongside a discord bot, also running with async. Now, when I receive information from twitter, the stream is set to call a function. Now the function it calls is not set as async or anything like that. So my question is, when I call a synchronous function within an async function, is that no long asynchronous?"
1018,2017-10-04T01:12:18.000102,Marcie,"<@Myong> correct, you're only getting async behaviour when you yield"
1018,2017-10-04T01:13:44.000099,Myong,"<@Marcie> Okay, now it seems that tweepy uses `Threading.py` for async. I am wondering if I can just throw the whole TweepyStreamer object into an `asyncio` loop to get async behavior and as for the two functions I have just mark those with `async def` and use await for return values?"
1018,2017-10-04T01:15:58.000016,Myong,This issue is basically I have a bot for Discord that has it's own loop so when it runs it's blocking
1018,2017-10-04T01:16:37.000146,Myong,I need to get the stream to run while the the discord bot is also running
1018,2017-10-04T01:17:47.000184,Myong,Now the bot event loop is already making use of `asyncio`. Do you think that simply by putting the streamer as a whole into an event loop will fix the problem?
1018,2017-10-04T02:11:51.000063,Myong,Seems like if I want to run a blocking task I have to use run in executor

1021,2017-10-04T11:19:08.000307,Florene,"<@Meg> Okay, Thanks..!"
1021,2017-10-04T11:22:50.000239,Florene,"<@Meg> Do you have any idea about Google-Cloud problem i'm facing ?
It seems that it's causing because of the library being not-thread-safe

Correct me if i'm wrong."
1021,2017-10-04T11:23:00.000577,Meg,"nope, sorry"
1021,2017-10-04T11:23:16.000265,Meg,"don’t use google cloud at all, its all digital ocean or aws for me"
1021,2017-10-04T11:26:06.000365,Florene,oh Ok :smile:
1021,2017-10-04T11:27:09.000436,Florene,"but sad to know that the problem of boto3 is causing problems at my side &amp; i am not able to bypass or workaround that..
kinda stops my work.."
1021,2017-10-04T11:32:33.000653,Mallie,<@Florene> Are you sharing a single boto3 resource across threads? The docs say not to do that: <http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/resources.html#multithreading-multiprocessing>
1021,2017-10-04T11:34:03.000530,Florene,"<@Mallie>: actually i have a single python module &amp; the module init will have a connection aws-resources using boto3 &amp; the same connection variable is used by all the operations
and the problem is occurring when i trigger multiple snapshots, wherein the single client-connection would be used to perform multiple operations.."
1021,2017-10-04T11:36:21.000656,Mallie,"<@Florene> Yeah I mean I had to read an issue or two and google for a few min (they should be clearer about this) but I think it definitely isn't thread safe, so if you are using the same connection, it's not going to work out for you"
1021,2017-10-04T11:36:39.000193,Mallie,Comment in github that Resource should be made thread safe (opinion) is from 2016 and is still open
1021,2017-10-04T11:38:03.000222,Florene,"ohh
you're telling this for google api library ?"
1021,2017-10-04T11:38:08.000573,Meg,no
1021,2017-10-04T11:38:10.000042,Meg,boto3
1021,2017-10-04T11:38:24.000105,Florene,"oh
this is how i create connection in my code:

```
        self.ec2 = boto3.resource(""ec2"", region_name=region,
                                  aws_access_key_id=accesskey,

                           aws_secret_access_key=secretkey)
```"
1021,2017-10-04T11:38:25.000413,Meg,this is nothing to do with google api
1021,2017-10-04T11:38:32.000400,Meg,its all how you’re using boto3
1021,2017-10-04T11:38:37.000268,Florene,and i use self.ec2 at all places wherever and whenever needed
1021,2017-10-04T11:39:44.000596,Florene,<@Mallie> Could you check whether what you've mentioned as not to be used is same as how i'm using/doing it
1021,2017-10-04T11:40:06.000568,Meg,all you’re showing there is how your instanciating the connection
1021,2017-10-04T11:40:09.000304,Meg,not how you’re using it
1021,2017-10-04T11:40:43.000395,Mallie,"Like <@Meg> said we aren't looking at that code, we are responding to
&gt; when i fire multi-threaded calls using boto3
&gt; i'm getting boto3 error"
1021,2017-10-04T11:41:03.000373,Mallie,"And
&gt; i have a single python module &amp; the module init will have a connection aws-resources using boto3 &amp; the same connection variable is used by all the operations"
1021,2017-10-04T11:41:57.000347,Mallie,"It is _not_ thread safe, you need to initialize your resource in each thread if you want to do multi-threaded stuff"

1021,2017-10-04T11:43:57.000111,Florene,"oh okay...
yeah
thats what the link says"
1021,2017-10-04T11:44:25.000053,Florene,and i think the problem is same for google-problem as well
1021,2017-10-04T11:44:35.000686,Florene,it seems because of multi-threading only :disappointed:
1021,2017-10-04T11:44:43.000715,Florene,i use same connection for multiple operatoins..
1021,2017-10-04T11:48:03.000592,Florene,<@Mallie>: could you please provide the issue id for thread-safe issue mention?
1021,2017-10-04T11:49:20.000091,Mallie,Yeah sure: <https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/268>
1021,2017-10-04T11:50:16.000136,Patty,They also mention in their docs for multithreading to create a new resource instance for each thread or process: <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/resources.html#multithreading-multiprocessing> e: beaten by <@Mallie> a bit ago :slightly_smiling_face:
1021,2017-10-04T11:51:21.000747,Florene,"thank you so much <@Mallie> <@Patty> 
let me know if you think the same for google-library, thanks a ton _in advance_ .."
1021,2017-10-04T11:52:29.000328,Meg,"uh, what?  this applies to the code, not deployment environment"
1021,2017-10-04T11:54:09.000209,Florene,"<@Meg>: didn't get you, sorry"
1021,2017-10-04T11:55:43.000380,Meg,google-library?
1021,2017-10-04T11:55:58.000672,Meg,"&gt;let me know if you think the same for google-library, thanks a ton _in advance_ .."
1021,2017-10-04T11:57:50.000837,Florene,"i meant - i faces few problems on using `google-api-python-client` library &amp; i think, the problems that i'm facing is because of the library not being thread-safe
so wanted your thoughts/confirmation on that one..."
1021,2017-10-04T11:58:28.000735,Florene,"the problem i mentioned above, with stack
let me know if you are not able to find that"
1021,2017-10-04T12:04:49.000252,Patty,<@Florene> <https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/thread_safety>
1021,2017-10-04T12:05:29.000736,Florene,"yeah
<@Patty> even now - i just found the same
(y)"
1021,2017-10-04T12:06:39.000702,Florene,Need to check what extra handling would be needed to make it thread-safe for my usage..
1021,2017-10-04T12:09:43.000158,Patty,It won’t be thread-safe given the library it’s built on. Every request will need to have a new httplib2 object
1021,2017-10-04T12:10:19.000029,Mallie,"&gt; Need to check what extra handling would be needed to make it thread-safe for my usage..
Don't, that is the wrong path here."
1021,2017-10-04T12:10:42.000546,Mallie,"Those are not easy problems, you should adjust your program to use the library within the restriction of not being thread safe."
1021,2017-10-04T12:13:43.000088,Florene,"oh
should i not try to handle the issue ?
i mean - say - i have multiple requests coming in &amp; then i should serve as much requests as possible
and to achieve what i was thinking was to create session/connection whenever the request comes up &amp; processing would happen differently for each requests and each of them will have their own session/connection, right ?"
1021,2017-10-04T12:14:45.000315,Patty,"basically, if you are using modules that aren’t thread safe, then do not multithread or process them"
1021,2017-10-04T12:16:03.000019,Florene,"ok.
but that also means - the request serving would be serial &amp; nothing can happen in parallel, right ?"
1021,2017-10-04T12:18:04.000505,Mallie,"What <@Patty> is saying is don't use the _modules_ incorrectly. You are free to create multithreaded code, but don't use non-threadsafe components across threads."
1021,2017-10-04T12:18:37.000029,Mallie,Just create a new boto3 resource for each thread if that is what you want to do
1021,2017-10-04T12:19:02.000144,Florene,"okay..
got it..."
1021,2017-10-04T12:19:14.000658,Florene,Tnx
1021,2017-10-04T12:31:57.000175,Christin,I just want the third one that kind of separates the black dots and green dots (Matplotlib)
1021,2017-10-04T14:24:28.000274,Orpha,<@Arlene> hope you found an answer. Sorry I was at a show last night. 
1021,2017-10-04T14:47:30.000630,Arlene,<@Orpha> all good. It looks good. 
1021,2017-10-04T14:47:36.000606,Arlene,Tha KS for the help with sed

1022,2017-10-04T12:45:00.000061,Dominick,"I'm using `Atom` and trying to do a ""Find in Project"". Some searches do return results and some (which are in my project for sure) do not return results. I've disabled `Exclude VCS Ignored Paths`. I'm on Windows 7 and the newest `Atom`. Has anyone ever run across this?"
1022,2017-10-04T12:50:12.000235,Dominick,Actually it's whatever :slightly_smiling_face:. I just found out about `grepWin` - it's super useful and free.
1022,2017-10-04T12:56:16.000293,Junita,<@Dominick> any chance these files are in .gitignore or something like that?
1022,2017-10-04T12:56:49.000722,Dominick,<@Junita> nope - plus I think that's what disabling `Exclude VCS Ignored Paths` does...causes it to look in every folder even if its in `.gitignore`
1023,2017-10-04T14:57:12.000394,Seema,"I have some learning questions if someone has some time.
```some_list_comprehension = [
    temp_variable.field_of_interest
    for temp_variable in a_callable
    if temp_variable.my_question_here is some condition
]```
First, conceptually are there any problems with the template?"
1023,2017-10-04T15:01:50.000469,Frieda,"no, that's correct for a list comp"
1023,2017-10-04T15:02:19.000277,Seema,"thanks, my question is about if temp_variable.my_question_here..."
1023,2017-10-04T15:03:03.000250,Seema,does Python know whether it's looking for a key or a field or a whatever after the period by inferring from the expression/a_callable  ?
1023,2017-10-04T15:04:42.000634,Seema,"I would imagine generally one would iterate over something searching for say a field in a class or in a value for a given key AND that Python looks at the ""in"" statement to determine how/what it is looking for.  Am I imagining correctly?"
1023,2017-10-04T15:06:47.000456,Patty,"For the most part, Python doesn’t do dot accessors like JavaScript"
1023,2017-10-04T15:07:01.000393,Patty,"So, for a dictionary, you would need to do `dict['key']`"
1023,2017-10-04T15:08:47.000077,Mallie,"To add on to what <@Patty> said, in `temp_variable.my_question_here` `my_question_here` is an attribute, and if it does not exist you will get `AttributeError`, see doc for `getattr()` and `setattr()` to handle getting/setting attributes by name"
1023,2017-10-04T15:09:06.000320,Mallie,It's not a key/value pair
1023,2017-10-04T15:10:23.000297,Seema,I'm thinking that I keep seeing list to list comprehension and that it's more about what I've been seeing than what Python can do.
1023,2017-10-04T15:11:06.000109,Seema,"Continuing on the attribute part, is that why I can have a list of Class instances and iterate through the attributes of the Classes in the list?"
1023,2017-10-04T15:11:36.000200,Mallie,Yeah because each `temp_variable` has a `my_question_here`
1023,2017-10-04T15:11:42.000424,Mallie,"If it didn't, you'd get the exception"
1023,2017-10-04T15:12:49.000478,Seema,I don't think I'm crystal clear on what is an attribute vs field.  Time to dig into the docs.
1023,2017-10-04T15:13:31.000330,Seema,Thanks for the help <@Frieda> <@Patty> <@Mallie>
1023,2017-10-04T15:15:15.000462,Mallie,<@Seema> I could be wrong but I don't think Python ever explicitly refers to those as fields. Are you referring to fields in the Django sense of things? They define and heavily leverage that term.
1023,2017-10-04T15:17:27.000685,Seema,"In a class, there are a set of class ""things"", dunders, methods, class lists,etc.  I honestly don't have the confidence to say what the exact name is - in the terminology sense - of each of those things."
1023,2017-10-04T15:17:39.000784,Frieda,"yeah, there's really no such Python thing as a ""field"", AFAIK"
1023,2017-10-04T15:17:56.000299,Seema,What's the proper name for self.__thing__ ?
1023,2017-10-04T15:18:00.000303,Frieda,classes only have two member types. attributes and methods
1023,2017-10-04T15:18:15.000265,Frieda,attributes are variables that are scoped to a class/instance
1023,2017-10-04T15:18:20.000404,Frieda,methods are functions that are scoped to a class/instance
1023,2017-10-04T15:18:50.000390,Seema,are there any weird edge cases like a Class havinga  Class or is attributes and methods only?
1023,2017-10-04T15:19:21.000249,Frieda,a class having a class... I can't think of any way to do that that wouldn't make it an attribute
1023,2017-10-04T15:19:33.000135,Seema,"attribute and method it is, thanks"
1023,2017-10-04T15:19:44.000397,Frieda,"you can't really have a nested class, like you could have a nested function"
1023,2017-10-04T15:20:00.000360,Frieda,"classes have inheritance, of course, but that's not the same"
1023,2017-10-04T15:20:35.000409,Suellen,"<@Frieda> 
```
class MyModel(db.Model):

1023,2017-10-04T15:21:19.000087,Suellen,It's a somewhat common way to store meta attributes in some ORMs
1023,2017-10-04T15:21:24.000666,Frieda,sure but that's handled through some behind-the-scenes abc magic that actually nests it into an attribute
1023,2017-10-04T15:21:30.000226,Frieda,`MyModel._meta` usually
1023,2017-10-04T15:21:48.000582,Frieda,"it's not a plain-ol-Python-object, AFAIK"
1023,2017-10-04T15:22:15.000197,Suellen,works in REPL :confused:
1023,2017-10-04T15:22:24.000554,Frieda,hmm. very well
1023,2017-10-04T15:22:34.000432,Frieda,"OK, while _possible_, it's _uncommon_. how about that? :smile:"
1023,2017-10-04T15:22:38.000195,Suellen,Maybe old-style classes from py2 couldn't do it?
1023,2017-10-04T15:23:35.000452,Suellen,"&gt; while _possible_, it's _uncommon_.
Yeah, but I wish it was more common."
1023,2017-10-04T15:24:17.000591,Frieda,"re: py2, maybe? re: wishing it was more common, I'm not sure how I feel about that. I kinda like things to be flatter"
1023,2017-10-04T15:24:46.000433,Suellen,Flat is indeed better than nested.. But it just looks so cute and simple!
1023,2017-10-04T15:25:13.000139,Suellen,"I mean, you know what it does right away, without even having worked with nested classes before."
1023,2017-10-04T15:25:49.000262,Frieda,"eh, you might be surprised on that ""you know what it does right away"" thing"

In my code, i create connection to google-cloud-compute by creating object like below:
```
compute = discovery.build(""compute"", ""v1"", credentials=credentials)
```

if i create `discovery.build` for each object ( as in for each request ), that would involve concurrent processing of Cloud Resources, using different resources AND 
with this - would it not fail ? in case if there are lot of requests ?
should there be a limit on how many `discovery.build` my code should fork ?
or there is no limit ?

same question can also be put up as :Should i use counting semaphore or something of that sort ?
To avoid creating n number of `discovery.build` objects. ?"

1026,2017-10-05T03:12:12.000257,Tatum,"Hey guys, what technical approach would you recommend to the following situations:
My web app has notifications. When a certain global thing is created (e.g new feature added), I want every user to receive a notification.
I’m thinking of passing this message (that a new thing was created) to my `notifications` service, which would use the `Process` class to create a new process and run the function which would iterate through all the users there. Is this alright?"
1026,2017-10-05T05:55:34.000230,Meg,<@Tatum> I’d just use an async task queue to do that for you
1026,2017-10-05T05:56:10.000047,Tatum,Ah but I’d run it in a server which already uses some
1026,2017-10-05T05:56:26.000317,Tatum,I figured there’s no sense to add more when I could just spawn another process

1026,2017-10-05T05:57:37.000057,Meg,celery has the concept of workers

1026,2017-10-05T05:59:35.000139,Tatum,Talk about over-engineering
1026,2017-10-05T05:59:51.000332,Meg,"now, you’d just have to have your client-side do a poll on an interval to check for notifications"
1026,2017-10-05T05:59:52.000198,Tatum,"Thanks for clearing this up, I had a hunch it wasn’t the right approach"
1026,2017-10-05T05:59:56.000003,Meg,:slightly_smiling_face:
1026,2017-10-05T06:01:12.000248,Meg,"somehow, the guy got his version running moderately well, but it didn’t handle issues very well and would consistently crash.  One of the first things I did was bring in Celery into the project and migrate everything over"
1026,2017-10-05T06:01:44.000085,Tatum,Yeah that’s the thing right? Handling errors and reporting back/retrying adequately
1026,2017-10-05T06:01:49.000081,Meg,"_much_ more reliable, and you’ve already passed the third hurdle"
1026,2017-10-05T06:01:51.000244,Meg,exactly
1026,2017-10-05T06:02:29.000426,Meg,that’s the difference between a toy project and something that’s production-ready: how it handles things you don’t expect
1026,2017-10-05T06:02:57.000421,Meg,"so, one area I’m unclear on"
1026,2017-10-05T06:03:09.000207,Meg,are you using polling on the client to check for updates?
1026,2017-10-05T06:03:19.000384,Tatum,the client as in who?
1026,2017-10-05T06:03:22.000270,Tatum,the one spawning the task?
1026,2017-10-05T06:03:51.000273,Meg,"no. you have a web app, so I assume its consuming an API"
1026,2017-10-05T06:03:59.000004,Meg,both browser and mobile capable
1026,2017-10-05T06:04:08.000010,Tatum,oh that’s a whole other separate thing
1026,2017-10-05T06:04:12.000179,Meg,how are you looking for updates in that?
1026,2017-10-05T06:04:25.000263,Meg,because you can have the notifications in the server
1026,2017-10-05T06:04:31.000374,Tatum,there’s a specific notifications server which accepts websockets
1026,2017-10-05T06:04:39.000175,Meg,:thumbsup:
1026,2017-10-05T06:04:42.000227,Tatum,it is connected to the main app through RabbitMQ
1026,2017-10-05T06:04:59.000361,Tatum,"and is listening for notifications, once it receives one it checks if the recipient is connected and if he is - he receives a notif"
1026,2017-10-05T06:05:20.000004,Meg,good idea
1026,2017-10-05T06:05:26.000248,Meg,and you’ve thought it through
1026,2017-10-05T06:05:28.000174,Tatum,so what the celery task would do is create the `Notification` object and maybe send a message through rabbitmq
1026,2017-10-05T06:05:43.000082,Meg,are you using rabbit as the backend for celery?
1026,2017-10-05T06:05:47.000139,Tatum,yeah
1026,2017-10-05T06:05:51.000328,Meg,ouch…
1026,2017-10-05T06:05:57.000411,Tatum,"they’re two separate instances though, methinks"
1026,2017-10-05T06:06:02.000260,Tatum,"why, whats wrong with that"
1026,2017-10-05T06:06:04.000101,Meg,I really wouldn’t reccommend it
1026,2017-10-05T06:06:10.000187,Meg,not advised in the docs
1026,2017-10-05T06:06:15.000274,Tatum,wow really
1026,2017-10-05T06:06:15.000342,Meg,redis is more stable
1026,2017-10-05T06:06:21.000130,Tatum,"I’ll need to revisit them, then"
1026,2017-10-05T06:06:38.000202,Tatum,This started out as a hackathon project and my initial idea was to just get celery working
1026,2017-10-05T06:06:42.000084,Meg,I used rabbit as both the broker and backend in the first iteration
1026,2017-10-05T06:07:04.000078,Meg,"what ended up happening, it was storing the results in memory, as well as the jobs"
1026,2017-10-05T06:07:15.000343,Tatum,and they got lost? :smile:
1026,2017-10-05T06:07:20.000001,Meg,and eventually everything clogged up so the workers weren’t picking up new jobs
1026,2017-10-05T06:07:33.000195,Meg,"yep, and server crashed, everything was lost"
1026,2017-10-05T06:07:51.000374,Tatum,"wow, how is that scenario not handled"
1026,2017-10-05T06:08:18.000306,Tatum,"it’s not that hard to predict it clogging up and eating all the memory, wonder why Celery hasn’t done anything about it"
1026,2017-10-05T06:08:31.000118,Tatum,AFAIA RabbitMQ has something like durable queues which store the data ?
1026,2017-10-05T06:09:23.000412,Meg,<https://denibertovic.com/posts/celery-best-practices/>
1026,2017-10-05T06:09:37.000285,Meg,"maybe they have, with 4.x"
1026,2017-10-05T06:09:44.000173,Meg,I’mm using 3.1.x

1026,2017-10-05T06:10:38.000369,Tatum,Thanks for the information :slightly_smiling_face:
1026,2017-10-05T06:12:02.000352,Meg,"so, I moved to redis for result storage"
1026,2017-10-05T06:12:18.000352,Meg,"since that’s basically what its built for: fast, concurrent key-value storage"
1026,2017-10-05T06:12:38.000372,Tatum,"wait, result storage?"
1026,2017-10-05T06:12:46.000245,Tatum,As in the results of a task?
1026,2017-10-05T06:12:56.000093,Meg,"no, return of task"
1026,2017-10-05T06:13:22.000173,Meg,"eg, task state, return values, etc"
1026,2017-10-05T06:14:06.000174,Tatum,"wow, look what I use"

1026,2017-10-05T06:15:27.000342,Meg,"gotcha.  I use redis for that, mainly because there are alot of short-term tasks to execute"
1026,2017-10-05T06:15:52.000291,Meg,"if I were to use that, the writes to db would be significant"
1026,2017-10-05T06:16:17.000048,Meg,I do have tasks that write to the database
1026,2017-10-05T06:16:46.000227,Meg,"but they do a query and update inside the task, and that’s for the more infrequent, longer-running tasks"
1026,2017-10-05T06:17:55.000382,Tatum,mine are long-running ish
1026,2017-10-05T06:18:08.000182,Tatum,might be minutes too

1027,2017-10-05T07:51:46.000250,Lemuel,"I want to take a screenshot of whole screen in python which is doable(feasible) to me. But if i want to take screenshot of a desired clipped area like the picture shown below means first of all, user should select(clip) a region using mouse pointer and then take screenshot of that area. So i want to say that how to clip a portion of an image in a clipboard?


NOTE: I have found some packages like ""clipboard"" and ""pyperclip"" but i couldn't understand how to clip an image? Help me

I got a code but it shows to clip only text. What modifications should be made in it to clip a desired area of an image.
    

    import clipboard
    clipboard.copy(""abc"") 
    text = clipboard.paste()

1027,2017-10-05T08:13:20.000225,Meg,you've explained very little in your question.

1027,2017-10-05T08:14:05.000175,Lemuel,check the sample code
1027,2017-10-05T08:23:24.000221,Marcie,"<@Lemuel> you're going to have to stick to reading more documentation, there's quite a lot of work to capture a region of screen including finding the OS specific solution that isn't really a simple question to answer"

1027,2017-10-05T09:02:54.000134,Vada,"but I also need to explain to you that these are innapropriate things to say, especially on an English speaking forum"
1027,2017-10-05T09:03:12.000149,Lemuel,so tell me the correct word?
1027,2017-10-05T09:04:05.000197,Vada,"In my opinion there is no correct replacement, you simply do not need to use any pronouns. simply ""i have explained the question, did nothing else"" is enough"
1027,2017-10-05T09:04:28.000008,Vada,"The closest correlate in english would be Sir/Ma'm, but neither are appropriate in this context"
1027,2017-10-05T09:04:48.000290,Lemuel,ok...means you do not want respect.
1027,2017-10-05T09:05:21.000375,Lemuel,"but sir, answer my question with the help of suitable sample example."
1027,2017-10-05T09:05:35.000433,Vada,My answer is not what you are looking for
1027,2017-10-05T09:06:02.000128,Vada,"And it is not that I do not want respect, it is that English naturally uses a respectful tone (e.g. You is the respectful form of the 2nd person)"
1027,2017-10-05T09:06:13.000171,Vada,We dropped the less respectful stuff centuries ago
1027,2017-10-05T09:09:09.000330,Vada,"<@Lemuel> There is a link at the top of this channel: <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask>

I suggest you read it.

I understand you would like us to help you solve this problem, and we would love to help you. As a result each of us has a duty.

Your duty is to do as much research and work as is possible into the problem area - to really try to understand it and attempt more solutions than simply `clipboard.copy(""abc"")`.

You need to gain a real understanding for the problem you are facing and come up with a plan or two to tackle it - and then attempt those plans. Once you have done that, if you still have issues, you should come to us. Explain what you've tried and, as <@Meg> explained, tell us what roadblock you've hit and why you think you've hit it.

Our duty then is to try and point you in the direction of resources which can help you with the problem - or to explain bugs you've introduced that we can see (because you should share your code so we can see).

If you do not have a coherent or complete plan, or lack the understanding required - we point you in the direction of resources to help you. This is what we have done so far.

What we will not do is solve your issues for you. Firstly because you will not learn as a programmer, your own progression will suffer, and we would not have really helped you in the long term. Secondly, because you are not paying us and we do not have time to solve everyones issues - this is not a crowdsourced development platform."
1027,2017-10-05T09:09:57.000054,Vada,"You have asked for help from us, which is fine. We have offered suggestions to help you help yourself."
1027,2017-10-05T09:10:17.000745,Vada,Show us you have taken that on board and have tried instead of dismissing it
1027,2017-10-05T09:10:45.000315,Vada,"If you feel you have spent too much time on the problem, take a break and come back another time when you feel ready to try again."
1028,2017-10-05T10:44:22.000336,Meghan,"Saw this function in a library I use. Curious as to what exactly happens here.

```def redispatch(obj, device_type, session_prep=True):
    """"""Dynamically change Netmiko object's class to proper class.
    Generally used with terminal_server device_type when you need to redispatch after interacting
    with terminal server.
    """"""
    new_class = ssh_dispatcher(device_type)
    obj.device_type = device_type
    obj.__class__ = new_class
    if session_prep:
        obj.session_preparation()```

obj is having it's __class__ changed to a new class. What happens when this line is executed? Is it something along the lines of `obj = NewClass()` and in the __init__ will run? Would the init be skipped since this doesn't seem to be instantiating a new instance of an object?"
1028,2017-10-05T10:47:02.000179,Meghan,"`ssh_dispatcher` returns reference to a class in the above code, not an instance of the class."
1028,2017-10-05T11:22:11.000415,Mallie,"<@Meghan> It simply changes what `__class__` is, I am quite certain the `__init__` would not be run, since, as you correctly pointed out, this happens when an instance is created."
1028,2017-10-05T11:23:19.000107,Mallie,My guess is that `obj.session_preparation()` sets whatever instance properties are needed that differentiates this class from the original class and the idea is to reduce overhead (so rather than instantiating a new object with all of the data that is needed from this object).
1028,2017-10-05T11:27:14.000725,Meghan,I guess I had not imagined that being a thing. May have to give it a try some time.
1028,2017-10-05T11:29:03.000340,Sirena,seems like it would be a delicate task to make sure `obj.session_preparation()` does everything right. Presumably the old and new classes are expected to be _quite_ similar
1028,2017-10-05T11:29:24.000444,Meghan,"Yeah, everything is inherited from one class."
1028,2017-10-05T11:30:03.000333,Meghan,It looks like the session_preparation method does stuff like disabling paging and entering into enable mode.
1028,2017-10-05T11:30:32.000533,Meghan,If the class had instance variables that were different i guess they would include them in that method.
1028,2017-10-05T11:31:11.000262,Kym,"Good evening guys, has anyone ever had the weird problem that execution stops while instantiating an object but throws no errors?"
1028,2017-10-05T11:31:24.000164,Kym,It's killing me:
1028,2017-10-05T11:31:34.000450,Meghan,I would guess something in that object is blocking indefinitely or has an infinite loop.
1028,2017-10-05T11:31:50.000897,Kym,As far as I can see it doesn't
1028,2017-10-05T11:31:55.000272,Sirena,depends? what is in your `__init__()`?
1028,2017-10-05T11:32:48.000143,Kym,main: instantiate object x: x__init__(xmlobject) parses xmlobject and assigns self.variables based on it's contents ... execution continues until doing self.year = xmlsubobject.text
1028,2017-10-05T11:32:53.000258,Kym,I'm very confused
1028,2017-10-05T11:33:03.000040,Kym,Are allowed to paste code here or should I fire a pastebin?
1028,2017-10-05T11:33:05.000135,Vada,<@Kym> use snippets to format your code
1028,2017-10-05T11:33:10.000389,Kym,The __init__ is quite long
1028,2017-10-05T11:33:12.000669,Vada,theyr'e under the +
1028,2017-10-05T11:34:28.000126,Meg,<@Kym> <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204145658-Create-a-snippet>
1028,2017-10-05T11:34:51.000345,Kym,The __init__ is in the beginning
1028,2017-10-05T11:35:50.000083,Vada,Can you tell us where it is blocking?
1028,2017-10-05T11:35:53.000461,Kym,"Execution stops at line 51, 54 or 56"
1028,2017-10-05T11:36:01.000385,Kym,"If I delete 51, it block at 54"
1028,2017-10-05T11:36:03.000168,Kym,and so on
1028,2017-10-05T11:36:06.000135,Vada,Also you can set the language in a snippet to format it/colourise etc.
1028,2017-10-05T11:36:49.000358,Vada,How big is the xml?
1028,2017-10-05T11:36:51.000710,Kym,"KK, should be better now."
1028,2017-10-05T11:37:02.000101,Kym,25000 elements
1028,2017-10-05T11:37:05.000471,Vada,in mb
1028,2017-10-05T11:37:05.000557,Kym,I had no problem before
1028,2017-10-05T11:37:29.000357,Kym,329mb
1028,2017-10-05T11:37:41.000853,Kym,I just wanted to tidy it up a bit
1028,2017-10-05T11:37:41.000855,Vada,Hmmm I'm assuming you have a few GB of ram
1028,2017-10-05T11:37:47.000300,Kym,16GB
1028,2017-10-05T11:37:51.000840,Vada,yeah
1028,2017-10-05T11:38:07.000102,Vada,"Either way do me a favour, run it but with a system monitor open and watch the RAM usage"
1028,2017-10-05T11:38:09.000439,Kym,"But, how can it be? It happen also with my test.xml"
1028,2017-10-05T11:38:14.000009,Vada,329 isn't big but it isn't small
1028,2017-10-05T11:38:19.000172,Kym,And that one is only a couple of kb.
1028,2017-10-05T11:38:23.000732,Kym,The test file is.
1028,2017-10-05T11:38:32.000347,Kym,-rw-rw-r--  1 ghost ghost  69K Oct  3 14:09 test.xml
1028,2017-10-05T11:38:45.000293,Meghan,Have you verified the xml is valid?
1028,2017-10-05T11:38:57.000172,Kym,Yup
1028,2017-10-05T11:38:59.000579,Kym,A
1028,2017-10-05T11:39:07.000376,Kym,"As I mentioned, it used to work"
1028,2017-10-05T11:39:13.000558,Kym,When I only used Jupyter
1028,2017-10-05T11:39:18.000235,Kym,Now I took the XML
1028,2017-10-05T11:39:29.000402,Kym,parsing logic out of the function itself and magically ... broken
1028,2017-10-05T11:39:34.000213,Kym,Haha :slightly_smiling_face:
1028,2017-10-05T11:39:50.000520,Kym,It also used to work with the 400mb and the 1.5gb files I have
1028,2017-10-05T11:40:44.000421,Vada,How have you verified where it stops?
1028,2017-10-05T11:40:50.000518,Kym,Logging
1028,2017-10-05T11:41:38.000803,Kym,The funny thing is:
1028,2017-10-05T11:42:02.000579,Kym,1. execution apparently never leaves instantiation of article=PubmedArticle(elem)
1028,2017-10-05T11:42:16.000324,Kym,"2. magically, the execution continues after the end of the loop"
1028,2017-10-05T11:42:20.000723,Kym,"That means,"
1028,2017-10-05T11:42:38.000311,Kym,line 251 STILL gets executed!!
1028,2017-10-05T11:43:25.000098,Meghan,What exception is being raised?
1028,2017-10-05T11:43:29.000114,Kym,NONE!
1028,2017-10-05T11:43:33.000430,Vada,Which line is that one <@Kym>
1028,2017-10-05T11:43:49.000436,Sirena,"incidentally, in that last line of the `__init__`, do you mean `self.authorslist` instead of `self.authors`?"
1028,2017-10-05T11:44:03.000373,Kym,"<@Vada>, which one do you mean?"
1028,2017-10-05T11:44:11.000290,Kym,"<@Sirena>, I'll check sec."
1028,2017-10-05T11:44:15.000373,Vada,The one you are talking about ion 1
1028,2017-10-05T11:44:28.000204,Vada,article=PubMedArticle
1028,2017-10-05T11:45:49.000099,Kym,"<@Sirena>, you're right. That point still isn't reached."
1028,2017-10-05T11:45:55.000774,Kym,"I've fixed it, though."
1028,2017-10-05T11:46:19.000481,Kym,line 188
1028,2017-10-05T11:46:33.000365,Kym,The print('HELLO') I put in the snippet is never reached.
1028,2017-10-05T11:46:40.000122,Sirena,"yah, didn't really think it was the issue, but figured I'd mention it while I was looking at it"
1028,2017-10-05T11:47:05.000494,Kym,Wait ...
1028,2017-10-05T11:47:07.000125,Meghan,Can you give us the snippet htat calls `medxml_to_sqlite`?
1028,2017-10-05T11:47:22.000463,Vada,<@Kym> the finally will always execute error or not
1028,2017-10-05T11:47:29.000207,Kym,Yup!
1028,2017-10-05T11:47:29.000693,Vada,That you don't receive one is odd
1028,2017-10-05T11:47:40.000525,Vada,as in receive an error
1028,2017-10-05T11:47:49.000605,Kym,I'll remove the try/except andsee if it shows me something
1028,2017-10-05T11:47:55.000478,Kym,I'm not passing it though
1028,2017-10-05T11:48:01.000315,Vada,Yeah that would be best - not good to except Exception
1028,2017-10-05T11:48:30.000006,Kym,"<@Meghan> medxml_to_sqlite('../data/test.xml','../data/test.sqlite')"
1028,2017-10-05T11:48:32.000188,Meghan,"Yeah, I'm thinking there is an exception, but the calling function is silently handling it when it is raised."
1028,2017-10-05T11:48:57.000360,Mallie,Yeah make sure you set your logging to DEBUG for everything if it isn't already
1028,2017-10-05T11:48:58.000207,Meghan,"The whole function that calls medxml_to_sqlite, if you can."
1028,2017-10-05T11:49:09.000258,Vada,"also on line 201, keywordslist is undefined"
1028,2017-10-05T11:49:37.000019,Vada,<@Kym> what are you using as your IDE?
1028,2017-10-05T11:49:40.000220,Vada,Jupyter?
1028,2017-10-05T11:49:41.000071,Meghan,"Or, throw in a log.exception at line 247"
1028,2017-10-05T11:49:59.000161,Kym,Jupyter yup
1028,2017-10-05T11:50:05.000684,Mallie,If the Exception were hitting there though it'd be raised - you are saying Jupyter is suppressing it?
1028,2017-10-05T11:50:10.000489,Vada,Never tried jupyter
1028,2017-10-05T11:50:21.000362,Kym,But it also behaves in the same way on pycharm
1028,2017-10-05T11:50:23.000661,Kym,Have both
1028,2017-10-05T11:50:27.000258,Meghan,"Is Jupyter calling that function itself, or is another function calling it?"
1028,2017-10-05T11:50:37.000182,Vada,But in pycharm the code analysis looks like this:
1028,2017-10-05T11:50:43.000101,Meghan,"(I've not used Jupyter, so I'm clueless on how it works.)"
1028,2017-10-05T11:50:51.000810,Vada,"orange = warning, red = error"
1028,2017-10-05T11:50:57.000392,Kym,Jum ...
1028,2017-10-05T11:51:03.000144,Vada,and a lot of the warnings are potential errors
1028,2017-10-05T11:51:05.000742,Meghan,"Yeah, that red is stuff that will break your code."
1028,2017-10-05T11:51:07.000536,Kym,Mine doesn't show anything.
1028,2017-10-05T11:51:09.000756,Vada,so might be worth double checking your code
1028,2017-10-05T11:51:19.000179,Kym,Let me see if I can configure it to show the analysis.
1028,2017-10-05T11:51:28.000308,Vada,No idea if jupyter does
1028,2017-10-05T11:51:32.000067,Vada,but I recommend pycharm :wink:
1028,2017-10-05T11:52:02.000240,Vada,and they support jupyter notebooks
1028,2017-10-05T11:52:02.000647,Vada,<https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-ipython-jupyter-notebook-with-pycharm.html>
1028,2017-10-05T11:52:13.000736,Mallie,Does Jupyter include an editor? I didn't realize that.
1028,2017-10-05T11:52:33.000009,Meghan,"I've got to go, but I really think the calling function is ignoring the raised exception, either with suppress or a blanket try/except."
1028,2017-10-05T11:52:37.000267,Kym,"Yup, is not very good but I like it to scratch stuff and then I try to refactor it in Pycharm"
1028,2017-10-05T11:52:44.000518,Kym,I think this is it:
1028,2017-10-05T11:53:11.000823,Mallie,Does it have a hook for like pyflakes or anything? Any kind of syntax checking?
1028,2017-10-05T11:54:21.000802,Vada,Even if it's not it it's still an issue
1028,2017-10-05T11:54:31.000562,Kym,So I'll test two things:
1028,2017-10-05T11:54:39.000454,Kym,exception being swallowed somehow
1028,2017-10-05T11:54:53.000573,Kym,perhaps those lines trigger the exception
1028,2017-10-05T11:55:15.000601,Kym,"that's why when I remove set year, day, month execution continues until next assignment"
1028,2017-10-05T11:55:36.000131,Mallie,"IIRC you don't re-set `datetime` atttributes, you use replace: <https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.replace>"
1028,2017-10-05T11:55:56.000532,Mallie,So it seems like it is catching your Exceptions and logging them
1028,2017-10-05T11:58:16.000091,Mallie,"```

1028,2017-10-05T12:01:34.000834,Seema,<@Marcie> Did you ever figure it out?
1028,2017-10-05T12:03:29.000810,Kym,I'm on it! :slightly_smiling_face:
1028,2017-10-05T12:03:57.000044,Kym,I can't bring the damn thing to generate <@Mallie>'s exception.
1028,2017-10-05T12:04:25.000809,Kym,But I think that's it problem with setting the date+exception getting lost somehow
1028,2017-10-05T12:06:52.000415,Mallie,<@Kym> What is the output of `import sys; sys.excepthook`?
1028,2017-10-05T12:08:53.000655,Mallie,"In the interpreter where this is happening of course, so however you make that happen in a Jupyter notebook."
1028,2017-10-05T12:26:45.000431,Kym,"OK:
1. the exception <@Mallie> pointed out was indeed one of the problems. The fact that I tried to set pubdate.year and month triggered the exception ""AttributeError: attribute 'month' of 'datetime.date' objects is not writable"" 
2. Now, the interesting part is why the exception was being ""swallowed."" It was because I put the return clause in the finally block!

    finally:
        curs.connection.commit()
        curs.connection.close()
        return len(root.getchildren())

vs.

    finally:
        curs.connection.commit()
        curs.connection.close()
    return len(root.getchildren())"
1028,2017-10-05T12:27:28.000061,Kym,Does it make sense that the exception is hidden just because I put the return clause in the finally block? ... I broke Python? heh
1028,2017-10-05T12:28:36.000009,Mallie,"&gt;If finally is present, it specifies a ‘cleanup’ handler. The try clause is executed, including any except and else clauses. If an exception occurs in any of the clauses and is not handled, the exception is temporarily saved. The finally clause is executed. If there is a saved exception, it is re-raised at the end of the finally clause. If the finally clause raises another exception or executes a return or break statement, the saved exception is discarded"
1028,2017-10-05T12:28:39.000354,Mallie,Nice one!

1028,2017-10-05T12:30:10.000224,Ciera,interesting find
1028,2017-10-05T12:31:44.000222,Kym,Now the interesting part ... print(sys.version): 3.5.3
1028,2017-10-05T12:31:56.000242,Sirena,seems like return inside of finally should be discouraged pretty broadly
1028,2017-10-05T12:32:09.000118,Kym,"Yes, but the docu doesn't say anything."

When an exception has occurred in the try clause and has not been handled by an except clause (or it has occurred in an except or else clause), it is re-raised after the finally clause has been executed. The finally clause is also executed “on the way out” when any other clause of the try statement is left via a break, continue or return statement. A more complicated example:"""
1028,2017-10-05T12:33:48.000377,Mallie,"I linked to the reference docs, that's where the quote comes from"

1028,2017-10-05T12:34:12.000429,Kym,IN the 3docs it says nothing about discarding exceptions

1028,2017-10-05T12:34:33.000692,Mallie,But maybe it's not as clear lol
1028,2017-10-05T12:35:34.000077,Ciera,I mean it's pretty logical it's going to discard one if a second exception is raised in the finally
1028,2017-10-05T12:35:42.000299,Ciera,I don't really see how they could have done different
1028,2017-10-05T12:38:05.000764,Sirena,the 3 docs have it in there also

1. A finally clause is always executed **before** leaving the try statement,
- so execution looks like so: try&gt;finally&gt;except
2. whether an exception has occurred or not
- in this case an exception occurred in the try block
3. When an exception has occurred in the try clause and has not been handled by an except clause
- in this case the exception wasn't handled by the except clause because there was a finally
4. it is re-raised after the finally clause has been executed
- but the finally clause returns, so we leave context and never come back to execute the except block"
1028,2017-10-05T12:41:47.000702,Kym,Jum ... what's the preferred way to suggest changes to the docu?
1028,2017-10-05T12:41:55.000248,Kym,Pull request?
1028,2017-10-05T12:42:19.000198,Mallie,"Well tutorial is kinda more ""things you should do or most people do do"", the reference should be complete"

1028,2017-10-05T12:43:35.000189,Kym,That's true
1028,2017-10-05T12:46:24.000275,Kym,"Thanks for helping everyone, I wasn't expecting this bug to be so ... ""insightful?"" :slightly_smiling_face:"
1028,2017-10-05T12:48:03.000034,Sirena,it's still try &gt; except &gt; finally
1028,2017-10-05T12:49:10.000406,Sirena,"but if you have
```except Exception as e:
  raise (e)
finally:
  return 'something'```"
1028,2017-10-05T12:49:28.000436,Sirena,"the `raise (e)` doesn't do anything, because the finally runs after it, discarding the exception"
1028,2017-10-05T12:49:46.000245,Mallie,"<@Kym> Yeah, nice interview question! lol"
1028,2017-10-05T12:50:35.000055,Sirena,"or at least, that's the way it looks to me"
1028,2017-10-05T12:53:00.000199,Sirena,"really the more I think about this, the more I think it should be a warning to put return inside finally, but maybe there's a corner case where it's appropriate"
1028,2017-10-05T12:54:17.000261,Kym,"I agree, <@Sirena>"
1028,2017-10-05T12:54:48.000569,Kym,Regarding the second one I'd still say it's try&gt;except&gt;finally
1028,2017-10-05T12:55:04.000003,Kym,"It says, finally is always executed after try"
1028,2017-10-05T12:55:10.000719,Kym,Otherwise it wouldn't work
1028,2017-10-05T12:55:26.000297,Kym,"I mean, the purpose of finally is to be executed before execution is terminated"
1028,2017-10-05T12:55:34.000593,Kym,and this happens after the raise
1028,2017-10-05T12:55:37.000078,Kym,no?
1028,2017-10-05T12:56:44.000644,Kym,Hm ...
1028,2017-10-05T12:57:02.000404,Kym,What if we do a raise instead of print('two')
1028,2017-10-05T12:57:04.000018,Kym,?
1028,2017-10-05T12:57:34.000453,Kym,Does print('three') happen before th
1028,2017-10-05T12:57:49.000077,Kym,"the raise or after? I think it makes a difference, let me try."
1028,2017-10-05T13:02:17.000658,Kym,line 7 is never executed
1028,2017-10-05T13:02:29.000244,Kym,even without the return
1028,2017-10-05T13:03:01.000732,Kym,which makes sense ... because that's what raise is for
1028,2017-10-05T13:05:58.000291,Kym,"Hm ... the sequence is indeed:
try &gt; except &gt; finally
The only problem was that although raise triggered an exception and the exception was saved, return led to it being discarded."
1029,2017-10-05T12:54:30.000308,Kym,Regarding your second statement
1029,2017-10-05T12:55:54.000379,Suellen,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; try:
...  print('one')
...  1/0

one
two
three

1030,2017-10-05T14:10:48.000382,Seema,"I'm looking to level up.  I was debating between [Git, debugging/IDE, concept deep dive in Python like decorators/metaclasses, something else].  I'm out of n00bie and into rookie territory.  Any suggestions?"
1030,2017-10-05T14:12:59.000548,Mallie,When you say git <@Seema> do you mean you don't have experience with version control or you want to dig into git guts?
1030,2017-10-05T14:13:36.000119,Seema,inexperienced with version control
1030,2017-10-05T14:14:02.000322,Mallie,"Do that - pick some sort of task you want to accomplish and use git to do it and track changes, etc. and so on"
1030,2017-10-05T14:14:25.000307,Mallie,"In terms of ""things"" developers do, after you understand basic logic, that is the most necessary and pragmatic thing"
1030,2017-10-05T14:14:39.000381,Sirena,"yeah, and it might be a false choice, you'll probably learn a bit of everything as you go along"
1030,2017-10-05T14:14:42.000304,Mallie,"In terms of ""doing"" code, it is absolutely essential to not just having a rat's nest history"
1030,2017-10-05T14:15:33.000418,Seema,"OK, thanks.  I've been using PyCharm.  Would you suggest using version control through there or go full command line crazy for the learning part?"
1030,2017-10-05T14:15:56.000381,Mallie,"Dunno PyCharm so get another opinion. I do it on the command line personally (and gitlab, github, etc.)"
1030,2017-10-05T14:16:05.000350,Mallie,But I am mostly comfortable on the command line
1030,2017-10-05T14:16:50.000111,Sirena,"try both I would say. command line git isn't what I would call user friendly, but it does give you the most power and flexibility"
1030,2017-10-05T14:16:53.000202,Mallie,"What matters is concepts, for the most part, so it depends how/where you want to work IMO"
1030,2017-10-05T14:17:06.000270,Mallie,"If PyCharm abstracts a lot of what git works is _meant_ to do, I'd be kinda meh about that..."
1030,2017-10-05T14:17:17.000075,Mallie,"But I really doubt that, it's probably just a nice wrapper"
1030,2017-10-05T14:17:53.000328,Mallie,I changed that - I mean to imply _why_ VC and not _how_ VC

1030,2017-10-05T14:19:11.000417,Mallie,"Also if you ever care to contribute to OSS <@Seema> it's obviously essential, plus, as you read diffs and patches and make sense of commits, etc. you'll get better at interpreting/reading code, which is something I know you are working on"
1030,2017-10-05T14:19:20.000636,Sirena,"I use PyCharm, but for a variety of team-related reasons I use the command line for git interactions"
1030,2017-10-05T14:20:16.000096,Seema,"Alrighty, after all the laundry I've been avoiding and the grocey shopping, I'll dig into git and pycharm and CLIgit and check it out from there."

1030,2017-10-05T14:23:09.000035,Seema,I've already concluded that I PyCharm + git is not the way I'm going.
1030,2017-10-05T14:23:10.000561,Patty,now get off my lawn
1030,2017-10-05T14:23:52.000400,Sirena,"<@Seema> would you say it's more PyCharm you're not going to use, or more git?"
1030,2017-10-05T14:25:24.000305,Seema,The act of learning the concepts of git and the workflow and then adding a layer of PyCharm learning how to do the things seems to muddy the waters from the first 5 minutes of video watching and post reading.  I don't know in the future but for the learning CLI only now.
1030,2017-10-05T14:25:30.000145,Mallie,<@Patty> <https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290#comments>
1030,2017-10-05T14:26:25.000327,Seema,"committed by Linus Torvalds Apr7, 2005"
1030,2017-10-05T14:26:43.000352,Patty,best README ever
1030,2017-10-05T14:27:21.000555,Patty,Also <@Seema> the workflow and concepts of git are going to be the same whether they are CLI or in PyCharm
1030,2017-10-05T14:29:02.000284,Seema,"<@Patty> I get that but the layer of abstraction is a button or interface I would be ""learning"" and I can come back to the later (or not).  The tutorials all have that click here, click there on how to use git in PyCharm."
1030,2017-10-05T14:30:46.000460,Patty,"It’s just clicks vs. commands. A lot of the naming overlaps as well. In my experience most people get frustrated and move to CLI, which is used more, and has a lot more resources online"
1030,2017-10-05T14:31:24.000732,Seema,"so...you're suggesting that learning git through PyCharm will not be ""noisy""?"
1030,2017-10-05T14:33:30.000654,Patty,some things are harder to do than with CLI. personally what i’ve seen from my students was ditching something in a program for CLI so that they are interacting with git a bit more “closely” and it lends to better understanding/learning. It also makes things difficult if you are on a machine without PyCharm
1030,2017-10-05T14:33:55.000440,Patty,I’ve found that CLI + a GUI tool like SourceTree (if you are a visual person and like to see state of a repo that way) works best
1030,2017-10-05T14:35:02.000158,Sirena,"yeah, a GUI tool of some kind is important"
1030,2017-10-05T14:35:44.000132,Patty,depends on the learner and the goals. some people go into SourceTree and then lean on it for a longgg time
1030,2017-10-05T14:35:58.000034,Sirena,I think git ships with a tool called `gitk` which will provide a minimal GUI
1030,2017-10-05T14:36:34.000418,Sirena,at least in most common packages for git
1030,2017-10-05T14:36:59.000154,Patty,different packages
1030,2017-10-05T14:37:31.000139,Mallie,"I don't use a GUI for git day-to-day, and the only ones I ever have were github/gitlab, but everyone is different"
1030,2017-10-05T14:37:40.000476,Kym,"<@Seema>, I wrote a Git tutorial for me and my friends a while ago. I found most of the documentation online to shallow or to deep. Perhaps it resonates with you:
<https://sentheon.com/blog/easy-git-guide-and-reference-for-the-busy.html>"

1030,2017-10-05T14:38:35.000657,Seema,"off to lunch, laundry, learn, thanks for resource"
1031,2017-10-05T15:08:31.000021,Dominick,"So I'm falling victim to copying code from SO without understanding how it works. I have this ranking function:

```
def get_ranks(item, dictionary, reverse):
    dictionary_sorted = sorted(dictionary.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=reverse)
    rank, count, previous, result = 0, 0, None, {}
    for key, num in dictionary_sorted:
        count += 1
        if num != previous:
            rank += count
            previous = num
            count = 0
        result[key] = rank
    return result[item]
```

I have 1,013 key, value pairs in my dictionary. 698 of them have a value of 100 so they should all be ranked #1, then the next non-100 value should be ranked 699. Instead, they're all ranked 698th. Any idea how to get the starting rank at #1 when they're all the same?"
1031,2017-10-05T15:16:39.000602,Sirena,"I'm confused, are you re-sorting the dictionary every time you ask for one of its entries?"
1031,2017-10-05T15:17:16.000390,Sirena,"if you pick 3 entries from your dictionary, what output are you expecting, and what are you getting?"
1031,2017-10-05T15:19:31.000057,Dominick,"Ya - I am re-sorting the dict every time I ask for a rank, which is dumb so i should definitely re-do that.

For example, I have 3 keys, all with scores of 100: `{'key1': 100, 'key2': 100, 'key3': 100, 'key4': 50}`. It's currently returning ranks like 'key1'=3, 'key2'=3, 'key3'=3, 'key4'=4, but I want it as 'key1'=1, 'key2'=1, 'key3'=1, 'key4'=4"
1031,2017-10-05T15:22:14.000716,Sirena,"when I run that, I get 1,1,1,4"
1031,2017-10-05T15:22:52.000272,Antionette,<@Sirena> I'm very glad you said that cause I read through the code like 3 times and thought it looked like it was working as wanted
1031,2017-10-05T15:23:20.000345,Antionette,because the rank only updates after a change in value
1031,2017-10-05T15:23:48.000166,Dominick,"It's strange - it actually works for most of my dicts, but on a couple it gives the behavior I described."
1031,2017-10-05T15:24:23.000198,Antionette,for the ones where it doesn't work are the values classes instead of a simple data type?
1031,2017-10-05T15:25:19.000435,Dominick,Nope...it's a django aggregation (`Avg`).
1031,2017-10-05T15:26:06.000289,Dominick,Of a `FloatField`
1031,2017-10-05T15:38:10.000406,Dominick,When I dumped that same dict to a json and ran the `get_rank` function outside of Django it returned all the 100's as ranking 113...
1031,2017-10-05T15:38:18.000298,Dominick,"Ya it's just really long, but I'll post the dict in a snippet."
1031,2017-10-05T15:39:13.000059,Dominick,All those values of 999999 are just there to be ranked last automatically.
1031,2017-10-05T16:01:22.000378,Dominick,3.5.2
1031,2017-10-05T16:01:26.000353,Dominick,Did you get those same weird results?
1031,2017-10-05T16:08:05.000536,Dominick,"well...say there are fifty scores of 100. I want it to rank all those 50 as rank #1, then rank the next highest score of 99.0 (or whatever) as rank #51. Right now it's ranking all those fifty scores of 100 as rank #50, then the next highest score is ranked #51."

1031,2017-10-05T16:37:05.000572,Ciera,I'm almost certain it doesn't
1032,2017-10-05T15:37:52.000441,Antionette,can you print an exact example of one of the dicts that doesn't work?
1032,2017-10-05T15:54:35.000466,Antionette,"this is tricky, nothing stands out to me as why that would be. python version?"
1032,2017-10-05T16:04:51.000116,Antionette,"maybe, but it looks like there are values less than 100 (`""13801"": 96.0`) so I'm not sure what the expected behavior is"
1032,2017-10-05T16:08:36.000076,Antionette,I'm assuming if 100 is the first number though right?
1032,2017-10-05T16:08:46.000277,Antionette,do you know what 100 should be in your example
1032,2017-10-05T16:09:23.000006,Dominick,ohhhhhh wait I think I know what's happening
1032,2017-10-05T16:09:57.000171,Dominick,its ranking 999999 higher than 100 (obviously). Later on I change those 999999 to 'N/A' values in the table.
1032,2017-10-05T16:10:21.000258,Dominick,that's definitely the issue - thanks for getting me to the solution haha :slightly_smiling_face:
1032,2017-10-05T16:10:53.000427,Antionette,lol pn
1032,2017-10-05T16:10:54.000436,Antionette,np
1032,2017-10-05T16:11:19.000193,Antionette,ah you were not reversing
1032,2017-10-05T16:11:37.000286,Antionette,I thought you were going in ascending ordering
1032,2017-10-05T16:11:52.000156,Antionette,because of the 99999s lol
1032,2017-10-05T16:11:56.000141,Antionette,so that makes sense
1032,2017-10-05T16:12:02.000091,Antionette,glad you got it
1032,2017-10-05T16:14:04.000567,Dominick,haha ya - that took an embarrassingly long time to realize my mistake

1036,2017-10-06T02:41:37.000193,Ciera,possible it's in your browser cache or something ?
1036,2017-10-06T02:42:56.000145,Kayce,"Woahhhh I just notice something weird, Is there a difference between 127.0.0.1 and localhost?"
1036,2017-10-06T02:47:38.000179,Kayce,"<@Ciera> I was thinking that could be the case.

localhost:5000 seems to be serving cached files. The flask server only logs a couple requests but chrome sees many, whereas if I point my browser to 127.0.0.1:5000 then the flask logs show that all files are being uploaded and I am now able to see my missing bundle.js (as expected)."
1036,2017-10-06T02:48:38.000026,Ciera,:thumbsup:
1036,2017-10-06T02:49:32.000008,Kayce,I still fail to see why `localhost:5000 != 127.0.0.1:5000`
1036,2017-10-06T02:50:27.000148,Ciera,it's the same but chrome cache might handle it like two different address
1036,2017-10-06T02:50:46.000164,Ciera,so a cache for localhost and a different one for 127.0.0.1
1036,2017-10-06T02:51:48.000119,Kayce,devtools cache should be disabled =/
1036,2017-10-06T02:52:07.000161,Kayce,... and thats false!
1036,2017-10-06T02:52:19.000148,Kayce,apparently i was caching :facepalm:

1036,2017-10-06T03:02:24.000271,Kayce,"Actually, I revoke this question until I noodle around a bit. I'll come back to it later if it persists."
1036,2017-10-06T07:08:03.000022,Meg,"<@Kayce> in addition, localhost allows you to have some security exceptions, like when using the browser geolocation api and iframes… at least with chrome.  Not sure if they still apply to `127.0.0.1` or in other browsers.  That’ll let you do some dev work with those two, without requiring SSL in the former and dealing with lots of special cases with the latter"

1037,2017-10-06T08:37:45.000441,Ciera,I believe the stdlib csvreader use a generator so you can use that and process it line by line
1037,2017-10-06T08:38:25.000360,Ciera,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17444679/reading-a-huge-csv-file>
1037,2017-10-06T08:47:14.000145,Meg,<@Aimee> any chance you can import to a database and use python to retrieve the data from there?
1037,2017-10-06T08:47:48.000176,Meg,"that would allow you to use the db for faster queries, analysis and such, without having to re-read and import the data upon each program execution"
1037,2017-10-06T08:49:21.000062,Aimee,<@Ciera> thanks for your message. i actually read the exact same article not too long ago. it looks like using a generator is the only smart idea. but i am not sure when talking about 2m rows
1037,2017-10-06T08:50:04.000158,Aimee,"<@Meg> thanks for you message. unfortunately, i cant. i am receiving this as an export myself. now i have to deal with it that way :slightly_smiling_face:"
1037,2017-10-06T08:51:12.000348,Ciera,db is definitively a better idea. If you use correctly generator is the number of rows shouldn't matter
1037,2017-10-06T08:51:16.000127,Ciera,but it can be slow
1037,2017-10-06T08:51:34.000371,Meg,"Oof, OK. Then I'd try out <@Ciera>'s suggestion"
1037,2017-10-06T08:52:32.000345,Ciera,well you can still insert it in a db the first time and afterwards use the db
1037,2017-10-06T08:54:19.000088,Aimee,<@Ciera> i have to admit i do not have that much experience working with generators - especially at that scale.
1037,2017-10-06T08:55:07.000350,Aimee,<@Ciera> <@Meg> i normally tend to use google drive and read files through the google api but this file is too large for google drive
1037,2017-10-06T08:55:22.000074,Patty,"basically, a generator will only pop off one row at a time, which is called `yield`ing"
1037,2017-10-06T08:55:35.000218,Patty,that way it doesn’t have to hold the whole CSV in memory
1037,2017-10-06T08:55:37.000171,Ciera,if you follow the SO post it should be :thumbsup:
1037,2017-10-06T08:56:57.000077,Aimee,"<@Patty> thank you. yes, i totally understand the concept of generator functions. just havent written and worked with many of them myself"
1037,2017-10-06T08:58:43.000192,Carri,if all you want is the unique values in column 6 then `cut | sort | uniq` would generally be the quickest way
1037,2017-10-06T09:03:58.000101,Meg,"sounds like a good learning experience for you.  but don’t forget, instanciating that many objects will have an impact on your memory.  In addition, any kind of analysis done will be dependent on how python runs on your system"
1037,2017-10-06T09:04:19.000228,Meg,are you using pandas?
1037,2017-10-06T10:18:18.000586,Aimee,"<@Meg> yes, i am using pandas. but not in that context yet."
1037,2017-10-06T10:19:42.000478,Meg,"ok, because that would save time"
1037,2017-10-06T10:19:57.000479,Meg,it has a pretty bulletproof csv import functionality
1037,2017-10-06T10:20:14.000515,Meg,"so if you’re doing searching, analysis, etc, I’d look into that rather than rolling your own code"
1038,2017-10-06T10:35:45.000142,Sirena,So I'm on a sortof low-urgency search for a dev-friendly widget kit in python that is available for linux. My preference is for a.) minimal installation headaches and dependencies and b.) availability on RHEL6/CentOS6. Anyone have a suggestion or care to weigh in on the pros and cons? I'm currently using PyQt4 (which I think is a dependency headache) on one project and pygtk on another

1040,2017-10-06T12:09:41.000001,Seema,"<@Kym> Wonderful Git Guide, thank you"
1041,2017-10-06T12:32:44.000433,Winnie,can you pass a class into a subclass and have it keep all previous properties?
1041,2017-10-06T12:34:43.000048,Meg,"sure, define class properties in `__init__`"
1041,2017-10-06T12:35:02.000367,Meg,"unless the subclass overwrites them, you’ll have the superclass properties the same"
1041,2017-10-06T12:35:19.000115,Winnie,like
1041,2017-10-06T12:35:35.000423,Winnie,I have a function that generates a superclass
1041,2017-10-06T12:36:15.000291,Winnie,is it possible to pass that superclass into the subclass instead or repeating the function and adding more elements?
1041,2017-10-06T12:37:04.000030,Meg,"uhh, generates a superclass?"
1041,2017-10-06T12:37:26.000266,Meg,I think you’re mixing up OOP basics.
1041,2017-10-06T12:37:47.000066,Meg,"in your init of the subclass, have it take in properties you want set."
1041,2017-10-06T12:38:05.000529,Meg,superclass should have fields already set via its own init
1041,2017-10-06T12:38:53.000500,Winnie,"```
class A(object):
    ...
class B(A):
    ...
def make_A(data) -&gt; A:
    ....
def make_B(data):
    B(make_A(data), data[-1])
```"
1041,2017-10-06T12:39:18.000096,Meg,"in B, define an `__init__`"
1041,2017-10-06T12:39:34.000194,Meg,"that will call `super(A, self).__init__()` with the required properties"
1041,2017-10-06T12:40:20.000099,Winnie,I'm a bit confused
1041,2017-10-06T12:40:29.000299,Winnie,what does passing A into super do?
1041,2017-10-06T12:40:47.000620,Winnie,because the code I'm working on passes B into super (in the B class)
1041,2017-10-06T12:41:55.000287,Meg,"```class A(object):
    def __init__(self, a, b, c):
         self.a = a
         self.b = b
         self.c = c

class B(A):
    def __init__(self, a, b, c, d):
        super().__init(a, b, c)
        self.d = d
```"
1041,2017-10-06T12:42:08.000137,Meg,that’s for python3
1041,2017-10-06T12:43:20.000538,Winnie,"```
class B(A):
    def __init__(self, a, b, c, d):
        super(B, self).__init(a, b, c)
        self.d = d
```
that's the code I'm working with"
1041,2017-10-06T12:43:44.000237,Meg,"ok, so B is a subclass of A"
1041,2017-10-06T12:43:58.000212,Meg,and you’re already instanciating properties that B inherits from A
1041,2017-10-06T12:44:37.000254,Meg,"in addition, if you have a method defined in A that’s not replicated in B, its still accessible from B"
1041,2017-10-06T12:45:37.000182,Meg,"eg, 

```class A(object):
    def some_func(self, t):  # do something

inst = B(...args)
inst.some_func('some_value')```

is perfectly valid"
1041,2017-10-06T12:45:52.000555,Meg,"so, unless I’m missing something here, you already have everything you need"
1041,2017-10-06T12:46:31.000110,Winnie,right
1041,2017-10-06T12:46:38.000087,Winnie,I understand the OOP
1041,2017-10-06T12:46:49.000189,Winnie,but I'm trying to figure out the correct syntax
1041,2017-10-06T12:47:28.000074,Winnie,"```
class A(object):
    ...
class B(A):
    ...
def make_A(data) -&gt; A:
    return A(data[0], int(data[1]))
def make_B(data):
    # is this possible?
    B(make_A(data), data[-1])
```"
1041,2017-10-06T12:47:47.000026,Sirena,what is make_A?
1041,2017-10-06T12:48:07.000573,Meg,just do `B(data)`
1041,2017-10-06T12:48:19.000656,Sirena,"if you just want an A object, `make_A(data)` should instead just be `A(data)`"
1041,2017-10-06T12:48:47.000573,Winnie,make_A parses a json and takes out the appropriate fields to put in the args
1041,2017-10-06T12:49:13.000155,Sirena,"if you want a B object that inherits A, just do B(data) and in your B.__init__(), include whatever funky manipulations you want to the vars inherited from A"
1041,2017-10-06T12:50:44.000199,Sirena,"yah, so you probably want
```class B(A):
  def __init__(self, json):
    parse_my_json_and_do_things(self, json)```"
1041,2017-10-06T12:52:11.000037,Sirena,"there is a design pattern called a 'factory pattern' where functions return instances of objects, but I don't get the sense that is what you want in this case (I could be wrong)"
1041,2017-10-06T12:52:48.000213,Winnie,"It's what I want, I think.
But I also think its what I can't have :stuck_out_tongue:"
1041,2017-10-06T12:53:08.000223,Winnie,because this repo's factories are outside the classes
1041,2017-10-06T12:55:28.000476,Sirena,do you normally construct your objects from something other than json?
1041,2017-10-06T12:57:07.000241,Winnie,"so I guess what I was asking is, can you pass the initliasations of a class to a subclass and have it inherit them
maybe something like
```
B(**make_a(data).variables, data[-1])
```"
1041,2017-10-06T12:57:13.000559,Sirena,"factories are something loosely along the lines of
```class A:
  def __init__(self, initdata):

class B:
  def __init__(self, initdata):

def factory(type, data):
  if(type == 'A'):
    return A(data)
  elif(type == 'B'):
    return B(data)```"
1041,2017-10-06T12:57:49.000394,Winnie,I think this repo does both

1041,2017-10-06T13:00:16.000267,Winnie,"I'm adding a ""graphql_to_room"" function, where it's a copy of the above but instead with extra fields
and idk, it just felt wrong"
1041,2017-10-06T13:04:54.000006,Sirena,"it looks more like it's accepting a GraphQL object and returning a Group object, but the GraphQL object is mostly just a blob of query data, so it could contain all sorts of things"
1041,2017-10-06T13:05:39.000341,Sirena,"so this is very similar to a factory, but it uses a bunch of functions rather than a class to determine which object to return"
1041,2017-10-06T13:06:16.000200,Sirena,"if you have a graphql blob of 'room' data, then adding a graphql_to_room function would make sense, just mimic what's in most of these other functions"
1041,2017-10-06T13:06:26.000393,Winnie,yeah
1041,2017-10-06T13:06:56.000210,Winnie,"but instead of reapating code, could I get the graphql group function to do some of the work for me?"
1041,2017-10-06T13:07:50.000595,Sirena,it would depend on what's in your room data
1041,2017-10-06T13:08:12.000450,Sirena,down at the bottom of your file it defines a bunch of graphql types
1041,2017-10-06T13:08:25.000255,Sirena,"there isn't one for a room, but if you add it, then you can query a room"
1041,2017-10-06T13:08:38.000631,Sirena,"if it is meaningfully related to a group, then you might get the group function to do some work for you"
1041,2017-10-06T13:09:06.000553,Winnie,"well, a room is just a group with some extra things, so it inherits from it"
1041,2017-10-06T13:09:18.000020,Sirena,"but assuming a room is not a group with additions, and a group is not a room with additions, it's probably most sensible to write a separate independent function"
1041,2017-10-06T13:09:22.000208,Sirena,ah
1041,2017-10-06T13:09:24.000381,Sirena,then yah
1041,2017-10-06T13:09:53.000354,Winnie,"The problem is, I don't know *how* to get it to do some work for me :stuck_out_tongue:"
1041,2017-10-06T13:11:06.000516,Sirena,what does your `class Room:` look like?
1041,2017-10-06T13:11:34.000592,Patty,not to be confused with `classroom`
1041,2017-10-06T13:19:53.000353,Sirena,and then what does your graphql room query look like?
1041,2017-10-06T13:22:08.000212,Sirena,"I think it's likely that you'll not be able to reuse graphql_to_group because it's returning a Group object from a group query, and you're going to have to write a new query for a room object"
1041,2017-10-06T13:22:27.000330,Winnie,<https://github.com/ekohilas/fbchat/blob/rooms/fbchat/graphql.py#L121>
1041,2017-10-06T13:22:43.000369,Sirena,"and I don't know the ins and outs of how that all works, but it seems like the graphql queries don't exactly have inheritance"
1041,2017-10-06T13:23:44.000577,Winnie,my idea is that I call the data on the graphql_room and then just unpack it's data into Room()?
1041,2017-10-06T13:25:25.000025,Sirena,"yeah, I see why you might want to have some code reuse, and I suppose it's a little bit of a style question, but I think it will end up less readable"
1041,2017-10-06T13:26:16.000321,Meg,"at times, it can be a tough balancing act between competing priorities"
1041,2017-10-06T13:31:58.000346,Sirena,"you might get by with something like
```def graphql_to_room_or_group(rog):
    if rog.get('image') is None:
        rog['image'] = {}
    c_info = get_customization_info(rog)
    if(rog.get('thread_admins')):

    else:  # not a room
      return Group(many args)```"
1041,2017-10-06T13:32:17.000679,Sirena,but it's still going to be a lot of similar code duplicated
1041,2017-10-06T13:33:48.000177,Sirena,"alternately, you could modify your Room.__init() to include a Group argument"
1041,2017-10-06T13:35:19.000378,Winnie,isn't there a way to get the fields from a group and just put them into a room as **kwargs

A couple of things here
The .sort method is in place, and returns none
Python functions work by reference, so when you pass a list Into a function, anything you do to the list will become a side effect
You could use the min function instead
Or, you could call `list(sorted(l))` and work on that instead (which is a not-in-place sort "

1055,2017-10-07T10:28:20.000003,Mirian,it should be easy using one of the github api wrappers for Python
1055,2017-10-07T10:28:48.000021,Mirian,e.g. there is PyGithub package
1055,2017-10-07T10:30:01.000072,Mirian,it has method for retrieving all repo related infos <http://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github.html#github.MainClass.Github.get_repo>
1055,2017-10-07T10:30:10.000124,Mirian,I'd start this way
1055,2017-10-07T10:30:44.000023,Honey,thanks <@Mirian>!
1055,2017-10-07T10:31:08.000006,Honey,how do I add PyGitHub package in my project? is it just the same way as importing Flask?
1055,2017-10-07T10:31:53.000011,Mirian,"yes, but you have to install it first (like Flask), so `pip install PyGithub` should work"
1055,2017-10-07T10:32:41.000063,Honey,Is it not easier to just create my own function? Why do I need to use a library like this?
1055,2017-10-07T10:34:10.000111,Mirian,"ok, you have two solutions:
- use official github API
- scrape html to retrieve the information you need"
1055,2017-10-07T10:34:24.000087,Mirian,I think the first one is easier
1055,2017-10-07T10:34:55.000024,Mirian,so you could just make direct http request or just use python wrapper that I mentioned
1055,2017-10-07T10:36:01.000089,Honey,"i like the wrapper I think but it seems like its asking for github username and password ```from github import Github

g = Github(""user"", ""password"")```"
1055,2017-10-07T10:36:12.000077,Mirian,so definitely you don't need to install anything if you're comfortable with making direct http requests etc.
1055,2017-10-07T10:36:53.000083,Honey,Is that necessary? I dont want to commit my  github username and password in public repo
1055,2017-10-07T10:37:42.000060,Mirian,you could use API token I guess (but it should stay secret too)
1055,2017-10-07T10:38:04.000006,Mirian,the solution to that is reading from file or environment variables
1055,2017-10-07T10:38:37.000066,Mirian,you could have some json (or other extension) that it's not committed to the repository
1055,2017-10-07T10:39:20.000036,Mirian,"so if anyone wants to use your app, he should provide the config with his own credentials"
1055,2017-10-07T10:39:21.000101,Honey,"Okay I think I got you, I can passing environment vars. does this library let me download data from other repositories and not just my own repository?"
1055,2017-10-07T10:40:07.000056,Mirian,"I would be surprised if it wouldn't, but of course those repositories must be public"

1071,2017-10-09T15:20:47.000237,Frieda,you'd have to cast that to multiple dicts
1071,2017-10-09T15:20:55.000448,Frieda,or make the value a list of values
1071,2017-10-09T15:21:53.000490,Johnette,Essentially looping through the list and making your own dictionary object?
1071,2017-10-09T15:23:25.000225,Frieda,I'd probably just use `collections.defaultdict`

1071,2017-10-09T16:30:41.000046,Mohammed,like look for import errors for example
1071,2017-10-09T16:30:54.000132,Mohammed,My challenge is as follows
1071,2017-10-09T16:31:41.000496,Mohammed,"I have a package that relies on many very different 3rd party modules, in essence - we are building API wrappers, then implementing actions e.g. do something with the API wrapper"
1071,2017-10-09T16:31:47.000031,Mohammed,"some are py2, some are py3"
1071,2017-10-09T16:31:59.000601,Mohammed,some of these packages don’t work in 2 and 3
1071,2017-10-09T16:32:19.000159,Mohammed,"so our module, which has all these classes which are wrappers around APIs"
1071,2017-10-09T16:32:25.000223,Mohammed,get’s picky depending on py2 or 3
1071,2017-10-09T16:32:38.000296,Mohammed,so we inadvertently break our import statements
1071,2017-10-09T16:32:45.000232,Mohammed,always at the worst time
1071,2017-10-09T16:33:13.000195,Mohammed,so - I guess I’m asking how to catch this earlier with testing
1071,2017-10-09T16:34:33.000299,Mohammed,"I’m fully aware there is probably a better solution to my py2-py3 challenges, and we’ve talk about having a separate package/repo for py2 and py3 code, but I’d prefer not it if possible, but since we aren’t just a small module, we are a framework of integrations, it creates these import challenges that I’m admittedly not an expert on"
1071,2017-10-09T16:35:46.000255,Mohammed,<@Frieda> did help or make my question more ambigious
1071,2017-10-09T16:37:13.000119,Frieda,hmm. you couldn't just figure out which one break on which version and nest their imports under a check against `sys.version_info`?
1071,2017-10-09T16:37:14.000621,Johnette,"<@Frieda> when I dict convert it what happened was I got a dict with the structure of `{""Keys"":[], ""Value"":[]}`"
1071,2017-10-09T16:37:42.000304,Mohammed,I’ll add that my module of class wrappers has an __init__.py that has try | except blocks
1071,2017-10-09T16:38:19.000274,Frieda,non-cross-platform-compatible imports co-existing in a single code base is *_HARD_*
1071,2017-10-09T16:38:32.000484,Johnette,That was bad english.... I had to convert it to a dict from a defaultdict because thats the dictionary I got back ^

1071,2017-10-09T16:40:32.000505,Mohammed,<@Frieda> yea - that might be a good suggestion
1071,2017-10-09T16:41:00.000007,Frieda,"<@Mohammed> you could set up tox to test your codebase w/ both py2 and py3, record the failures and start moving them into try/except or if blocks"
1071,2017-10-09T16:41:05.000063,Johnette,"Yeah it works... just not beautiful, but oh well"

1074,2017-10-10T05:51:34.000171,Chi,morning! in my class we were instructed to install python3 from terminal in order to run matplotlib and now I’m getting errors when I try to read files (UnicodeDecodeError: ‘ascii’ codec can’t decode byte 0xe2 in position 121: ordinal not in range(128))” I’m assuming it has something to do with utf-8. has anyone else had this issue?
1074,2017-10-10T05:55:05.000107,Chi,"open(file_name, ‘r’)"
1074,2017-10-10T05:55:50.000272,Collette,"` with open(file_name, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:`"
1074,2017-10-10T05:56:07.000265,Collette,"If you know that the encoding is UTF-8, of course."
1074,2017-10-10T05:58:16.000232,Chi,thanks! I’ll try that. is there any other reason why i’d be getting this error? is it a utf-8 error?
1074,2017-10-10T08:14:47.000169,Meg,"<@Chi>, according to <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open>"
1074,2017-10-10T08:18:06.000201,Meg,but it seems to be the file you’re opening doesn’t support UTF enccoding
1074,2017-10-10T08:34:08.000160,Young,"It's encoding error. Looks like you are using windows, this only system that uses another encoding by default. So answer above will help. Also, you can explicitly use utf8 by calling
```
import sys  

reload(sys)  
sys.setdefaultencoding('utf8')
```"
1075,2017-10-10T08:14:57.000013,Meg,"&gt;encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever locale.getpreferredencoding() returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings."
1075,2017-10-10T14:30:27.000442,Machelle,Can you install different python versions side by side?
1075,2017-10-10T14:32:07.000375,Frieda,_sorta_
1075,2017-10-10T14:32:54.000381,Machelle,Looks like you can have 2* and 3* but not two different 3* versions. Does that sound correct?
1075,2017-10-10T14:33:43.000384,Suzie,you can totally with conda
1075,2017-10-10T14:33:44.000544,Patty,You can have every single version of python if you so wish
1075,2017-10-10T14:33:56.000632,Suzie,`conda create -n myenv python=3.4` (see <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>)
1075,2017-10-10T14:34:03.000063,Frieda,pyenv works great for multiple versions
1075,2017-10-10T14:34:06.000119,Frieda,"or, yeah, conda"
1075,2017-10-10T14:34:44.000536,Machelle,sounds good. thanks :wink:
1075,2017-10-10T14:58:17.000130,Shirl,"Good evening! I’m currently working on tkinter UI which takes input from another program running opencv and a lot of video analysis, the output also shown by opencv and matplotlib as a graph. The problem is when i activate my video analysis program, the matplotlib program takes a break and stays inactivate until video analysis program stops. 
I’ve been reading that normal way to solve these kinds of problems is with threading. I don’t know much about advanced python topics yet so i ask does anybody care to show/tell me how structure to a program like that would look like.
Btw, the way i test my code now is by running two different consoles. Where in first console opencv process video and stores data to a txt file while matplotlib running in another console reading that txt file and plotting graphs simultaneously.
Thanks"

1078,2017-10-11T00:31:07.000062,Glynda,<@Margeret> It looks like that site is using JavaScript to override the form submission. Would mechanize really have worked for that in the first place?
1078,2017-10-11T00:32:16.000183,Glynda,Selenium should work for what you are trying to do.

1079,2017-10-11T04:01:15.000218,Leif,Hi there guys! Hey i have a question. Why would i used docker while building a python app web-app? I've read some blogs and they advice to do so due the dependencies. However i haven't been able to find non-hacky way to do it. So should i should i add docker since the bigining of my project or not? Thanks in advance!
1079,2017-10-11T04:03:49.000024,Young,"At first with docker  you will have same environment for all set up. This is main point because ever if you develop on ubuntu, have staging on ubuntu and production on ubuntu, they are differ and it's to hard for support.

p.s. you can read more in ""The Optimal Django Environment
Setup"" from Two Scoops of Django book."
1079,2017-10-11T04:06:27.000047,Leif,I see! You are right. Thanks a lot. Is there a good tutorial or book in docker you may recommend aditional to that one?
1079,2017-10-11T04:06:29.000216,Leif,Thanks a lot!
1079,2017-10-11T04:09:19.000168,Young,"try to read chapter from book that i mention in previous message. This is good for start. Of course will be better if you buy book for authors support (this is great book, one of the best about Django) or you can search it here <http://gen.lib.rus.ec|gen.lib.rus.ec>"
1079,2017-10-11T04:10:41.000311,Vada,"<@Leif> not sure finding a ""hacky way to do it"" is the best way to go about it :wink:"
1079,2017-10-11T04:11:26.000253,Leif,<@Young> Wow thanks a lot! And well hey im sorry i i ask a lot but which framework would you recomend me to get started with? Django or Flask? I'm just learning and i've been looking into flask but i'm really not sure
1079,2017-10-11T04:14:24.000388,Leif,"<@Vada> Oh yeah you are right. Sorry, i totally got that wrong there. I meant that every way i found to go about it was hacky and i'm really not sure about them. Haha. Thanks!"
1079,2017-10-11T04:14:42.000087,Young,"Flask is a micro framework and you must know a lot things before can build good architecture with it. Django is more complex and have a lot of good practice inside, it definitely better for starting. And looks like today both of them is must have for python developer. But if you know python and know django, working with flask will be easy."
1079,2017-10-11T04:15:37.000041,Vada,That makes more sense :stuck_out_tongue: what had you found?
1079,2017-10-11T04:19:01.000453,Leif,Ohhh okey okey. Thanks a lot! then it makes sense to get started with Django. Thanks a lot.
1079,2017-10-11T04:25:14.000194,Leif,"Actually was googling about using docker and virtualenv. But big disclaimer here is that, i know just enough about python and very little about setting up web apps, and i know nothing about Docker. And i really did not know were to start. I might need to study docker more and also the framework i'm going to use. For now i was googling if i should used virtualenv inside of my docker img in a python project. But again that might be too advance or idk yet. What do you recommend me to study first <@Vada>?"
1079,2017-10-11T04:26:33.000517,Vada,In local development I would generally just use a virtualenv
1079,2017-10-11T04:26:52.000078,Vada,when you are ready for prod get a Docker setup and make sure it works before pushing it to prod
1079,2017-10-11T04:26:58.000033,Vada,virtuallenv and docker is unecessary
1079,2017-10-11T04:27:22.000071,Vada,"Docker in itself is - to an extent - it's own virtual environment, so adding virtualenv inside of docker just complicates things"
1079,2017-10-11T04:29:34.000126,Leif,"Thanks! well yeah i just read some blogs they were actually arguing due they thought it was a ""good practice"" and i was like... Hee nope."
1079,2017-10-11T04:29:37.000039,Leif,So i rather ask
1079,2017-10-11T04:39:04.000412,Vada,Yeah people who argue good practice without understanding why it is good practice need to be a bit of research
1079,2017-10-11T05:00:37.000457,Leif,Yeah i'll make sure to always research first and ask. Thanks man. Peace out. it's 4 am over here :anguished: haha Have a good one.
1079,2017-10-11T05:02:13.000486,Leif,"And well before i leave. I'll leave this resource i found about learning docker in a more interactive way. It might be helpful for someone.

1085,2017-10-11T13:27:13.000599,Sarina,"Hullo Whirled! 
So I'm returning to Python after about a 15 year absence... :slightly_smiling_face: So I'm effectively starting over... 
I'm trying to figure out how ""max"" calculates the way it does.
I have a list:
car = ['chevy' , 'Ford', 'Lotus' , 'Aston Martin']
When I ask:
&gt;&gt;&gt; max (car)
'chevy'
That was unexpected to me... Why not 'Aston Martin'? Or does max only work on integer values and is barfing on my query?"
1085,2017-10-11T13:29:27.000556,Ciera,`max` on a string return the last alphabetical letter
1085,2017-10-11T13:29:45.000314,Ciera,so I guess in this case it does it on all of them and them max the letter
1085,2017-10-11T13:29:47.000246,Sarina,Same for list then?
1085,2017-10-11T13:29:54.000440,Ciera,and `y` is the last one
1085,2017-10-11T13:30:20.000137,Sarina,"So... if I had a ""Zebra"" car (?!) that would probably win?"
1085,2017-10-11T13:30:24.000184,Ciera,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; max(('abcy', 'abcz'))
'abcz'
```"
1085,2017-10-11T13:30:40.000673,Jodie,"im guessing it treats the string as an array of characters and it takes the ""highest"" character?"
1085,2017-10-11T13:31:01.000315,Ciera,anyways I don't really see the point of doing that :smile:
1085,2017-10-11T13:31:16.000520,Sarina,Hopefully not the most ignorant neophyte question...  Thanks!
1085,2017-10-11T13:31:35.000450,Ciera,ah no problem. It's always fun to lookup that kind of trivia
1085,2017-10-11T13:31:52.000345,Sarina,"Just was reviewing some list operator and gave it a whirl, and was not expecting that result."
1085,2017-10-11T13:32:16.000298,Sarina,Take away lesson: Use max on list with caution!
1085,2017-10-11T13:32:39.000371,Sarina,Or experiment a bit to get a more solid understanding
1085,2017-10-11T13:32:40.000353,Ciera,max on a list take the max of the list
1085,2017-10-11T13:32:48.000579,Ciera,it depends what the list is made of
1085,2017-10-11T13:33:05.000089,Ciera,it's especially weird when you start to mix type
1085,2017-10-11T13:34:20.000381,Sarina,"Thanks guys, I appreciate it!"
1086,2017-10-11T16:43:11.000226,Delicia,"<@Sarina>: If you're expecting Aston Martin as the longest, you can do that: `max(car, key=len)`"

1087,2017-10-12T04:07:44.000220,Vada,<@Malorie> every invoice will be different as many places don't format them the same. So it's going to have to be a unique solution to your invoices
1087,2017-10-12T04:56:44.000055,Malorie,<@Vada> there is a library called invoice2data
1087,2017-10-12T04:56:57.000211,Malorie,but i am unable to correctly use it
1087,2017-10-12T04:57:55.000029,Vada,<@Malorie> you will have to provide more detail than thhat :slightly_smiling_face:
1087,2017-10-12T05:01:02.000308,Malorie,sure
1087,2017-10-12T05:01:34.000438,Malorie,so i used PDFMiner as the library depends on pdf2text which wasnt working for some reason
1087,2017-10-12T05:02:04.000168,Malorie,"post using PDFMiner, i have been able to extract pdf info in text format"
1087,2017-10-12T05:02:23.000264,Malorie,then i modified the library a little bit to accept text data
1087,2017-10-12T05:02:27.000351,Malorie,all that is fine
1087,2017-10-12T05:02:52.000201,Malorie,the library expects me to write a yaml template for a particular companys invoice

1087,2017-10-12T05:03:22.000470,Malorie,and information is extracted using regex in yaml file
1087,2017-10-12T05:03:31.000107,Malorie,i am attaching an example
1087,2017-10-12T05:03:48.000356,Malorie,but the parsing doesnt happen and it gives an error
1087,2017-10-12T05:04:54.000455,Malorie,above is yaml file created by me
1087,2017-10-12T05:05:00.000338,Malorie,similar to one expected by them

My lambda handler is in a file called property_endpoint.py and the handler function is called api_get_properties,  I have this set up in the lambda console.

At the top of property_endpoint.py i import some extra things, like this
```import logging
from typing import Optional
from custom_exceptions.custom_exceptions import *
from property_package.mproperty import MProperty
from property_package.property_manager import PropertyManager```

But when i try to test the function it fails with the error `Unable to import module 'property_endpoint': cannot import name 'MProperty'`
mproperty.py is in a folder called property_package and i have an __init__.py in there. 
The top of that file look like this 
```import json
from property_package.property_manager import PropertyManager


class MProperty:```

It doesn't complain about the other one - custom_exceptions which i seem to be importing in the same way :confused:

Can anyone spot anything wrong here?"

1089,2017-10-12T07:58:14.000084,Desire,`eq_x = lambda g: g.update({'pnl':'NA'}) if (len(g) != 0) `
1089,2017-10-12T08:01:13.000132,Vada,how do you use `eq_x`?
1089,2017-10-12T08:02:26.000322,Vada,you also can't use if in a lambda
1089,2017-10-12T08:02:52.000472,Vada,actually that is wrong you can do this
1089,2017-10-12T08:03:00.000005,Vada,`a = lambda g: g.update({'pnl':'NA'}) if (len(g) != 0) else None`

```
from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk

class GUIManager(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.mainMenu()

    def mainMenu(self):
        root = Tk()

        # WIDGETS
        l1 = Label(header, text = 'BibliotePy - Coded By: @alfonsoima', bg = 'red', fg = 'blue')

        # INCLUDE
        l1.pack(fill = X)
        header.pack()
        root.mainloop()

    def quitEverything(self):
        sys.exit(0)
```
and, when I run it, Tkinter prints this: (image uploading...)"
1095,2017-10-12T15:46:49.000232,Lana,My question is about the `fill = X` It seems to not work properly... Any ideas?
1095,2017-10-12T15:55:08.000159,Antionette,"Not super familiar with tkinter so this might be off, but fill=X makes the widget as wide as its parent, which in this case is the header, but you are not also filling the header to be as wide as its parent (root).  If you wanted to label to take up the full space of the main frame you might also have to set fill=X for the header packing as well"

1097,2017-10-12T19:18:36.000144,Antionette,<@Carolina> does the problem say anything explicit about grouping in two or do you need to separate the string on the commas no matter how many digits each number is?  If you have the input as a string here is the documentation for all of the builtin string functions - <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods>

1102,2017-10-13T09:07:16.000319,Meg,part of the problem with converting pdfs is you have to rely on heuristics
1102,2017-10-13T09:07:45.000503,Meg,"since in that file, each and every word there is simply composed of single characters with font, letter and possition information"
1102,2017-10-13T09:08:01.000273,Meg,PDFs don’t have the concept of structure that you can easily parse
1102,2017-10-13T09:08:13.000244,Meg,unlike word/openoffice documents
1102,2017-10-13T09:08:37.000550,Meg,"so, to be honest, it is highly unlikely that you’ll find a solution to work for all your documents"
1102,2017-10-13T09:09:13.000040,Meg,"in fact, I’d be surprised if there’s a better than 90% success rate, particularly giving the sheer variability of ways that PDF authoring software outputs the files"
1102,2017-10-13T09:11:39.000290,Tandra,ive seen it accomplished with ocr  <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytesseract>
1102,2017-10-13T09:11:59.000654,Malorie,<@Meg> do you think there is any other way an invoice(a real physical paper invoice) be converted to a csv with all the data extracted
1102,2017-10-13T09:12:07.000310,Tandra,only ever had a play once at reading pdf’s but it worked for me
1102,2017-10-13T09:13:16.000118,Johana,there are applications that can help you read pdfs. mayan-edms is an electronic document management system and does ocr on any documents that it imports. you can then use its api to extract data.
1102,2017-10-13T09:13:34.000357,Johana,<https://www.mayan-edms.com/>
1102,2017-10-13T09:14:16.000044,Johana,"btw, it’s a django app."
1102,2017-10-13T09:15:17.000113,Johana,the web api uses DRF and swagger.
1102,2017-10-13T09:16:36.000602,Meg,"so, <@Malorie> there are some options available.  but ‘simple’ is definitely not part of them"
1102,2017-10-13T09:16:51.000294,Malorie,dont need it super simple
1102,2017-10-13T09:17:05.000212,Malorie,but not so complex that i would rather write my own package
1102,2017-10-13T09:18:14.000051,Malorie,<@Johana>  so i need to figure out how to run electronic document management
1102,2017-10-13T09:18:58.000248,Johana,"ok so then you would need to deploy mayan-edms. you could use docker, a vps, an old laptop, or install it locally."
1102,2017-10-13T09:19:48.000107,Johana,you give it a folder to watch and then you drop files in and it will suck them up and create a bunch of metadata you can read about the file.
1102,2017-10-13T09:20:47.000506,Johana,i keep no paper documents at home. i use mayan-edms to manage all my documents.
1102,2017-10-13T09:21:20.000386,Ciera,<@Johana> stuff like that look interesting but it seems so hard to maintain
1102,2017-10-13T09:21:57.000243,Johana,i run the server on an old laptop and haven’t looked at it since lol.
1102,2017-10-13T09:22:14.000063,Ciera,hmm I should look into that (and buy a scanner :stuck_out_tongue: )
1102,2017-10-13T09:23:57.000325,Ciera,you use it only on a local network ?
1102,2017-10-13T09:23:59.000297,Johana,"it’s been like 2 years. the funny thing is when i first set it up i was building onto my home and when the contractors and i finished signing all the documents, I told them to hold on one minute. I dropped them in the scanner and mayan-edms automatically brought them up. I have a PC in the living room and brought up the docs for them to see. In other words, i was saying there is no way i’m losing the contract."
1102,2017-10-13T09:24:01.000049,Johana,yea
1102,2017-10-13T09:24:31.000418,Johana,you can search for any text and it will find the right doc.
1102,2017-10-13T09:24:39.000640,Ciera,I'll look into it
1102,2017-10-13T09:24:52.000383,Ciera,just need to find a scanner that can upload to the cloud next
1102,2017-10-13T09:25:49.000614,Ciera,ouh they provide a docker image shouldn't be too hard to put in a VM then
1103,2017-10-13T09:52:28.000328,Mirian,"I'm trying to setup API integrations tests using Runscope. Unfortunately, I need file upload for this. I've found info that ```The request editor does not support uploading files. However, some customers have been able to make file uploads work by pasting in a raw multipart-formatted body or unicode string input body into the request and making sure to include the applicable 'Content-type' header value with the correct boundaries. ``` (<https://www.runscope.com/support/kb/multipart-file-uploads>) I'm having trouble to construct this `raw multipart-formatted body`."
1103,2017-10-13T09:52:44.000402,Mirian,does anybody have an idea how it should look?
1103,2017-10-13T10:13:07.000249,Meg,<@Mirian> I would make a valid post to that api
1103,2017-10-13T10:13:21.000103,Meg,with the browser dev tools open
1103,2017-10-13T10:13:31.000077,Meg,"see what data goes out, and how its formatted"
1103,2017-10-13T10:13:46.000392,Meg,that would give you clues how to do it in your integration tests
1103,2017-10-13T10:18:53.000212,Mirian,"that's what I'm trying to do, but the file i receive is somehow broken :stuck_out_tongue:"
1103,2017-10-13T10:26:47.000240,Meg,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1104,2017-10-13T10:33:56.000276,Meghan,"Had never heard of mayan-edms, that does look nice. Might just set that up. <@Johana> is it difficult to set up? Looks like just a docker image."
1104,2017-10-13T10:34:30.000128,Johana,i installed it locally on an old laptop and it wasn’t difficult but I have deployed django apps before.
1104,2017-10-13T10:34:45.000727,Johana,if you check the ecosystem you will see an ansible playbook i made.
1104,2017-10-13T10:35:03.000414,Johana,with docker it should be a breeze.
1104,2017-10-13T10:35:42.000342,Meghan,Is there an Android app where I can take a pic while I'm out on my phone and have it automatically put into the system?
1104,2017-10-13T10:36:05.000520,Johana,i have no idea.
1104,2017-10-13T10:36:23.000415,Johana,its for documents so you could move the document from your phone to a folder that mayan is watching.
1104,2017-10-13T10:36:50.000644,Johana,i don’t think you want to use it for photo management.
1104,2017-10-13T10:37:18.000699,Meghan,"Not for photo management, but using phone as alternative to scanner while out. Say if I drop off a package at UPS and I want the receipt in the system."
1104,2017-10-13T10:37:26.000329,Johana,but if you took a photo of a document then i would do that
1104,2017-10-13T10:37:46.000495,Johana,yea i know what you meant. i was just saying that you probably don’t want it watching for every photo.
1104,2017-10-13T10:38:21.000060,Meghan,"Oh, yeah, not that. I was thinking an app that would take the photo and upload. Not scan all of my photos."
1104,2017-10-13T10:38:24.000544,Johana,i already use bittorrent sync so i would probably use that.
1104,2017-10-13T10:38:41.000756,Johana,you could create a folder that bitttorrent sync is keeping up to date that mayan is watching.
1104,2017-10-13T10:38:49.000177,Meghan,"Yeah, that would work."
1104,2017-10-13T10:39:06.000459,Johana,you can provide mayan multiple locations for it to watch.
1104,2017-10-13T10:39:13.000144,Johana,in the background it is all celery tasks.
1104,2017-10-13T10:39:21.000482,Johana,with a nice web frontend.
1104,2017-10-13T10:39:56.000389,Johana,<@Meghan> i’m sure there has to be an app b/c it has a really nice web api.
1104,2017-10-13T10:40:25.000007,Luetta,"Hi, I also have this error or similar 

` Caused by SSLError(SSLError(""bad handshake: SysCallError(-1, 'Unexpected EOF')"",),)) `"
1104,2017-10-13T10:40:26.000122,Johana,how could someone not make one when it provides all the tools? i guess it could still be without.
1104,2017-10-13T10:41:19.000056,Meghan,Sounds like it would beat the scansnap software. :wink: Thanks for the suggestions.
1104,2017-10-13T10:42:12.000393,Johana,"yea, and it’s python!"
1104,2017-10-13T10:50:31.000419,Sirena,"<@Luetta> I think you'll need to provide a little more background, under what circumstances did you come across that error?"
1105,2017-10-13T11:43:40.000069,Burma,has anyone ever seen this with python requests ```Cannot find a Content-Type supported by your client. python```
1105,2017-10-13T11:44:30.000440,Burma,trying to set  payload with ```Content-Type application/json```
1105,2017-10-13T11:45:17.000023,Collette,<@Burma> show us your code
1105,2017-10-13T11:46:03.000450,Burma,"```#!/usr/bin/env python

1105,2017-10-13T11:46:27.000699,Meg,you don’t need to use json.dumps
1105,2017-10-13T11:46:35.000186,Meg,just `data = payload`
1105,2017-10-13T11:47:10.000454,Meg,<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#more-complicated-post-requests>

1105,2017-10-13T11:48:18.000099,Burma,Thanks I'll Give it a kick
1105,2017-10-13T11:50:58.000053,Burma,Nice it worked :+1:
1105,2017-10-13T11:51:40.000092,Meghan,"Also, why are you defining headers as an empty dict? You aren't using it either, or at least not in this snippet"
1105,2017-10-13T11:52:52.000345,Burma,The Question is should I be using payload or headers ?
1105,2017-10-13T11:53:06.000180,Burma,we have to define the header fields using postman
1105,2017-10-13T11:53:08.000495,Seema,<@Malorie> Did you ever get the pdf situation figured out?  Our local Python meetup last night had a speaker talk about it.  (Looking for link)
1105,2017-10-13T11:53:11.000514,Meghan,That depends on what the server is expecting.
1105,2017-10-13T11:53:51.000379,Meghan,"Headers would likely include things like api-keys, I believe. Where as the form content I think would typically be in payload."
1105,2017-10-13T11:54:20.000306,Meghan,Then you'll want to add headers=headers to your <http://requests.post|requests.post> call.
1105,2017-10-13T11:55:51.000369,Meghan,"csv.DictReader seems to not support what I was hoping for. May have to extend it some day. Was thinking it would be nice to read a csv, determine if it is headered, if so use those, if not use specified. I could see where it could be error prone though."
1105,2017-10-13T11:56:39.000736,Burma,Thanks I'll give that a try as well for the post call
1105,2017-10-13T12:06:32.000315,Ciera,<@Meghan> you could determine yourself if the first raw are headers or not
1105,2017-10-13T12:06:38.000666,Ciera,and then use the reader you want for each
1105,2017-10-13T12:08:42.000033,Meghan,"<@Ciera> Yeah, that is what I was thinking."
1105,2017-10-13T12:16:38.000626,Sunny,"hum not really, or I miss something <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_transaction.html>"
1105,2017-10-13T12:20:42.000267,Ciera,ah yeah didn't know it was sqlalchemy :slightly_smiling_face: my bad
1105,2017-10-13T12:21:04.000424,Ciera,and yeah it's possible with mock
1105,2017-10-13T12:21:20.000519,Ciera,you need to use `side_effect` I believe

    try:

In test, to get 100% coverage how to make `db.session.commit()` generate an exception, is it possible with `mock` library ? I'm a little bit lost :confused:"
1106,2017-10-13T12:07:27.000422,Ciera,"wouldn't something like

1107,2017-10-13T13:34:11.000154,Asley,"Hi guys, bit stuck here. Trying to append user input integers into an empty list, and for the program to tell me if the numbers 1,2,3 are in that list. Here’s my code:

```def main():
    print(""This program will ask the user to enter a list of integers and will check if the numbers 1, 2, and 3 are contained within that list."")

    n = eval(input(""How many numbers will the list have?""))

    control = [1, 2, 3]

    A = []

    for i in range (n):

        A.append(input(""Please enter a number: ""))

    if control in A:

        print(""Yes"")

    else:

        print(""No"")

main()```

The program is running, but I think it’s not appending to A, as checking if control is in A for input (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) outputs `no`"
1108,2017-10-13T13:38:22.000282,Meg,"so you have a list, and you want to see if a value from that list exists in another list?"
1108,2017-10-13T13:38:55.000364,Meg,"`in` only works when you have `value’ on the left and an iterable data structure like a list, set, dict, etc on the right"
1108,2017-10-13T13:39:57.000398,Asley,I want to see if all values in a list (control) are in another list (the one made of the integers the user inputs)
1108,2017-10-13T13:40:24.000064,Asley,"But if I’m not wrong, those inputs should be a list themselves as I am asking for them to be appended"
1108,2017-10-13T13:40:27.000661,Asley,"However, I think I’m doing it wrong"
1108,2017-10-13T13:40:42.000360,Frieda,"`input` will give you strings, so `A` will be a list of strings"
1108,2017-10-13T13:40:50.000309,Frieda,while `control` is a list of ints
1108,2017-10-13T13:40:51.000002,Asley,You’re correct
1108,2017-10-13T13:40:59.000449,Asley,What an idiotic mistake on my behalf
1108,2017-10-13T13:41:03.000336,Asley,Thank you
1108,2017-10-13T13:41:09.000508,Frieda,not idiotic at all
1108,2017-10-13T13:42:10.000067,Meg,"furthermore, what you’re trying to do requires use of `all`"
1108,2017-10-13T13:42:27.000535,Meg,as in do all these values in `control` exist in `A`?
1108,2017-10-13T13:42:27.000536,Frieda,i'd personally use sets
1108,2017-10-13T13:42:38.000259,Frieda,wouldn't require any iteration
1108,2017-10-13T13:42:49.000395,Meg,"true, or list comprehension"
1108,2017-10-13T13:43:00.000382,Asley,Am I able to order numbers in a set?
1108,2017-10-13T13:43:11.000545,Frieda,listcomp would be back to using a `for` loop though
1108,2017-10-13T13:43:26.000391,Frieda,"no, you can't order numbers in a set but i'm only talking about the comparison"
1108,2017-10-13T13:43:39.000115,Frieda,you'd leave `A` and `control` alone except for the `if`

1108,2017-10-13T13:45:24.000619,Frieda,sets are just cleaner

1115,2017-10-13T21:43:51.000048,Meg,Not sure 
1115,2017-10-13T21:43:57.000104,Meg,Have you looked at pint?
1115,2017-10-13T21:44:00.000066,Meg,<https://github.com/hgrecco/pint>
1116,2017-10-14T02:06:46.000010,Glynda,"<@Kenny> some suggestions:
When iterating through the keys of a dictionary, you can write
`for key in dict:`
instead of
`for key in dict.keys():`
If you are using both the key and the value in the loop you may want to consider
`for key, value in dict.items():`

`string[0] == '1'`
feels more natural than
`int(string[0]) == 1`

If you replace the first element of teens with 'ten', you can get simplify parse_two somewhat.

When you are using a list as a constant (like ones, teens, and tens), consider using a tuple instead.

I'd probably move the stringified_int line into the split function and create a new helper function for the building of the string itself. The reason I want to do this is to try to maintain a single level of abstraction in each of our functions.

I think it might be nicer if instead of creating a dictionary with 'hundred', 'thousand', and 'million' as keys, we put them in a list or tuple like you did for ones, teens, and tens.

Here's how it might look: <https://repl.it/McUI>.
Overall, I like your approach and it looks good already! Some of my suggestions might be kind of opinionated."

1119,2017-10-14T21:55:19.000028,Myong,"Nevermind, fixed it. Turns out the hardcoded style will not change so I removed that on the element and added another media query with min-width"

1121,2017-10-15T12:54:19.000078,Shakita,"hello, this google api stt is some neat stuff but i am having trouble wrapping the example in some threading to keep it going. While a minute of speech to text is neat i would like to get hours of audio on a mic streamed to a text file or database. It seems like links are okay so ill paste the original here as it is from git... 

<https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/blob/master/speech/cloud-client/transcribe_streaming_mic.py>

To this i added a line and get some long term transcription to happen but eventually things bomb out or crash. 
def main():
  threading.Timer(35.0, main).start()

I believe i need to setup some services to run the mic to a stream and pass that to another thread that is keeping the google api connection open while another takes the response from google and writes to a text file/db.... So far getting everything together is beyond me and i am hopeful some folks have time/experience to help me piece something together.  (thanks)"
1121,2017-10-15T13:01:37.000152,Patty,"<@Shakita> google’s API library is not thread safe, so you cannot use threads for your solution"
1121,2017-10-15T13:03:01.000033,Shakita,oh... didn't even think to check on that; and it prolly says in some red line on the top of everything i have been reading **not thread safe**
1121,2017-10-15T13:08:50.000056,Shakita,"thinking... 

so i would like to keep the pyadio stream buffering and pass it to google api which will drop out every 30 to 60 seconds. I suppose i could have a loop that handles a graceful restart of the api connection... now instead of trying to do that inside a thread i just need to figure out that graceful restart while pulling in the mic buffer"

1122,2017-10-15T15:26:30.000049,Charisse,I am using MacOS 12.6
1122,2017-10-15T15:40:11.000081,Charisse,<@Meg> I think there is a problem in settings.py.   loading env file part.
1122,2017-10-15T15:50:33.000032,Meg,what happens when you `echo $SECRET_KEY`
1122,2017-10-15T15:56:30.000064,Charisse,it shows nothing.
1122,2017-10-15T15:56:39.000087,Meg,that’s your problem
1122,2017-10-15T15:57:02.000006,Meg,the settings is looking for that environment variable
1122,2017-10-15T15:57:14.000008,Meg,"since it doesn’t exist, it throws that error"
1122,2017-10-15T15:57:24.000110,Meg,its up to you to export the env var to your environment
1122,2017-10-15T16:01:14.000037,Charisse,"I can't understand, it used environ module on settings.py and used variables from .env file.

1122,2017-10-15T16:02:44.000022,Meg,I came across this same issue with using django-environ
1122,2017-10-15T16:03:04.000011,Meg,and ended up throwing that project out in favor of using a json env file locally and reading it from settings
1122,2017-10-15T16:03:57.000103,Charisse,so how can I solve this?
1122,2017-10-15T16:04:17.000120,Meg,no clue.  I just went with an adaptation of this ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1122,2017-10-15T16:04:18.000069,Meg,<https://github.com/twoscoops/two-scoops-of-django-1.8/blob/master/code/chapter_05_example_19.py>
1122,2017-10-15T16:04:29.000081,Meg,got rid of django-environ completely
1123,2017-10-15T16:56:24.000025,Shakita,<@Patty> i think (based on logging outputting the thread info) that the example from google for python and the api is using threading.
1123,2017-10-15T16:57:11.000016,Jesusa,does anyone have experience wanting to run 2 event loops ~_~
1123,2017-10-15T16:57:22.000106,Jesusa,"well, I don't really want but yea..."
1123,2017-10-15T16:57:31.000002,Jesusa,python-xlib has its own event loop
1123,2017-10-15T16:57:51.000027,Jesusa,but I want to run a bunch of other stuff in an asyncio loop
1123,2017-10-15T17:01:57.000017,Jesusa,it uses locks
1123,2017-10-15T17:02:02.000092,Jesusa,<https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib/blob/eb3f4b70671afa09cdd38b43d7cb5e38d92f63a7/Xlib/protocol/display.py#L157>
1123,2017-10-15T17:08:30.000004,Jesusa,with the blocking nature I think it makes sense that I need a thread
1124,2017-10-15T17:42:25.000065,Patty,<@Shakita> <https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/thread_safety>
1124,2017-10-15T17:45:52.000033,Shakita,i don't think i am using google-api-python-client which i believe that to be about
1124,2017-10-15T17:46:16.000005,Shakita,but maybe everything i am using eventually goes back to that as it is python and the google api...
1124,2017-10-15T17:46:56.000016,Patty,"<@Jesusa> I’ve seen two asycio event loops run in separate threads. If you’re not sharing data between them it’s even easier, but otherwise you may have to implement your own mutexes. I haven’t done it myself and only tried multiple event loops in node"
1124,2017-10-15T17:47:31.000135,Shakita,i think i am getting the looping to happen in an acceptable manner... had to add a check on time at the start of streaming to gcloud and then close if i was gt 45 seconds later.
1124,2017-10-15T17:51:30.000056,Patty,So then I’m assuming you’re using the google cloud client?
1124,2017-10-15T17:52:31.000012,Patty,It’s still not thread safe. They are working on moving the back end libraries to be thread safe 
1124,2017-10-15T18:01:08.000054,Shakita,"yes google cloud client, alright thanks"
1124,2017-10-15T18:09:21.000054,Jesusa,"<@Patty> I've now packaged one of the loops in a thread, asyncio running in main"
1124,2017-10-15T18:10:08.000048,Jesusa,"on some event in the thread loop, it will send a task to the asyncio loop"
1124,2017-10-15T18:10:15.000057,Jesusa,does that sound safe?
1124,2017-10-15T18:11:24.000069,Jesusa,"`t = Thread(target=x_event, args=[lambda x: loop.create_task(async_test(x))])`"
1124,2017-10-15T18:12:23.000032,Jesusa,I will make the auto brightness fully event driven :slightly_smiling_face:
1124,2017-10-15T18:12:55.000082,Jesusa,"instead of requiring people to bind keys to my script, I am monitoring the brightness"
1124,2017-10-15T18:13:03.000102,Jesusa,"and if a user changed it, then it becomes a training sample"
1124,2017-10-15T18:13:38.000030,Jesusa,"x11 event loop, generic loop, inotify event loop"
1124,2017-10-15T18:13:42.000018,Jesusa,ridiculous :smile:
1124,2017-10-15T18:13:58.000036,Jesusa,though inotify runs nicely with the other generic things
1124,2017-10-15T18:14:57.000093,Jesusa,though i'm not sure what the hit will be on performance given that there is threading
1124,2017-10-16T05:52:24.000283,Ronald,Anyone know how to set a python environment on an offline server with no pip install. I can only transfer files and exeutables through a cloud storage . Is it a matter of using the tar.gz files for each package or can it be done using anaconda?
1124,2017-10-16T05:55:27.000245,Ciera,pip can install local packages if you supply the path
1124,2017-10-16T05:55:38.000486,Ciera,I'm not sure it's possible to package a whole environment easily
1124,2017-10-16T05:56:45.000158,Collette,<@Ronald> are you on linux?
1124,2017-10-16T06:00:56.000053,Ronald,Windows

1126,2017-10-16T10:39:28.000778,Ciera,or do you need it to be read by a downstream program ?
1126,2017-10-16T10:39:50.000267,Scot,It's not by choice I should point out
1126,2017-10-16T10:40:27.000198,Ciera,I'm sorry but just to be clear. Would logging everything directly to a file be ok ?
1126,2017-10-16T10:40:40.000305,Scot,It would not in this case
1126,2017-10-16T10:41:10.000582,Ciera,ok
1126,2017-10-16T10:43:16.000297,Ciera,I'm not sure you can redirect exception output to something else than stderr. You could either read from stdout and stderr in your downstream program or do a big `try` `Except` and `LOG.exception`
1126,2017-10-16T10:44:34.000302,Scot,I did look at redirecting stderr to stdout but it looked and felt wrong. The downstream program is unfortunately not something I can modify so i'm sort of stuck with this venture
1126,2017-10-16T10:45:24.000130,Ciera,I would do a big try except then
1126,2017-10-16T10:45:31.000264,Ciera,or maybe someone else as a better idea
1126,2017-10-16T10:45:32.000719,Sirena,"so I'm confused, you don't want to redirect, but you want your stdout and stderr to go to a file?"
1126,2017-10-16T10:47:29.000046,Scot,"Currently, all logging is sent to stdout. In the event of a script crash, i need to error to also go to stdout. I'm guessing I need to redirect here, but what I found so far looked really hacky, but I suppose that's the way to do it."
1126,2017-10-16T10:49:32.000282,Scot,"Although, it might not be possible at all without some giant try/except as already mentioned?"
1126,2017-10-16T10:50:07.000577,Sirena,do you only want error to go to stdout when a script crash occurs?
1126,2017-10-16T10:50:17.000403,Ciera,"if it's only when your script crash you could do 
```
try:
  main()
Except:
  ...
```"
1126,2017-10-16T10:50:35.000381,Ciera,it doesn't feel that hackish to me
1126,2017-10-16T10:51:10.000441,Sirena,I agree with <@Ciera>
1126,2017-10-16T10:53:52.000324,Scot,"I suppose you're right. It just looks like a lot of repeating try/except due to it being a `click` initiated script with increasing numbers of subcommands, where the context class created initiates the logging. Might just be due to my stupid setup but i'll give it a go. Thanks!"
1126,2017-10-16T10:54:50.000048,Ciera,I'm not entirely familiar with click but maybe you can set it up before calling your subcommands ?
1126,2017-10-16T10:55:07.000564,Ciera,or passing the subcommand as an arg to the try/except func
1126,2017-10-16T10:55:09.000614,Scot,"Ye, should be doable but then I'd have to break the logging out of the context class"
1126,2017-10-16T10:56:08.000337,Scot,I'll play around with it a bit and see where I end up. Thanks a lot for the input
1126,2017-10-16T11:07:22.000115,Meghan,"I've started doing this on scripts to make sure any unhandled exception is in the logs. That way I don't have to rely on users for anything other than emailing me the log. (Haven't automated log uploads yet.)

```
try:
  main()
except Exception:
  log.exception()
```"
1126,2017-10-16T11:10:30.000808,Scot,<@Meghan> I'm attempting this now but it seems a bit weird with click and its subcommands
1126,2017-10-16T11:11:53.000115,Scot,"I'm trying to at the top level, but as I said, click seems to be acting weird. Won't return the exception from the subcommand"
1126,2017-10-16T11:12:37.000614,Scot,"Where the error should be, I instead get an empty message"
1126,2017-10-16T11:14:40.000381,Scot,"It enters the except clause, but my `except Exception as e` gives an empty e"
1126,2017-10-16T11:18:41.000355,Scot,"Ah crap, I've gotta run... Wife's gonna murder me if i'm late. Thanks for the input though! I've got some ideas for tomorrow"
1127,2017-10-16T11:08:09.000302,Marilyn,Why not use opbeat?
1127,2017-10-16T11:09:35.000463,Meghan,Never heard of it. What is it?
1127,2017-10-16T11:11:03.000047,Meghan,"I've not used click, but I would assume you run a function that dispatches to other functions, right?"
1127,2017-10-16T11:11:15.000063,Scot,Pretty much yes
1127,2017-10-16T11:11:23.000015,Meghan,Then wrap that call with the try/except.
1127,2017-10-16T11:14:07.000757,Meghan,You don't get the exception at all then?
1127,2017-10-16T11:15:48.000021,Meghan,What does log.exception() get?
1127,2017-10-16T11:16:29.000548,Scot,"Wait, I might be the one who effed up..."
1127,2017-10-16T11:20:02.000175,Marilyn,"<@Meghan>: it's a service that basically does what you are describing, I use it for projects all the time to get better error reporting"
1127,2017-10-16T11:20:16.000207,Meghan,I'll take a look. Thanks!
1127,2017-10-16T11:26:10.000259,Seema,Best practices question: It seems that the programmer would have to know that  generator co-routine yields 1 (or other integer) iteration each call but that the generator could be anywhere... is there some sort of good practice/convention for referencing co-routines call on a generator?
1128,2017-10-16T15:23:57.000339,Rosamond,"<@Seema> You can wrap the generator function in another function, which creates the coroutine, calls next() on it, then returns it, so you don't have to manually call next() after instantiation. The internal generator could be defined anywhere and instantiated inside the wrapper. Is that what you mean?"
1128,2017-10-16T15:39:43.000037,Seema,"<@Rosamond> Here's an example of a call to a coroutine where the code is right next to the coroutine.  I'm assuming the coroutine could be in any module/namespace.  Is that true?
```def fibonacci_co():
    current = 0
    next = 1

    while True:
        current, next = next, next + current
        yield current

for n in fibonacci_co():
    if n &gt; 1000:
        break

    print(n, end=', ')```"
1128,2017-10-16T15:41:39.000379,Seema,"if fibonacci_co or any co-routine can be somewhere else, how would programmer/user know that it would have to be iterated."
1128,2017-10-16T15:44:15.000498,Rosamond,"I would still call that a generator function since it's only yielding results, a coroutine can take arguments for each iteration and usually has an opening `yield` in the definition."
1128,2017-10-16T15:45:19.000519,Rosamond,"That's moreso what I mean. Then _coroutine could be defined anywhere. If in another namespace, just import it"
1128,2017-10-16T15:46:25.000319,Seema,"I'm under the impression that coroutines are just a special type of generator, is that right?"
1128,2017-10-16T15:46:55.000277,Rosamond,"Yeah, maybe more meaningful to say a generator is half of a coroutine :slightly_smiling_face:"
1128,2017-10-16T15:48:35.000547,Seema,"and the coroutine has a next and a generator object and ""advances"" each yield.  My question is that if this was imported and the function was consumed, how do they know it's a co-routine other than print(""Created coroutine."") and print(f""_coroutine({data})"")"
1128,2017-10-16T15:48:55.000407,Winnifred,"<@Seema>, hope that the dev provides doc strings"
1128,2017-10-16T15:49:15.000261,Seema,<@Winnifred> I think you get the gist of my question :wink:
1128,2017-10-16T15:49:24.000358,Rosamond,"That, and if you dir(coroutine()) it should have a send member."
1128,2017-10-16T15:49:38.000259,Seema,"wow, ouch, umm... okay, thanks for tip"
1128,2017-10-16T15:49:58.000241,Seema,will it have a next() or is that only in the generator object?
1128,2017-10-16T15:50:09.000576,Rosamond,Yeah. The agony and ecstacy of dynamic typing ha
1128,2017-10-16T15:51:22.000182,Seema,Time to poke and prod and learn
1128,2017-10-16T15:51:45.000176,Rosamond,Looks like there's an 'isgeneratorfunction()' in the inspect module
1128,2017-10-16T15:51:50.000319,Rosamond,to take out the guesswork :slightly_smiling_face:
1128,2017-10-16T15:52:45.000016,Winnifred,Lol
1128,2017-10-16T15:54:11.000111,Rosamond,"As far as next().. to my knowledge send() replaces it, however there may be cases where you send a single item and yield multiple outputs"
1128,2017-10-16T15:54:19.000055,Rosamond,So next may be used there?

1133,2017-10-17T08:13:58.000302,Patty,They aren’t the same size?
1133,2017-10-17T08:14:22.000087,Christin,Apparently not
1133,2017-10-17T08:14:32.000105,Christin,Im not sure what can I do in this case
1133,2017-10-17T08:14:50.000163,Christin,Im trying to build a binary classifier with 64 features
1133,2017-10-17T08:15:05.000425,Christin,So my data consists of 64 columns and 762 rows
1133,2017-10-17T08:15:20.000354,Christin,I'm not sure why do X and y have to be of the same size
1133,2017-10-17T08:21:17.000145,Patty,"No I was saying that they aren’t the same size, hence the error "
1133,2017-10-17T08:22:04.000393,Christin,Oh I'm aware of that I just don't know how to tackle that problem or why should they be of the same size
1133,2017-10-17T08:23:41.000167,Patty,What is the second dimension of y?
1133,2017-10-17T08:24:41.000385,Patty,"If there isn’t, then it’s a 1d vector and a 2d array, and they can’t be plotted together "

1133,2017-10-17T08:25:35.000188,Christin,So I guess I have to turn that into  [[8][9].. etc] ?
1133,2017-10-17T08:28:00.000336,Scot,You need to have coordinate pairs. You can't simply plot the value x=5 without a corresponding y-value.
1133,2017-10-17T08:28:05.000456,Patty,The simple way to say how to fix it is make it both the same type and size
1133,2017-10-17T08:29:02.000075,Christin,"Sure, but if every row(consisting of 64 features) has 1 y then it can never be of the same size no?"

1133,2017-10-17T08:32:15.000009,Patty,Think about it this way: how would you even plot that?
1133,2017-10-17T08:33:11.000011,Christin,I agree I can't plot that
1133,2017-10-17T08:33:23.000190,Christin,So I guess I have to add columns? columns of zeroes?
1133,2017-10-17T08:34:27.000170,Patty,I don’t know what value to give them as I don’t know what the data is or what you’re trying to accomplish 
1133,2017-10-17T08:34:54.000449,Christin,Im just trying to make a binary classifier (8 or 9 instead of 1 -1) using linear regression
1133,2017-10-17T08:35:02.000193,Christin,I just have numbers as data
1133,2017-10-17T08:35:10.000444,Christin,randomly generated
1133,2017-10-17T08:36:22.000423,Christin,"I have 65 columns, the first 64 are the features and the last one is the output (8 or 9)"
1133,2017-10-17T10:12:44.000641,Christin,"I was just splitting my training sets incorrectly, everything worked fine with i used splitting with sklearn <@Patty> <@Scot>"
1133,2017-10-17T10:12:56.000713,Christin,Thank you!
1134,2017-10-17T08:48:42.000353,Scot,Why scatterplot?
1135,2017-10-17T11:05:42.000026,Burma,hey is it possible to pass a variable within a dictionary ?
1135,2017-10-17T11:09:02.000375,Sirena,"not sure what you mean, but you can pass a dictionary"
1135,2017-10-17T11:09:36.000243,Burma,for example taking raw input and passing in to the value of a dictionary
1135,2017-10-17T11:09:37.000048,Sirena,"```adict = {}
myresult = myfunc(adict)```
is valid"
1135,2017-10-17T11:10:31.000806,Burma,"```user = raw_input('please enter username: ')
     passw = raw_input('please enter password: ')

payload = {""username"": 'user',
           ""password"": 'pass',
           ""Content-Type"":""application/json"",
}```"
1135,2017-10-17T11:11:20.000214,Ciera,if you put `'` you create the string `user` but if you don't put them you reference the variable user
1135,2017-10-17T11:12:30.000087,Sirena,"yah, you want the vars, not the strings, so remove the quotes around the varnames"
1135,2017-10-17T11:14:06.000461,Burma,Thanks for that I'll give it a try
1136,2017-10-17T11:40:30.000580,Kenny,"Hey folks. I'm a relative noob, but I've been doing some self learning for a while and I'm looking to break into a technical role.

I'm talking with a person about a position that requires ""strong Python and SQL skills"". I'm most experienced with Python, but on the main project I worked on that would have required SQL (a flask web app) , I ended up using SQLAlchemy instead of writing SQL statements. I have a basic understanding of SQL though, and could figure out more complex queries with some extra time."
1136,2017-10-17T11:40:38.000703,Kenny,"Say they see my resume, decide to call me, and ask about my SQL skills. Would it be reasonable for me to say something like, ""Well, I have a basic foundation in SQL, but perhaps to handle some more complex queries I'd set up and use SQLAlchemy""? Or would I get laughed off the phone?"
1136,2017-10-17T11:42:10.000133,Suellen,I wouldn't mention ORM until they ask
1136,2017-10-17T11:42:32.000524,Suellen,"actually don't tell them anything and only answer questions they ask you, that's a safe bet"
1136,2017-10-17T11:45:01.000047,Johana,did you use sqlalchemy orm or the core?
1136,2017-10-17T11:47:12.000198,Kenny,orm
1136,2017-10-17T11:57:04.000752,Johana,start learning the core. it will not be that hard of a jump knowing the ORM. the ORM is built on the core which at its heart is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for SQL that is written in python. The syntax is really similar to what SQL statements look like. When you feel comfortable writing SQL core queries then you can answer confidently that maybe you don’t have a lot of experience writing raw sql b/c you like to use tools that take care of parameter binding and reduce risks of sql injection. You can also say with confidence you understand what makes up SQL and don’t think it would be difficult to learn since you know sqlalchemy core and orm.
1136,2017-10-17T11:58:33.000107,Winnifred,and to add a nice resource to practice …
1136,2017-10-17T11:58:35.000099,Winnifred,<http://sqlzoo.net/>
1136,2017-10-17T11:59:23.000940,Johana,SQLAlchemy is a very useful abstraction layer on top of the database. I’m sort of the opposite. I came into SQLAlchemy from the database world so I had already nearly written applications in raw SQL. That’s one of the reasons I found Python. I needed more power!
1136,2017-10-17T11:59:55.000340,Johana,you can also dump the sqlalchemy queries and study them.
1136,2017-10-17T12:01:24.000555,Johana,i gotz all sorts of sqlalchemy tricks in here: <https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server/blob/master/sparfa_server/db.py>
1136,2017-10-17T12:02:37.000620,Johana,I’ve done plenty of interviews where i may not have been an expert on many parts of the job but if i was able to display with confidence my capability to adapt and learn then that made all the difference.
1136,2017-10-17T12:03:02.000215,Kenny,Awesome! Thanks <@Johana> for those ideas and <@Winnifred> for that resource.
1136,2017-10-17T12:04:02.000097,Kenny,"Yeah, that's what I'm banking on here. I have a foundation to work from at least, but depending on how long it takes from resume submission to phone interview, I just wanted to have _something_ to say"
1136,2017-10-17T12:07:30.000183,Johana,"yea, the safe answer is typically, “i like to use tools that take care of parameter binding and reduce risks of sql injection, like sqlalchemy which i’ve done …. yada yada .”"
1136,2017-10-17T12:12:01.000419,Johana,sqlalchemy is a cool toolkit as it doesn’t hide too much of the database away. in other ecosystems a lot of devs don’t even know what the db schema looks like.
1136,2017-10-17T12:12:39.000031,Johana,cough* .NET
1136,2017-10-17T12:12:55.000211,Suellen,h i b e r n a t e
1136,2017-10-17T12:13:40.000358,Suellen,I love SQLA for this. Once I saw that m2m tables are not abstracted away I fell for Alchemy hard..
1136,2017-10-17T12:15:20.000320,Johana,"yea, when i was instantly talking to the database and being productive i was sold. i gotta admit though it changes your thinking. when you come strictly from the db world you think about data as sets. You don’t think about working at the individual row level and iterating. Then when you get into programming it flips your mindset."
1136,2017-10-17T12:16:16.000007,Johana,the last thing you want is a cursor b/c it’s slow.
1136,2017-10-17T12:23:03.000683,Mallie,"That may not change your self-assessment of SQL skillz, nor should it, but chances are they will ask a handful of things that are easily covered by those sorts of resources"
1137,2017-10-17T12:07:47.000754,Suellen,dbapi? :stuck_out_tongue:
1137,2017-10-17T12:22:24.000243,Mallie,<@Kenny> You could also review some SQL interview questions and do some SQL problems on Hacker Rank or something. It's unlikely anything will get much deeper than what you could get out of playing around with that stuff for a bit
1138,2017-10-17T13:55:07.000147,Meghan,I've yet to use SQL Alchemy. Is an ORM really that much better than just writing SQL?
1138,2017-10-17T13:55:38.000094,Meg,"for about 80-90% of the stuff you do, yeah"
1138,2017-10-17T13:55:47.000559,Meg,but there are cases where raw sql is better
1138,2017-10-17T13:56:15.000460,Meg,"especially with optimized queries and such.  in addition, some ORMs can create lots of duplicate queries during the compilation process"
1138,2017-10-17T13:57:54.000282,Meghan,What is the advantage of it?
1138,2017-10-17T13:58:07.000255,Meg,ease of use
1138,2017-10-17T13:58:41.000073,Meg,makes quite a few things easier when executing queries
1138,2017-10-17T13:59:32.000556,Meghan,Interesting. May have to give it a try some time. Since we've switched to DreamFactory I'm usually just calling a stored procedure through a rest api.
1138,2017-10-17T14:00:02.000249,Meg,then you gotta write that query…
1138,2017-10-17T14:00:22.000089,Meghan,Yes. Most of them are easy though.
1138,2017-10-17T14:00:44.000651,Meg,"I mean, I wouldn’t want to write this query out by hand"
1138,2017-10-17T14:00:56.000431,Meghan,"Most of our data isn't all that relational. Lots of small projects with hundreds of thousands of records, but relatively flat."
1138,2017-10-17T14:01:24.000503,Meghan,"Haha, nah, no interest in writing that."
1138,2017-10-17T14:01:57.000432,Meg,"with that, its basically fifteen lines in Django ORM,"
1138,2017-10-17T14:02:06.000284,Winnifred,how many records is that ?
1138,2017-10-17T14:02:34.000014,Meg,me or <@Meghan>?
1138,2017-10-17T14:03:05.000590,Winnifred,"Sorry, you, should have specified :slightly_smiling_face:"
1138,2017-10-17T14:03:26.000083,Meg,"hmm, small database but with plenty of tables"
1138,2017-10-17T14:03:38.000471,Meg,"so, for this particular query, it aggregates over about 8k rows"
1138,2017-10-17T14:04:35.000083,Winnifred,"ah, gotcha"
1138,2017-10-17T14:04:59.000296,Meg,so I basically made a model manager in django
1138,2017-10-17T14:05:08.000207,Meg,created a metrics method to aggregate
1138,2017-10-17T14:05:28.000464,Meg,and I pass in extra fields in a dict with the evaluation to occur
1138,2017-10-17T14:07:03.000094,Patty,i’d like to write that just to reminisce on my T-SQL and PL/SQL days
1138,2017-10-17T14:07:15.000234,Meg,masochist :smile:
1138,2017-10-17T14:09:01.000662,Meghan,Should the ORM create the schema or is it better to adapt to an existing one?
1138,2017-10-17T14:09:23.000466,Meg,you can do both
1138,2017-10-17T14:09:31.000616,Meg,django will let you create models from an existing schema
1138,2017-10-17T14:09:40.000064,Meg,or you can create it from your model definition
1138,2017-10-17T14:13:57.000348,Winnifred,"<@Meg>, do you cache a lot of your queries?"
1138,2017-10-17T14:15:16.000001,Meg,yes
1138,2017-10-17T14:15:19.000714,Meg,and profile
1138,2017-10-17T14:15:25.000813,Meg,`django-silk` really comes in handy
1138,2017-10-17T14:16:10.000074,Meg,but caching is a little tricky because you basically have to try to strike a happy medium between cache lifetime and new data
1138,2017-10-17T14:18:49.000505,Winnifred,"ah, nice, I need to figure out efficient caching"
1138,2017-10-17T14:20:12.000092,Meg,what are you using?
1138,2017-10-17T14:21:21.000344,Winnifred,"no current projects right now, but I was running into problems with ORMs and large queries out of a redshift  instance"
1138,2017-10-17T14:21:56.000368,Winnifred,but I think this is because I hadn’t transformed the data enough to get the data to a point where it requires a simple query
1138,2017-10-17T14:24:30.000239,Meg,hahaha
1138,2017-10-17T14:24:35.000087,Meg,how can you ask for more?
1138,2017-10-17T14:26:28.000345,Mallie,would definitely give it a :thumbsup:
1138,2017-10-17T14:28:18.000289,Frieda,"sure, you just have to consume it first"
1138,2017-10-17T14:29:23.000615,Amie,In what manner <@Frieda>
1138,2017-10-17T14:30:21.000456,Frieda,"if it really is a generator object, you should be able to consume it to a list or a string or whatever (list is probably safest) and then print that"
1138,2017-10-17T14:30:49.000099,Meghan,Assuming of course it doesn't generate infinitely. I think list(generator) would be bad if that were the case. :wink:
1138,2017-10-17T14:30:56.000271,Amie,"Yeah I tried to consume to list, and that did not work. Perhaps not truly a generator object?"
1138,2017-10-17T14:31:27.000281,Frieda,look it up in the source and see what's actually being returned? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1138,2017-10-17T14:32:49.000039,Winnifred,"yeah, I fired that off a bit prematurely, sorry"

1142,2017-10-17T19:20:35.000219,Cordie,"This is my file structure
```

│       ├── psycopg2/
│       └── psycopg2-2.7.3.1.dist-info/
└── team_configs
    └── team.py
```

and in my team.py, I have `import psycopg2` which doesn't work since the import path is wrong. But I don't know how to read from parents folder from team.py. I want to do something like `import ../packages/psycopg2`. Any suggestions?"
1142,2017-10-17T19:23:47.000270,Frieda,is there a reason you're manually installing/finding packages?
1142,2017-10-17T19:26:28.000017,Cordie,<@Frieda> serverless.yml packages it this way.. I figured python would be easier to correct it
1142,2017-10-17T19:26:51.000197,Frieda,ok
1142,2017-10-17T19:26:53.000092,Cordie,I really love python except for import thingy
1142,2017-10-17T19:27:05.000142,Cordie,never ever understand why it'ss so difficult
1142,2017-10-17T19:27:13.000060,Frieda,it's not?
1142,2017-10-17T19:27:23.000034,Frieda,python's packaging works. `serverless.yml` is the one doing it weird
1142,2017-10-17T19:27:27.000234,Cordie,"wait, so my problem is easily solvable?"
1142,2017-10-17T19:28:07.000079,Frieda,"i mean, sure, maybe? you could add each directory in `packages` to the `PYTHONPATH`?"
1142,2017-10-17T19:28:28.000176,Cordie,ok that will be difficult. These files are going to run on AWS ec2
1142,2017-10-17T19:28:52.000326,Frieda,there's a whole `os` module that can find the directories without you knowing exactly where they are. or even what exists.
1142,2017-10-17T19:29:02.000025,Marcie,the packages directory for serverless is only supposed to be for deployment
1142,2017-10-17T19:29:02.000341,Cordie,oo!
1142,2017-10-17T19:29:15.000268,Marcie,you're supposed to still use a virtualenv for local development
1142,2017-10-17T19:29:22.000375,Marcie,and a requirements.txt to keep them aligned
1142,2017-10-17T19:29:32.000081,Frieda,or maybe `pipenv`
1142,2017-10-17T19:31:04.000222,Cordie,ok I am not going to explain why ... exactly this happened. But the gist is that pip installed libraries don't compile well under amazon linux. So I had to docker in and do some bs to download compilable libraries. but... anyway the end result is the folder structure above. I don't want to move them under team_configs folder since than I will have to make copy of psycopg2 for every other python files too. This is just tip of the iceburg.
1142,2017-10-17T19:32:10.000150,Cordie,today has been long :disappointed:
1142,2017-10-17T19:33:12.000132,Frieda,did you try something like this? <https://serverless.com/blog/serverless-python-packaging/>
1142,2017-10-17T19:35:41.000300,Cordie,I saw it and tried to avoid plugin if there was easy way out. I guess i will have to use it.
1142,2017-10-17T19:36:11.000204,Frieda,it feels like you're making this harder on yourself than you need to
1142,2017-10-17T19:36:20.000158,Cordie,for not using plugin?
1142,2017-10-17T19:37:06.000083,Frieda,just this whole combination of things
1142,2017-10-17T19:37:21.000254,Frieda,"but, sorta, yeah. i mean, if a problem is solved..."
1142,2017-10-17T19:37:53.000312,Cordie,dude I know
1142,2017-10-17T19:38:01.000048,Cordie,I think I'm just a bit slow
1142,2017-10-17T19:38:12.000081,Cordie,thanks for helping out
1142,2017-10-17T19:38:15.000344,Frieda,haha i wouldn't say you're slow at all
1142,2017-10-17T19:38:21.000301,Frieda,purity only goes so far
1142,2017-10-17T19:38:29.000243,Cordie,yeah
1142,2017-10-17T19:40:33.000083,Frieda,"anyway, good luck with it. i'd love to hear how it turns out. i've been meaning to try out serverless stuff but haven't had a reason yet"
1142,2017-10-17T19:46:27.000088,Cordie,Thanks. I've decided to just flatten out my directory structure since each lambda functions are modular anyway. That way all lambdas can share utils/ and packages/ etc.
1142,2017-10-17T19:46:32.000203,Cordie,serverless is great dude

1145,2017-10-18T10:17:50.000259,Willena,good to remember though that stemming will probably not help for determining synonyms since a synonym often doesn't look anything like the other word or phrase

1147,2017-10-18T11:42:19.000137,Johana,the first time i went into the #pocoo channel on irc i saw armin ronacher helping a guy. The guy was trying to run python scripts like php where the url is like `<http://mywebsite.com/file.py>` and trying to work with flask. I couldn’t believe how amazingly patient armin was. Armin kept repeating over and over for them to do the tutorial and they didn’t seem to want to try to understand. i eventually ended up with a headache b/c the guy was being so difficult and didn’t want to try any suggestions. I was impressed with how patient he was and it left an impression on me since i was just getting into Flask and saw the author himself helping someone who was being difficult and never losing their cool.
1147,2017-10-18T11:45:11.000548,Johana,"and after that day i saw armin like one other time, lol."
1147,2017-10-18T11:45:23.000145,Vita,"0_o really cool of the author to do that, suprising the guy wouldnt listen to the AUTHOR of the framework"
1147,2017-10-18T11:46:00.000453,Johana,"yea, it was … difficult. i wanted to go nuts and yell, “PYTHON IS NOT PHP!!!!”"
1147,2017-10-18T11:46:56.000153,Vita,Lol considering watching your patience with all of us in the <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> channel that makes me kinda cringe at the thought of hwo bad it was
1147,2017-10-18T11:47:34.000085,Johana,"haha, like i said. he left an impression on me and now i try to take the patient approach."
1147,2017-10-18T11:48:06.000210,Vita,Nice!
1147,2017-10-18T11:48:09.000311,Johana,i guess i was really amazed that he would even take the time to help.
1147,2017-10-18T11:49:33.000430,Vita,It does say a lot about the guy willing to help a total beginner on it
1147,2017-10-18T11:54:18.000568,Johana,"he’s a pretty interesting guy. i tried to ask him a lot of questions about his decisions in flask whenever i did get a chance to see him. He always gave these very simple yet cryptic replies. One time I asked kinda a silly question b/c i was a newb but impressed with the flexibility of Flask. I asked him what I could read, learn, or do to write applications that were extensible and flexible. He wrote back, “Don’t write software that isn’t flexible.” At the time I was confused and like “oh … ok”… but now I know what he meant and in the end it was a pretty good answer."
1147,2017-10-18T11:54:58.000538,Vita,Lol nice :joy:
1147,2017-10-18T11:55:01.000553,Vada,"I feel like that should be followed with a ""But don't write software that is too flexible"""

1147,2017-10-18T11:55:17.000882,Johana,which can be a shortcoming for flask sometimes
1147,2017-10-18T11:55:49.000491,Johana,he later wrote me back saying he sometimes has trouble articulating his thoughts (i was very surprised by that b/c his writing is good) and that I should ensure that my stuff has a lot of “hooks”.
1147,2017-10-18T11:55:56.000607,Johana,i spent a lot of time looking up what hooks were lol.
1147,2017-10-18T11:58:13.000034,Sirena,"""Don't write software that isn't flexible"" is itself a pretty flexible answer."
1147,2017-10-18T11:58:32.000015,Vada,I like the hooks line though
1147,2017-10-18T11:58:34.000267,Johana,i may have used the word extensible and not flexible but whatevs
1147,2017-10-18T11:58:57.000145,Johana,it was a number of years ago.
1147,2017-10-18T11:59:14.000033,Vada,I don't often think of my code in terms of events but it's probably worth putting myself in that mindset more
1147,2017-10-18T11:59:23.000841,Sirena,they're interchangeable when you're not being terribly specific about your meaning
1147,2017-10-18T12:09:42.000079,Beula,"Oh boy this is funky, I need to coerce csv values to match the type in the database (to abstract away some ETL stuff), is there a better way than:

```
    def same_data(self, csv_row: Dict[str, str],
                  db_record: namedtuple) -&gt; bool:
        for csv_name, col_name in self.csv_to_col.items():
            col_val = db_record._asdict()[col_name]
            csv_val = type(col_val)(csv_row[csv_name])  # coerce
            if col_val != csv_val:
                return False
        return True
```

where `col_name` is the database column name, `csv_name` is the csv column name, `db_record` is a named tuple from psycopg2, and `csv_row` is a dict from a csv.DictReader row"
1148,2017-10-18T12:16:08.000069,Winnifred,TIL: `type( )( )` pattern
1148,2017-10-18T12:16:32.000557,Beula,"I am not sure I recommend it yet, it's really the only reliable way I could think of doing the coercion to do the comparisons"
1148,2017-10-18T12:19:37.000779,Ronni,"had a need to coerce values from an Excel import, into Django models, and I used a mapping of the columns to the type, not as concise as your example but explicit"
1148,2017-10-18T12:20:55.000284,Beula,"I thought about that as an option too - but I like the idea of the database being the ""source of truth"" for this project since it's just a data pipeline (I want it to be low maintenance). But that is a good option too"
1148,2017-10-18T12:22:01.000219,Winnifred,do table columns and csv headers have same name or are they similar?
1148,2017-10-18T12:22:25.000222,Beula,"Not always, but I just expanded it to default to the same if no `csv_to_col` is set on the class"
1148,2017-10-18T12:22:41.000193,Beula,Because that is serving as a mapping of csv row to the db row
1148,2017-10-18T12:27:01.000747,Winnifred,"yeah, I actually like this. I just noticed you’re using a namedtuple."
1148,2017-10-18T12:27:17.000237,Beula,Yep! Psycopg2 has a NamedTupleCursor
1148,2017-10-18T12:27:41.000198,Beula,also a dictcursor
1148,2017-10-18T12:28:24.000349,Ronni,it made a lot more sense in my case b/c with Django as the intermediary the model class can still be the source of truth - I later created a module that uses the ModelForm so it can validate and coerce as necessary as well
1148,2017-10-18T12:28:43.000040,Beula,"Yeah, that totally makes sense!"
1148,2017-10-18T12:29:08.000453,Winnifred,"yeah, the mapping aspect is covered here and I think that’s the important part —  ~I wonder what the internals of the coercion are~"
1148,2017-10-18T12:29:50.000003,Beula,"If it's a complex class it probably wont work, but it's all database primitives (Decimal, float, int, string) pretty much"
1148,2017-10-18T12:30:03.000713,Ronni,"I don't see anything wrong with using `type` like you have here - you need to read that line a bit carefully to see what's going on, but it strikes me as a reasonable strategy"
1148,2017-10-18T12:30:15.000007,Beula,And they all have constructors like `int('1')` or `str('foobar')`
1148,2017-10-18T12:30:42.000240,Beula,"Thanks for the feedback on it, I will add a little comment to make sure it's clear when I come back in two weeks and :facepalm: about some bad assumption I made :joy:"

1150,2017-10-19T05:07:14.000359,Arlean,"hello, people!
i am starting to use `pytest` for a project and trying to get my head around the best and correct design patterns of using fixtures.
specifically, i have a couple of questions:
1. if i want to have a fixture that can serve both a single test at function scope and a bunch of tests in a class/module scope (determined by command line option at runtime) - shall i create 2 fixtures that provide basically the same dependency (a Class instance, that prepares and exposes a resource I'm testing) but each decorated with different scope? what is the best way to tackle this?
2. is it common practice to use the request.config as a place to store shared data that can be accessed by different fixtures? what is the better way?

thanks for any help in advance! :slightly_smiling_face:
p.s.
are you familiar with any open source projects that leverage pytest extensively - for more than just unit tests, with complex fixtures that uses other fixtures, etc... so one could learn from?"
1150,2017-10-19T05:15:03.000176,Collette,"<@Arlean> 1. Why? Do you have an example?
2. I'd use a shared session-scoped fixture instead"
1151,2017-10-19T06:22:47.000181,Ronald,"I am using the open() function to append a file however, this function creates a new file if it does not exist. How do I disable this part. I only want to append existing files and not create new ones if they aren't available. Any help would be much appreciated"
1151,2017-10-19T06:25:17.000350,Meg,check if a file exists first
1151,2017-10-19T06:25:20.000140,Meg,then open it
1151,2017-10-19T06:25:41.000148,Scot,use `os.path.isfile()`
1151,2017-10-19T06:26:01.000250,Scot,for checking existence
1151,2017-10-19T06:26:33.000167,Meg,"or `os.path.exists()`  

they basically do the same thing here"
1151,2017-10-19T06:27:37.000147,Scot,When would i use `exist` over `isfile` ?
1151,2017-10-19T06:29:04.000155,Scot,Works for directories as well I see
1151,2017-10-19T06:30:04.000071,Meg,correct
1151,2017-10-19T06:30:12.000217,Meg,"so, its a bit of duplicate functionality"
1151,2017-10-19T06:30:49.000300,Meg,"`isfile` would work for a path to a file, `isdir` is for a path to a directory"
1151,2017-10-19T06:31:31.000367,Meg,"`exists` covers both, with some potential issues of permissions"
1151,2017-10-19T06:31:35.000386,Collette,"I'd rather go with ```
try:
    with open(filename, 'r+') as f:

1151,2017-10-19T06:31:53.000374,Collette,`os.path.exists` and `os.path.isfile` are both error-prone to race conditions
1151,2017-10-19T06:32:57.000001,Scot,"Seems a bit of an overkill for most of my purposes, but good to know..."

is only 2 lines shorter. The correct version doesn't seem to be a huge overkill to me :slightly_smiling_face:"
1151,2017-10-19T06:36:47.000216,Scot,Enlighten a dummy: Any penalty to speed using `seek`? My files are in the 10-100Gb sizes from time to time
1151,2017-10-19T06:40:51.000314,Gabriele,"You need to be at the end of the file if you want to append, so it's doing nothing that wouldn't already be done"
1151,2017-10-19T06:42:24.000251,Collette,"<@Scot> CPython calls `lseek` with `whence=SEEK_END`

1151,2017-10-19T06:42:35.000162,Scot,I suspect I may have misunderstood the intent of the `seek` way of doing it from the get-go. Understood it as a general better replacement to using `os.path.isfile`
1151,2017-10-19T06:45:30.000284,Collette,"No, `seek` is a way to move the current file pointer over the file as you wish"
1151,2017-10-19T08:10:01.000172,Arlean,"<@Collette> - thanks for suggestions. have some followup questions though:
1. example? I want a fixture that sets up some Server and then test it - either by providing a fresh Server instance to every test (function scope) or by reusing the same Server for a bunch of tests (class scope) - the Server setting up fixture is the same - the usage is different. 
my idea was to have:
```
@pytest.fixture(scope='function')
def server_for_single_test():
   return Server()

@pytest.fixture(scope='class')
def server_for_tests_in_class():
    return Server()
```
but this feels rather redundant, no?

2. regarding the pytest shared session fixture suggestion...
wouldn't this mean i'd need to have every fixture define it in it's args?
```
def fixture_a(request, shared_state, ...):
    pass
```
no way to avoid this? feels like autouse wouldn't fit here as i need access to the shared_state instance somehow"
1151,2017-10-19T08:15:24.000157,Collette,"<@Arlean> 
1. Yeah, I got what you meant. But _why_ do you need this? What problem you're trying to solve with that?
2. Yes. Just like you'll need `request` fixture requested in every single test"
1151,2017-10-19T08:22:13.000282,Arlean,"<@Collette> 
it is not really a problem, more a constraint.
* the Server I'm testing takes a while to bring up and configure, so I would like to minimize this time during tests and have multiple tests run against same Server
* on the other hand, some tests are more destructive than others and might affect other tests if they run against the same Server - so I would like to have them run separately
* in addition, would like to have the option to decide on which way to run from command line flag and not for example forcing all tests be in classes even if they are classes of single test

hope this makes sense"
1151,2017-10-19T08:24:30.000175,Arlean,"oh, and for 2. there is a workaround:
```
import pytest
...
def some_test_or_fixture(request):  
    assert pytest.config == request.config
```
so i do not *have* to pass request just for some shared data"
1151,2017-10-19T08:26:22.000115,Collette,"Alright. I'd put these two kinds of tests into separate folders, with different fixtures, and run them like `pytest tests/shared` and `pytest tests/destructive`"
1151,2017-10-19T08:27:24.000420,Collette,"To me a cli switch is not enough when doing destructive things. I think you have to be explicit about what you're doing, and it's better to minimize the possibility of running a wrong suite"
1151,2017-10-19T08:30:01.000241,Collette,"Anyway, I'd go with two different fixtures"
1151,2017-10-19T08:31:27.000002,Arlean,"ok, I'm glad I was in the same basic direction with defining different fixtures for this

1153,2017-10-19T10:03:24.000130,Winnie,you can use a heapq

1153,2017-10-19T10:06:08.000272,Meg,"<@Winnie>’s would work if you needed some sort of rolling, always-available stack"

1153,2017-10-19T10:16:33.000739,Winnie,the current project I'm working on uses an Enum to store a set of default colours
1153,2017-10-19T10:16:54.000221,Winnie,however this was a bad design decision because colours can also be customised
1153,2017-10-19T10:17:58.000410,Winnie,and so now I've run into that issue where a Colour Enum was tried to be created but couldn't because it wasn't pre-defined
1153,2017-10-19T10:18:28.000558,Winnie,is ther esome way to define a custom element in an enum to hold any colour?
1153,2017-10-19T10:20:14.000324,Winnie,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; from enum import Enum

&gt;&gt;&gt; Color(BLACK)
Color.CUSTOM"
1153,2017-10-19T10:21:07.000484,Antionette,where CUSTOM can be dynamically changed? or just that any non-existant key maps to a pre-existing CUSTOM?
1153,2017-10-19T10:21:49.000428,Antionette,if the first I don't think that's possible with Enum
1153,2017-10-19T10:22:06.000696,Winnie,wait let me edit that

1153,2017-10-19T10:28:26.000820,Meghan,So the code using this then goes something like `if Color.RED: color_value = '#ff0000'`
1153,2017-10-19T10:30:09.000228,Winnie,"more correclty the code is
```

1153,2017-10-19T10:46:19.000284,Winnie,Someone's told me that Sum Types are what should be used for this but They're not really a thing in python
1153,2017-10-19T10:47:01.000090,Collette,<@Winnie> I'd vote for refactoring
1153,2017-10-19T10:47:53.000524,Collette,You can't preserve backwards compatibility forever using these kinds of hacks
1153,2017-10-19T10:48:13.000040,Collette,"And since you don't have much code to change yet, it's better to break everything now than later"
1153,2017-10-19T10:49:43.000177,Winnie,"<@Collette> yeah I'd agree
I just wanted to see if there was anything possible to oncsider first"
1153,2017-10-19T10:50:40.000464,Collette,"Even if that is technically possible, I don't see how that would fit the mental model of enums"
1153,2017-10-19T10:51:42.000884,Winnie,So why would a dictionary make more sense?
1153,2017-10-19T10:51:54.000406,Meghan,Did you look at the SO post I shared? It can be done with the aenum library.
1153,2017-10-19T10:52:08.000110,Meghan,Because you can add to a dictionary as you go and can address it by key.
1153,2017-10-19T10:53:10.000105,Winnie,"but I don't really need to address it by key
It's just a unified structure to store a colour
which could just be a string instead."
1153,2017-10-19T10:55:08.000287,Winnie,"<@Meghan> I did look at the link, What wouldn't make sense is what the name should be when you add a new one in"
1153,2017-10-19T10:56:29.000372,Scot,"Should a custom given, non-existent color code result in it being stored under a unique ID for further use alongside other new custom colors?"
1153,2017-10-19T10:56:47.000046,Collette,<@Winnie> it sounds like you need a mapping between color names and some sort of values. A dictionary can be used to implement such mapping very easy
1153,2017-10-19T10:57:43.000792,Sirena,"I came to Python from C/C++ so I tend to shy away from assigning real meaning to the value of an enum. Whether or not that is idiomatic in python I'm not sure, but I feel like it's a behavior that's unlikely to backfire on me. Dictionaries are meant to map from one piece of info to another which sounds more appropriate for your situation. Enums work best when they are compared with each other but not really used as substitute numbers or substitute strings. That's not to say it's the only way to use them, but it seems the most resilient way"
1153,2017-10-19T10:58:25.000766,Meghan,"Yeah, once the value matters it should be a dict."
1153,2017-10-19T10:59:00.000445,Winnie,"well the thing is that there's only ever one reference to a colour name in the code
I think an enum was used just because they thought an enum would suit the job"
1153,2017-10-19T10:59:52.000137,Sirena,"and it did at the time, but now you want to extend it and it doesn't fit as well as it used to"
1153,2017-10-19T11:00:11.000812,Winnie,actually
1153,2017-10-19T11:00:35.000848,Sirena,"and you can still make it work if you really want, but it will involve a lot of branching depending on whether your enum is custom or not"
1153,2017-10-19T11:00:43.000323,Winnie,an enum kinda fits because the user should only be able to provide the given values in the enum
1153,2017-10-19T11:03:00.000255,Scot,why not reverse the key:value to value:key and run a dict lookup?
1153,2017-10-19T11:03:00.000554,Collette,<@Winnie> don't you think that contradicts to what you've said earlier?
1153,2017-10-19T11:03:24.000443,Winnie,disclaimer: it's 2am here
1153,2017-10-19T11:03:31.000124,Sirena,"I'm confused, if the user only gets to use the provided values, why do you need custom at all?"
1153,2017-10-19T11:06:17.001052,Winnie,"okay I think it might be easier to give the longer story
so I'm working on the fbchat module, which interfaces with messenger
messenger would allow you to configure colours given a set ammount
but there was a point where you could just make a get request for any colour
so now I have a facebook chat with a black chat bubble
now fbchat attempts to read in the colour to its pre-defined enum
but now, messenger has made it such that you can no longer make a get request with any colour"
1153,2017-10-19T11:07:12.000120,Winnie,"so the module needs to be able to accept any colour from a chat
but we need to tell users that only these colours in this enum can be actually sent"
1153,2017-10-19T11:08:08.000675,Winnie,"so what I'm thinking is to re-factor such that on return of a colour, a string is given instead of a ThreadColor object, but on sending, a user must give a ThreadColor object"
1153,2017-10-19T11:08:11.000026,Sirena,"so it gets the color options from messenger, and offers just those to the user?"

1153,2017-10-19T11:10:22.000461,Sirena,would it work to build a dict from the messenger data and then just catch a KeyError if the user gives something not in the dict?

1153,2017-10-19T11:12:59.000686,Collette,This project really likes enums :slightly_smiling_face:
1153,2017-10-19T11:13:09.000396,Winnie,yeah...
1153,2017-10-19T11:13:23.000528,Winnie,<@Sirena> I think it makes more sense to give the user a datastructure that they have to use as opposed to let them send whatever they want but just fail them when they do it wrong
1153,2017-10-19T11:14:04.000447,Antionette,Might be able to build off of something like this:
1153,2017-10-19T11:15:34.000031,Antionette,if you can somehow find way to get val be a color instead of just the int
1153,2017-10-19T11:16:07.000074,Winnie,<@Antionette> you'd just pass the string instead
1153,2017-10-19T11:16:22.000219,Antionette,well I meant an instance of `Color`
1153,2017-10-19T11:16:41.000726,Antionette,right now the newly added values are different from the values created when the Enum is instantiated
1153,2017-10-19T11:16:59.000038,Winnie,howso
1153,2017-10-19T11:17:20.000808,Antionette,ie in the example that gets printed Color(2) is Color.RED but Color(3) is Custom3 rather than Color.Custom3
1153,2017-10-19T11:17:38.000623,Antionette,it points to just the name rather than a `Color` with the correct name
1153,2017-10-19T11:18:15.000151,Winnie,right
1153,2017-10-19T11:18:42.000783,Winnie,it's probably better to use extend_enum in that case
1153,2017-10-19T11:19:28.000875,Antionette,extend_enum?
1153,2017-10-19T11:21:20.000581,Meghan,"Ah, the class method was what I was getting wrong earlier. Thanks for that."

1153,2017-10-19T11:26:46.000264,Antionette,"ah sure, that looks like its a much more fleshed out version"
1153,2017-10-19T11:37:18.000470,Winnie,<@Sirena> were you typing something?
1153,2017-10-19T11:38:31.000556,Antionette,Here's how the enum class adds the initial members so you might be able to wrap that into the add method I posted above if the library doesn't work out for some reason

1153,2017-10-19T11:43:30.000035,Meghan,"You were using Custom#, which avoids the duplicates though."
1153,2017-10-19T11:44:02.000587,Meghan,"Would need to check if the name already exists first. But, otherwise I think that should do what Evan is requesting."
1153,2017-10-19T11:44:29.000286,Antionette,Yeah I wasn't sure if a name was actually being supplied or just the color code
1153,2017-10-19T11:46:35.000446,Sirena,"Essentially, I would say that an enum that is mutable isn't terribly enum-like. I get that you would prefer backward compatibility, but when you extend an enum, you sortof break the agreement you have with the code that an enum is always one set of options"
1153,2017-10-19T11:46:40.000291,Meghan,"```
class ExtendableEnum(Enum):
    @classmethod
    def add(cls, name, val=None):
        if name not in cls.__members__:
            if not val:

This should work, other than value can't be changed once an item is created. Which I think is what you would want."
1153,2017-10-19T11:47:09.000406,Winnie,<@Sirena> I agree
1153,2017-10-19T11:48:58.000379,Antionette,And it does look like some of the other models are based on other datatypes so if the refactoring isn't too bad I don't think the maintainers should mind
1153,2017-10-19T11:49:59.000539,Winnie,My biggest peeve with this module is camelcase
1153,2017-10-19T11:50:18.000301,Winnie,but yeah this module needs a complete style do-over
1153,2017-10-19T11:51:28.000231,Sirena,"yeah, some habits never die. Just gotta hold your nose if you can't talk the maintainer into changing it though"

1154,2017-10-19T09:22:47.000445,Christin,Is there any function in Sklearn that plots the learning curve of a model in terms of Ein-sample and Evalidation? 
1154,2017-10-19T09:23:05.000239,Christin,The default one uses score or accuracy i think

1159,2017-10-19T12:50:41.000051,Burma,Thanks <@Suellen> I'll give it a try
1159,2017-10-19T12:51:07.000320,Burma,seems like a steep learning curve for a newbie
1159,2017-10-19T12:51:36.000256,Suellen,"I mean, most of the stuff that you would normally use is on the first 10-20 pages"
1159,2017-10-19T12:57:17.000128,Burma,Yea seems little intimidating I'll give it a try basically I would want to run series of queries against an API . which would return the status bunch of nodes
1159,2017-10-19T12:58:08.000759,Burma,which would send the data to a database
1159,2017-10-19T12:59:07.000173,Burma,to display within a web browser
1159,2017-10-19T12:59:42.000127,Burma,is pytest overkill for such a task ?
1159,2017-10-19T13:01:52.000176,Winnifred,pytest will work great for that
1159,2017-10-19T13:20:21.000417,Sirena,"<@Kellye> what would you do with the .pyi files after you imported them? In most senses compilation time _is_ runtime, and .pyi is mostly just used for static analysis AFAIK"
1160,2017-10-19T13:21:56.000380,Sirena,"from PEP484:
&gt;&gt;&gt;While stub files are syntactically valid Python modules, they use the .pyi extension to make it possible to maintain stub files in the same directory as the corresponding real module. This also reinforces the notion that no runtime behavior should be expected of stub files."
1160,2017-10-19T13:27:04.000028,Kellye,"<@Sirena> 
that's true, that's why I need them, I want to use custom types from *.pyi files as contracts to function calls. For example defining custom model like
``` class MyModel:
   myProperty:int
```
then I could use it as parameter type in function. I assume mypy can detect that anonymous object follow contract of that virtual type from *.pyi file. like:
`def func(value:MyModel) ...`
then calling it like
`func({""myProperty"":1});`"
1160,2017-10-19T13:31:27.000066,Sirena,"I'm not an expert on this, but my understanding is that .pyi does not enforce a contract like that during run time"
1160,2017-10-19T13:33:44.000184,Sirena,"if you want to enforce it, you need
```def func(arg1):
  if not isinstance(arg1, classname):
    raise TypeError('received incorrect type in argument 1')```"
1160,2017-10-19T13:33:58.000479,Sirena,or something like that
1160,2017-10-19T13:36:05.000331,Sirena,"also, I'm not sure I follow your example, if you want the property of MyModel, just use it
```def func(value: int): . . .```
```func(MyModel.myProperty)```"
1160,2017-10-19T13:38:30.000075,Sirena,"and while it may not be easy or possible to redesign, typically if you find yourself doing typechecks in python, it's possible and recommended to design them out"
1160,2017-10-19T13:40:37.000015,Sirena,"none of this is hard and fast, just kind of a best practice when you aren't constrained by other factors"
1160,2017-10-19T13:40:56.000412,Kellye,"that's was just an example, basically you end up having 5-10+ props and nested objects. As I referred before, TypeScript makes it possible - you can define an 'interface' that will just specify data layout, but will be cut out after static type checks."
1160,2017-10-19T13:41:44.000477,Kellye,"I'm just trying to figure out whether it's possible in python, there's not much information on pyi files"
1160,2017-10-19T13:42:14.000405,Kellye,basically resources recommends you to have .pyi files in same structure as your source code
1160,2017-10-19T13:45:26.000624,Sirena,"I'm not terribly familiar with TypeScript, maybe someone else can field your question on that, but most python interfaces rely on behaviors/methods rather than on types"

1161,2017-10-19T16:21:50.000579,Beula,"Yeah, Mark, it is likely that `crunchy_json` does absolute imports"
1161,2017-10-19T16:22:16.000289,Beula,You may have to do the `pip install -e path/to/my/version` route
1161,2017-10-19T16:22:36.000255,Beula,"That installs it in ""editable"" mode (kind of like a symlink) and as you make changes in the lib it will reflect in the other environment you import it into"

1161,2017-10-19T16:40:33.000550,Antionette,Might be obvious but I think its worth pointing out that a key error will be thrown if bar is not something you are expecting
1162,2017-10-19T16:31:57.000178,Susann,"is there a more elegant way for conditionally assigning a variable based on the parameter passed in the function other than a couple `if` statements? 
```def foo(bar):
    if bar is 'this':
        ....
    if bar is 'that':
        ....``` It almost seems like the spot for case statements but that doesn't seem to be a better solution imo. The reason I'm using strings is because I am actually checking strings as the condition."
1162,2017-10-19T16:33:32.000528,Suellen,will this work for you?
1162,2017-10-19T16:35:27.000358,Susann,haven't seen that done before. that's perfect!

1162,2017-10-19T16:46:37.000100,Susann,that might actually be nice to wrap in a try/except because I am expecting specific strings and don't want it to continue on if I got something I'm not expecting

1162,2017-10-19T17:02:09.000472,Alonso,"the default is more 0 to 4 round down, 6 to 9 round up, a tie rounds to an even number"
1162,2017-10-19T17:03:18.000307,Antionette,that would be ROUND_HALF_EVEN

1171,2017-10-20T13:14:03.000624,Suellen,they have quite a lot of exercises ranging from very simple to quite complex

1171,2017-10-20T15:16:05.000081,Sirena,or possibly you have a line that doesn't match that format and ended up with a broken to_list object

1171,2017-10-20T15:23:00.000258,Sirena,is that the behavior you want? seems risky to just skip bad input unless you are pretty certain what is going on under the covers there
1171,2017-10-20T15:28:04.000314,Kristi,"<@Sirena> I did it because I know that the logs files that I need always have the same information, so if I find anything that do not match with that criteria I can skipped. The lines that contain less that 3 items were titles around the file."

I have an existing Class, and I'd like to port it to how sqlalchemy wants it
is there something that will automate that for me?"
1175,2017-10-21T11:44:41.000091,Collette,Okay?.. You want to generate a `sqlalchemy.orm` model based on some arbitrary class attributes?
1175,2017-10-21T11:45:04.000141,Winnie,those sound like the appropriate words
1175,2017-10-21T11:47:57.000016,Vita,"<http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/extensions/automap.html> You could use something like this to just take it from the db, otherwise it might be simpler to just create the class"

1175,2017-10-21T11:49:41.000066,Collette,Or that's a purely theoretical question?
1175,2017-10-21T11:51:48.000069,Collette,You'll basically need to re-implement <https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/blob/master/lib/sqlalchemy/ext/automap.py> to use a python class instead of a database
1175,2017-10-21T11:58:31.000112,Winnie,"<@Vita> the db doesn't exist yet
<@Collette> my use case is that my project consists of a scraper that stores its data as objects, but I want to persist those using a db
All the classes already exist, but from what I understand, if I want them to be compatible with sqlalchemy, I'd have to essentially re-write them"
1175,2017-10-21T11:59:59.000009,Collette,"Well, no. DB models can, but really shouldn't map directly to objects. How would you declare relationships without writing them manually, for instance?"
1175,2017-10-21T12:00:45.000025,Collette,"When you write DB models, you model your database. That's something orthogonal to how you store data in memory."
1175,2017-10-21T12:02:22.000034,Winnie,well It could be smart and see that classes as fields are just links to another table

1183,2017-10-23T08:14:28.000474,Jeanice,"Good morning Everyone, noob here. I am looking to insert a python variable into a M$SQL query.

Process would be something like:
Script prompts user for site number
Site number is defined as a variable
Script connects to M$SQL and uses the site number variable within the query
Script can then either create new python variables directly from SQL query results *or* return SQL query results to a list or tuple for reading/manipulation. 

I have looked into pymssql and pypyodbc and either I am too noob to catch onto something that's already in my face, or I don't see variables as a possible value to include in a SQL query. 

Any pointer or help are greatly appreciated! Thanks!"
1183,2017-10-23T08:17:23.000347,Cynthia,Looks like pymssql exposes the commonly-used Python DB-API: <http://pymssql.org/en/stable/pymssql_examples.html#basic-features-strict-db-api-compliance>
1183,2017-10-23T08:21:56.000154,Cynthia,It looks like pypyodbc is also DB-API compliant. I'd be surprised if there's any commonly-used Python database adapters that aren't.
1183,2017-10-23T08:24:56.000095,Ciera,sqlalchemy is often the go to
1183,2017-10-23T08:25:14.000170,Ciera,there is a full ORM but also the core that format your sql querries
1183,2017-10-23T08:40:42.000212,Cynthia,what's the output of `pip --version`?
1184,2017-10-23T08:36:57.000141,Chasity,Using pip install textract
1184,2017-10-23T08:41:36.000109,Chasity,pip 10.0.0.dev0 from /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-10.0.0.dev0-py2.7.egg (python 2.7)
1184,2017-10-23T08:42:19.000285,Meg,"so, lots of times when you install to system python, it won’t let you do it due to permissions"
1184,2017-10-23T08:42:50.000189,Meg,"when you ran `pip install textextract`, did you get any permision errors?"
1184,2017-10-23T08:43:04.000343,Chasity,Yes. I added sudo then and it installed properly.
1184,2017-10-23T08:43:14.000123,Collette,"Also, how did you manage to install a development version of `pip`?"
1184,2017-10-23T08:43:43.000094,Chasity,"hmm, I just ran this command - sudo easy_install pip"
1184,2017-10-23T08:43:48.000612,Collette,:facepalm:
1184,2017-10-23T08:43:52.000321,Chasity,And I got that version of pip.
1184,2017-10-23T08:44:04.000523,Collette,"Great news, your machine is now a mess."
1184,2017-10-23T08:44:38.000180,Meg,"basically, pip already was installed on your system"
1184,2017-10-23T08:44:52.000156,Meg,and there are a number of system-critical programs that are pinned to that python version
1184,2017-10-23T08:45:18.000207,Meg,"so when you overwrote that, you’ve possibly messed up a few things"
1184,2017-10-23T08:45:41.000125,Meg,"if you had just done `pip install -U pip`, that would have worked fine"
1184,2017-10-23T08:45:52.000383,Chasity,<@Collette> I was not aware of how important that command would be. <@Meg> How do I go about fixing it ?
1184,2017-10-23T08:46:02.000434,Cynthia,yeah… protip: _never_ run pip as root (i.e. with sudo)

1184,2017-10-23T08:46:36.000391,Chasity,<@Cynthia> Ok. I will definitely keep that in mind.
1184,2017-10-23T08:46:38.000247,Cynthia,the consequences of doing so tend to be irreversible
1184,2017-10-23T08:47:30.000355,Cynthia,"and also, don't run easy_install ever, especially to install pip"
1184,2017-10-23T08:47:48.000565,Cynthia,there exist ensurepip and get-pip.py for that scenario
1184,2017-10-23T08:48:08.000498,Chasity,Oh ok. I will do that going forward.
1184,2017-10-23T08:48:34.000589,Meg,"that said, there’s also the issue of how easy it is to do something like this"
1184,2017-10-23T08:48:48.000475,Winnie,"<@Chasity> don't worry, a lot of people learn this the hard way :stuck_out_tongue:"

1184,2017-10-23T08:50:59.000458,Chasity,"Ok, Can I remove pip ? Meaning the one I overrode ?"
1184,2017-10-23T08:51:20.000018,Ciera,the problem is that when installing something you are used to use `sudo` :confused:

1184,2017-10-23T08:51:57.000038,Chasity,Yup.
1184,2017-10-23T08:52:27.000422,Ciera,yeah the best way would be to reinstall. Otherwise you might have trouble in the future that will be really hard to debug
1184,2017-10-23T08:52:45.000253,Junita,yeah I’d restore from your last backup
1184,2017-10-23T08:53:14.000022,Ciera,and while restoring an article on virtualenv is needed :stuck_out_tongue:
1184,2017-10-23T08:53:36.000091,Chasity,"<@Ciera> I’ll probably restore to previous backup, <@Junita> Thank you."

1186,2017-10-23T14:28:25.000245,Lory,"haha, I too would like to get into that. It's some pretty thick stuff though"
1186,2017-10-23T14:28:32.000197,Jamaal,I know
1186,2017-10-23T14:28:47.000199,Jamaal,but with open source and a great community I think it is possible
1186,2017-10-23T14:28:53.000238,Lory,how much programming have you done?
1186,2017-10-23T14:29:00.000405,Lory,Nothing is impossible if you put the work in
1186,2017-10-23T14:29:01.000152,Jamaal,not much

1186,2017-10-23T14:30:03.000198,Johana,kinda on the topic of building an AI and being a beginner: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIofV14c0tc>
1186,2017-10-23T14:30:05.000018,Lory,you can find free pdf's of them online
1186,2017-10-23T14:30:28.000178,Jamaal,I was just about to say I know of a good place for free pdfs
1186,2017-10-23T14:30:29.000468,Johana,the above video is not only for data scientist. the presenter talks about hacking yourself into a community in general.
1186,2017-10-23T14:30:32.000191,Johana,it is very interesting.
1186,2017-10-23T14:30:47.000021,Jamaal,thank you <@Johana>

Have you seen <https://py.checkio.org/> ?   The first exercise is poorly lableled elementary and it is unfortunately the requirement to get everything else unlocked, but it is a great place to learn more functional programming.

1186,2017-10-23T14:33:50.000580,Johana,so are we touting coding challenges as a way to learn programming faster or something?
1186,2017-10-23T14:34:20.000391,Johana,i don’t think challenges have helped me learn a language as much as getting practice using concepts I already know and learning to use them in new ways.
1186,2017-10-23T14:34:34.000484,Jamaal,yes to supplement <@Johana>

1188,2017-10-23T15:05:27.000709,Derek,Thanks <@Meg>
1188,2017-10-23T15:06:09.000071,Derek,I had intended to be “verbose” when explaining my problem :slightly_smiling_face:
1188,2017-10-23T15:07:01.000478,Meg,:smile:
1189,2017-10-23T15:25:35.000062,Vita,How do people feel about functional testing in addition to unit testing? Think it is overkill or not needed until certain points in a project?
1189,2017-10-23T15:45:29.000379,Ronni,It's not overkill
1189,2017-10-23T15:50:41.000706,Seema,"there was a pycon panel about this with heavyweights and they will all in support, for slightly different reasons"
1189,2017-10-23T16:04:25.000114,Ronni,"I prefer _writing_ unit tests b/c they're faster and easier to write, but just like a child prefers cookies to roasted broccoli (mmm delicious!) it doesn't mean it's sufficient"
1190,2017-10-23T15:52:27.000603,Seema,"it was more about linting and humans than about functional testing though, very nuanced"
1190,2017-10-23T16:14:12.000103,Kellye,can anyone suggest popular IoC (inversion of control) package to use? PyPI provides too much to choose from <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&amp;term=dependency+injection&amp;submit=search>
1190,2017-10-23T16:23:48.000378,Lory,"Is there any real reason to using an ORM (like sqlalchamy) besides not having to write queries yourself? I personally have my own module for storing/executing/returning queries and at times it runs faster than the ORM, obviously because a human is better at constructing complex queries than a computer is (for now). So besides the obvious, are there other reasons you guys find yourselves using one?"
1190,2017-10-23T16:24:23.000459,Meg,how maintainable is your own module :slightly_smiling_face:
1190,2017-10-23T16:24:38.000075,Meg,scalable? works with schema changes without tinkering?
1190,2017-10-23T16:24:58.000350,Meg,"I mean, sure there are reasons to use raw sql over an ORM"
1190,2017-10-23T16:25:13.000568,Meg,but those should be limited to areas where the optimization is needed
1190,2017-10-23T16:25:27.000263,Meg,not as a first reaction
1190,2017-10-23T16:25:42.000244,Issac,"<@Lory> I generally try to avoid ORMs since I think they are often the wrong approach to the general problem of database abstraction, so you're not alone, but I'm sure you'll get _plenty_ of arguments for why you should use one"
1190,2017-10-23T16:26:11.000386,Meg,"<@Issac> how maintainable is that, though?"
1190,2017-10-23T16:26:51.000429,Lory,"for just myself and a few friends that use it, it's fairly easy. Just deifne your boiler plate queries and then call them through a few defined methods that give me all results or one result or whatever and have them preformatted to how I like my data structured"
1190,2017-10-23T16:26:59.000047,Lory,schema changes require manual intervention lol
1190,2017-10-23T16:28:03.000236,Issac,"<@Meg> you mean not using an ORM?  I would tend to argue that the types of abstractions that ORMs introduce is increasing the complexity of the code and introduces more maintenance overhead than not using one, although like anything else in development you can do it badly and incur a lot of pain"
1190,2017-10-23T16:28:25.000251,Lory,"sorry no, my small module"
1190,2017-10-23T16:28:45.000342,Antionette,"<@Meg> There's a middle ground between ORM and raw SQL (like <http://knexjs.org/> for node, not sure of a good example in python) that helps with maintainability while being a more simple abstraction"
1190,2017-10-23T16:28:58.000422,Meg,"django ORM works similar, I think"
1190,2017-10-23T16:29:13.000507,Meg,"as well as sqlalchemy, in which you can write raw sql and it’ll handle it for you"
1190,2017-10-23T16:29:19.000113,Lory,"My biggest gripe is that it feels awkward to use one in the code, and that's just because of a lack of familiarity with using ORM's, So I figured what does it _really_ matter if I just use my own"
1190,2017-10-23T16:29:31.000221,Meg,"and for your own projects, thats fine"
1190,2017-10-23T16:30:22.000283,Meg,"if you’re working on non-super critical performance in a team, then I would definitely make you justify the case of not using an ORM if I were interviewing you"
1190,2017-10-23T16:31:12.000284,Lory,"and it just that, I'm trying to get into free lance web application design so I'm slowly building my own modules for things I feel are bloated like ORM's, Login modules, etc..."
1190,2017-10-23T16:31:42.000545,Meg,sqlalchemy was started because the author was tired of hibernate’s bloatedness :slightly_smiling_face:
1190,2017-10-23T16:32:07.000122,Mallie,"Like most things you just need to be aware of the trade-offs, the once that have been mentioned incl. Imagine working on a large team or needing lots of people to be able to access and modify things in the database (like will happen many many times with a fairly complex dynamic website) and trusting all developers to get the SQL correct. That's a maintainability nightmare."
1190,2017-10-23T16:32:18.000382,Meg,bingo
1190,2017-10-23T16:32:28.000026,Meg,that there is my primary argument against
1190,2017-10-23T16:32:50.000242,Meg,especially if the actual performance difference is a few percents overall in load and query time
1190,2017-10-23T16:32:51.000232,Mallie,"And you may find that you only need to do one or two db calls, which is great, and you may find that as you maintain more and more projects all that ""custom"" SQL boilerplate wastes time."
1190,2017-10-23T16:33:59.000224,Meg,"furthermore, as a freelance web dev, <@Lory>, you have to consider the ‘when’ case, when another developer takes over your project"
1190,2017-10-23T16:34:18.000111,Meg,how easy is it for the other person/team to get up and running with your setup?
1190,2017-10-23T16:34:36.000361,Johana,i think you should decide what is most important to you when working with the ORM or the core.
1190,2017-10-23T16:34:46.000463,Johana,ORM is business objects and Core is more schema-centric.
1190,2017-10-23T16:35:10.000396,Johana,if you want to be down in the weeds and know your db schema you should use core. if you want to deal with things like business objects use the ORM.
1190,2017-10-23T16:35:22.000377,Issac,"I would agree with <@Meg> there, freelancing does come with the burden of not just doing the most technically right thing, but the most expected thing since a lot of what your client is paying for is something that can serve as a baseline for future devs to continue to modify and support the application"
1190,2017-10-23T16:35:27.000138,Johana,it depends on the level of abstraction you want. I’ve used both quite extensively.
1190,2017-10-23T16:36:43.000244,Johana,i try to avoid raw sql as much as possible.
1190,2017-10-23T16:37:03.000063,Meg,"speaking for myself, at my current place, I had to figure out what the hell the previous dev was thinking when he put together the query structure for a very important part of the API.  He just had python joining strings to construct the query, and execute with raw sql, using cursors, etc.

When I moved it over to using django ORM, the actual query time went down about 50 milliseconds per query… without indexes"
1190,2017-10-23T16:37:15.000033,Johana,much better to use a DSL like sqalchemy core.
1190,2017-10-23T16:37:37.000374,Issac,"I think ORMs are problematic because they unnecessarily couple several parts of the system that should be decoupled (datatype definitions, constraint solving, persistence, and transport of network attached data).  My personal experience is that in projects of any size they often end up causing more harm than good, and architecturally I dislike the types of applications that tend to have them central to the application"
1190,2017-10-23T16:38:08.000674,Johana,not all ORMs are created equal tho.
1190,2017-10-23T16:38:46.000103,Johana,sqlalchemy’s orm is significantly better than others i’ve used.
1190,2017-10-23T16:39:12.000349,Johana,for one it uses the unit of work pattern so you aren’t going to commit anything until it all works.
1190,2017-10-23T16:39:18.000597,Meg,"<@Issac> no argument there with your points about complexity and coupling.  But is that really significant, though?"
1190,2017-10-23T16:39:54.000377,Meg,"and personally, in my projects, I’ve had to drop to raw sql a handful of times when performance was required"
1190,2017-10-23T16:40:40.000239,Johana,<http://aosabook.org/en/sqlalchemy.html>
1190,2017-10-23T16:40:41.000246,Meg,"I really don’t like writing SQL, and only do it when the profiling shows there will be a distinct difference"
1190,2017-10-23T16:41:20.000217,Meg,"and that’s after optimizing the db structure, adding indexes, and doing everything to reduce the number of queries executed"
1190,2017-10-23T16:41:49.000082,Issac,"<@Meg> obviously I think it's significant, I don't expect everyone would agree with my personal weight of the tradeoffs though."
1190,2017-10-23T16:42:11.000305,Meg,"oh, certainly. Like I said, there’s valid arguments for and against"

1190,2017-10-23T16:44:07.000338,Meg,"nice talking with you, <@Issac> :slightly_smiling_face:"
1190,2017-10-23T16:44:25.000087,Issac,have a good meetup
1190,2017-10-23T16:44:57.000612,Meg,"thanks!  its put on by ESRI, and I know a few of the map/geo people going to be there"
1191,2017-10-23T17:33:12.000331,Micaela,"Hey all, in Python 2.7, using `unittest.assertRaisesRegexp`, how come it’s giving me false regex matching failures for my own exception classes, but working fine with something like `ValueError`?"
1191,2017-10-23T17:33:48.000164,Micaela,"in the fail message it says:
&gt; AssertionError: “Failed to find the needed file(s) matching 00000000-000000-xxxxxxxx” does not match “Failed to find the needed file(s) matching 00000000-000000-xxxxxxxx”"
1191,2017-10-23T17:34:09.000126,Micaela,When… those… are… identical… ?
1191,2017-10-23T17:34:48.000064,Micaela,"It’s not some weird text encoding comparison that’s failing, is it?"
1191,2017-10-23T17:41:22.000363,Micaela,"Actually nevermind, it’s something else going wrong somewhere, if I change the code to raise a ValueError instead I still get the same matching fail"
1191,2017-10-23T17:41:57.000170,Antionette,Can you post the code that is failing?
1191,2017-10-23T17:42:40.000466,Antionette,"If you have that exact string as the regex to match, you might need to escape the parens"
1192,2017-10-24T00:19:40.000003,Hermina,"Hi guys, i’m writing a module to read/write/edit files on target fpt server, I know python has supported ftp lib. But i just curious if I look for the folder files (in the server) and try doing nasty stuff with the file like normal file, and the ftp server can detect change, update it back to the ftp user? I dont mind write the module in the same server with fpt, but are there any drawback if I go down this path?"
1192,2017-10-24T00:25:30.000102,Bruno,What book do you guys recommend for a new python programmer that doesn't have programming experience. 
1192,2017-10-24T00:30:14.000057,Rosa,Think Python 2e.
1192,2017-10-24T00:30:27.000163,Rosa,A friend of mine was also new to programming and he found it really helpful.
1192,2017-10-24T00:38:32.000092,Seema,"I'd have to go with <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/> , partly because the book is free to read (the physical book still costs), partly because it's accessible and partly because it doesn't presume.  It lacks real apps and takes awhile to get going but it's free and if they put down the book for something better, no harm done."
1192,2017-10-24T00:46:14.000136,Bruno,The automate book still assumes you know basic programming concepts
1192,2017-10-24T00:51:00.000098,Seema,"the book does?  I thought it was based off the site which has things like
```You run the interactive shell by launching IDLE, which you installed with Python in the introduction. On Windows, open the Start menu, select All Programs ▸ Python 3.3, and then select IDLE (Python GUI). On OS X, select Applications ▸ MacPython 3.3 ▸ IDLE. On Ubuntu, open a new Terminal window and enter idle3.

A window with the &gt;&gt;&gt; prompt should appear; that’s the interactive shell. Enter 2 + 2 at the prompt to have Python do some simple math.


&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 2
4
The IDLE window should now show some text like this:


Python 3.3.2 (v3.3.2:d047928ae3f6, May 16 2013, 00:06:53) [MSC v.1600 64 bit
(AMD64)] on win32
Type ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license()"" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 2
4```"
1193,2017-10-24T02:44:32.000192,Ciera,<@Bruno> it doesn't the first part is all about basic concept :slightly_smiling_face:
1194,2017-10-24T04:12:00.000420,Louis,"`file(s)` is a regex that matches the string `files`, but not the string `file(s)`."
1194,2017-10-24T04:14:48.000063,Louis,"`assertRaisesRegexp` kinda sucks if you just want to match literal strings, sadly. To do that reliably, you need something like:
```
assertRaisesRegexp(exc, r'^{}$'.format(re.escape(expected_message)), …)
```"
1194,2017-10-24T04:15:58.000072,Louis,"Sometimes, it's easier to use the context manager instead:
```
with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
    do_something()
e = cm.exception
&lt;do assertions on e&gt;
```"
1194,2017-10-24T04:37:56.000261,Kayce,"<@Ines> I don't think that regex will help you since the structure of languages is more based off of context sensitive grammars. Regular expressions (finite automata) aren't powerful enough to represent the evaluate same set of strings as CSG's. (I could be wrong though, it's been years since I've done anything with computer science theory)."
1195,2017-10-24T04:29:41.000483,Kayce,"Hey all, Is there a way for me to be able to run a cleanup script when I use `deactivate` on my python envs? I set some environment variables in my `.env` that I would like to clear away when I'm done working on something."
1195,2017-10-24T04:32:05.000337,Ines,"I’m trying to write an application that will search for indentation made with 4 spaces or with tabs, and replace them with 2 spaces. In have found 2 options for doing this:  
1. with fileinput, but this seems to have some limitations and I don’t know if it can do what I want it to do
2. with re regular expressions
which one would you recommend?"
1195,2017-10-24T04:44:49.000333,Kayce,"<@Ines> Oh wait, what am I talking about. I totally missed your question (It's well past my bedtime). 

- get lines from your input file
- count how many spaces there are before the first character in the line"
1195,2017-10-24T04:45:53.000231,Ines,"would you please re-read my question :slightly_smiling_face: I know what I have to do, I just don’t know the easiest(/best) way to do it in python :slightly_smiling_face:"
1195,2017-10-24T04:46:11.000290,Kayce,"- divide that count by four, then multiply that by two.
- take the substring that's all text, prepend ((space_count / 4) * 2)"
1195,2017-10-24T04:47:36.000159,Junita,"I’d probably recommend simply using a regex, then you don’t have to count"
1195,2017-10-24T04:47:58.000249,Junita,"replacing four spaces or a tab with two spaces will work, regardless of how many multiples of four or tabs (or even a mix) there is"
1195,2017-10-24T04:52:00.000194,Ines,"<@Junita> thank you! I was thinking about fileinput as that will save me the trouble of opening the file, reading its content, fix the indentation, write back the content, close the file"
1195,2017-10-24T04:52:48.000087,Junita,"also note it might just be easier to do this with a tool like sed, unless you want to do use this as a learning exercise"
1195,2017-10-24T04:53:18.000154,Kayce,"I think it will confuse the regex. Assume the dashes are spaces, and the underscores are the replacement. Such that `----` gets evaluated to `_`.

What happens with `--------` (eight spaces)? Does it get evaluated like `_----` then `__`? Or does something weird happen like `-_---` where the regex wont capture the other 4 spaces."
1195,2017-10-24T04:53:54.000251,Ines,"but to be honest, I haven’t found how to search for patterns using line.replace… this is why I switched to re"
1195,2017-10-24T04:54:07.000330,Kayce,I say screw it and divide space count by two and the append the text.
1195,2017-10-24T04:54:30.000172,Ines,learning exercise and also I want a script that can be used independently
1195,2017-10-24T04:54:48.000068,Kayce,Forsure!
1195,2017-10-24T04:54:54.000234,Kayce,"One sec, I'm whipping something up"
1195,2017-10-24T04:55:34.000325,Suellen,&gt; I think it will confuse the regex.
1195,2017-10-24T04:55:46.000179,Suellen,I think regexes are not easily confused %)
1195,2017-10-24T04:56:03.000149,Suellen,They are a powerful tool with maths 'n stuff backing them up
1195,2017-10-24T04:56:19.000214,Junita,"<@Kayce> it’s pretty easy, you make a match (such as `^(\s{4}|\t)`) and then feed it into `re.sub`, which can handle multiple replaces: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub>"
1195,2017-10-24T04:58:33.000480,Suellen,exactly this
1195,2017-10-24T04:58:47.000225,Suellen,I even started to test it out :slightly_smiling_face:
1195,2017-10-24T04:59:11.000432,Junita,"there might need to be a tweak around the anchor to the beginning of the line, but yeah, that’s the general approach"
1195,2017-10-24T04:59:34.000160,Junita,"Especially if this is meant to be a learning exercise, might as well learn.  :slightly_smiling_face:"
1195,2017-10-24T04:59:57.000378,Junita,"If it’s not meant to be a learning exercise, I’d say using an external tool will be faster, more accurate"
1195,2017-10-24T05:01:17.000457,Kayce,Regex evaluated an input of 8 spaces to 6
1195,2017-10-24T05:02:02.000241,Kayce,=/ I'm no bueno with regex
1195,2017-10-24T05:02:19.000329,Junita,probably worth practicing with them to get better than instead of avoiding them.  :stuck_out_tongue:
1195,2017-10-24T05:03:29.000516,Kayce,True! I don't come across them terribly often though! Any sharp regex knowledge quickly fades after a week.
1195,2017-10-24T05:06:08.000026,Junita,"<@Ines> also, it goes without saying, backup these files first.  :stuck_out_tongue:"
1195,2017-10-24T05:17:14.000195,Ines,"<@Junita> :)))))))) of course it goes without saying. although, replace would have made the backup automatically. also, I don’t necessary agree that an external tool would be faster, unless your talking faster from a processing point of view. this “app” I’m writing has the ability to search the project structure recursively and finds all files I want to modify by looking at their extensions (which are parametrised so I can specify whatever extension I want), and reformats all files according to my needs, which are also parametrised. you will have the chance to take a look at the end result on github after I finish it. and if you’re asking yourself where did the need came from, all our JavaScript files have been indented with 4 spaces, but we want to switch to the recommended standard of 2 spaces :slightly_smiling_face:"
1195,2017-10-24T05:18:46.000203,Junita,most editors/ides have something to do that project wide
1195,2017-10-24T05:19:25.000147,Junita,how would replace have done that automatically though?  Maybe I’m misunderstanding what you said you had done already?
1195,2017-10-24T05:23:40.000362,Ines,"to be honest, I didn’t find how to do it in my IDE of choice, and neither using external plugins or other apps, either for my IDE or for a different editor. I’m pretty sure that there might be tools and probably even an implicit way of doing it in my IDE, it just wasn’t easy to find so I took this as a good opportunity to write a small python app :slightly_smiling_face: I think you understood what I’m trying to do, taking into consideration your commentaries. I can switch to a different standard in my IDE, it just won’t replace the existing format :slightly_smiling_face:"
1195,2017-10-24T05:23:49.000293,Ines,<@Junita> thanks again
1195,2017-10-24T05:24:39.000133,Junita,"np, and yeah doesn’t hurt to do it as a learning exercise!"
1196,2017-10-24T06:51:21.000128,Omar,"Can someone explain to me what virtual envs are?
How/why are they used? And maybe how I can/should start using them?"
1196,2017-10-24T06:53:18.000270,Vada,<@Omar> virtualenvs are segregated python installations you use for each individual project you run.
1196,2017-10-24T06:53:54.000091,Vada,"This way each project gets it's own python installation (whichever version you want), it's own environmental variables and, most importantly, it's own third part packages."
1196,2017-10-24T06:54:40.000206,Vada,It avoids mixing dependencies between projects so you don't have any clashes
1196,2017-10-24T06:55:02.000210,Vada,also means that you have a defined set of dependencies for each project which can be easily translated into a requirements.txt file
1196,2017-10-24T06:55:27.000123,Vada,the easiest way to use it (in my opinion) is by installing this libary: <http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#basic-installation>

1197,2017-10-24T07:35:25.000068,Amee,i used easy_install to install pip
1197,2017-10-24T07:35:42.000085,Vada,it probably defaulted to python2 pip
1197,2017-10-24T07:35:44.000194,Vada,try pip3
1197,2017-10-24T07:35:48.000135,Vada,see if that command works
1197,2017-10-24T07:35:56.000079,Vada,and remove the old flake8 before you reinstall it via pip3
1197,2017-10-24T07:36:28.000167,Amee,ok ill give that a go :smile:
1197,2017-10-24T07:39:13.000273,Amee,"stange though as i have never ran into this issue before, but ill try and remove flake from 2.7.1"
1197,2017-10-24T07:39:16.000419,Amee,thanks guys
1197,2017-10-24T07:44:47.000207,Amee,following these steps are the correct way to install the latest version of python though right?
1197,2017-10-24T07:44:56.000135,Amee,then id just use python3 and pip3  ?
1197,2017-10-24T07:45:02.000045,Amee,<http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/#install3-osx>
1197,2017-10-24T07:47:40.000250,Meg,especially if you see `which pip` pointing to 2.7
1197,2017-10-24T07:47:54.000187,Meg,"but if you do `pip3`, it should point to your 3.x install"
1198,2017-10-24T07:47:23.000245,Meg,yep
1198,2017-10-24T07:57:40.000230,Collette,"If you're confused which pip points to which python, it's better to call `python3.5 -m pip`"
1198,2017-10-24T07:57:49.000111,Collette,Then you'll get a correct version of pip for sure
1199,2017-10-24T10:04:00.000290,Bruno,cool thanks.
1200,2017-10-24T10:15:15.000448,Lory,Does anyone know of some good reading material on python's setup tools? I feel like most of the articles I've come across are just a waste of time
1200,2017-10-24T10:20:43.000114,Meg,how so?  what’s lacking?
1200,2017-10-24T10:28:03.000070,Lory,"I feel like all the tutorials/articles/etc have read as if the person they're trying to teach already knows the stuff and I haven't been able to fully pull out all the pieces that make it work. Like specifically how to structure your package with an __init__.py and why you can leave it empty and why you may or may not want to. How to do simple local pip installs of your project if you're not interested in publishing on pypi, like in the case of a webapp"
1200,2017-10-24T10:29:06.000366,Lory,"I feel like they are all hyper focused on going from project to pypi and these are the steps to get there without ever really explaining anything. By ""they"" I just mean various articles I've found by googling from trusted sources to random people writing blog posts"
1200,2017-10-24T10:52:28.000563,Vita,"Just now seeing these responses (sorry). 
<@Seema> Ok, was the panel from this year? I would love to check it out
<@Ronni> I agree unit tests are easier to write, and I actually want functional tests more for a documentation for the devs to know the workflow more than anything. I was really shocked when I left a project for a year to come back to it and instantly understand where I left off and what needs to be done because of functional tests with user story comments"
1200,2017-10-24T10:57:57.000121,Johana,What pieces are you looking for <@Lory>?
1200,2017-10-24T10:59:44.000882,Johana,It kinda sounds like structuring python projects.
1200,2017-10-24T11:01:11.000247,Johana,I know this is a little bit of a lengthy video but it is by :dabeaz: and it enlightened me to python packages and imports (not pypi). <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oTh1CXRaQ0>
1200,2017-10-24T11:06:06.000525,Johana,I’m a bit partial to using sqlalchemy. it isn’t touted as the best library for beginners but learning it will definitely pay dividends.
1200,2017-10-24T11:06:23.000621,Johana,it’s the defacto library for working with relational databases in python
1200,2017-10-24T11:08:33.000209,Johana,I like django. i believe you can use the orm if you like separately from the web application.
1200,2017-10-24T11:09:38.000641,Burma,the function is to make queries to a monitoring DB
1200,2017-10-24T11:11:25.000117,Johana,How familiar are you with SQL?
1200,2017-10-24T11:12:02.000731,Burma,from 1 to 10 I would say 3
1200,2017-10-24T11:12:08.000525,Burma,maybe 4
1200,2017-10-24T11:13:01.000356,Johana,ok so if you were to write raw sql queries you would have to learn SQL.
1200,2017-10-24T11:13:11.000516,Johana,so that would probably take the most time/effort.
1200,2017-10-24T11:13:28.000487,Johana,if you were to try and use the sqlalchemy orm you could work with the database in a more object oriented manner.
1200,2017-10-24T11:13:36.000226,Johana,which is a bit easier for beginners.
1200,2017-10-24T11:13:59.000556,Johana,:point_up: this snippet will show you how you can reflect the database and start querying it.
1200,2017-10-24T11:14:33.000018,Burma,ok sounds good not that I don't mind putting the time in and learning to write sql queries
1200,2017-10-24T11:14:53.000401,Johana,"yea, i’m not saying you do. i’m thinking in perspective of time usage."
1200,2017-10-24T11:15:26.000203,Johana,you would need to alter the connection string and it will work for mysql.
1200,2017-10-24T11:15:39.000210,Johana,that’s the beauty of using something like sqlalchemy. it has abstracted the nuances of the different databases.
1200,2017-10-24T11:15:50.000311,Johana,if you want to switch to postgres you can pretty much just change the connection string.
1200,2017-10-24T11:16:51.000527,Burma,yea I know exactly what you mean by the time efficiency
1200,2017-10-24T11:16:55.000344,Johana,and all your queries will work. you can’t say that with raw sql.
1200,2017-10-24T11:17:27.000024,Johana,that’s the power of sqlalchemy. you never have to worry about if you can talk to a database. it pretty much covers all the major relational databases out there.
1200,2017-10-24T11:17:45.000356,Johana,I can add some explanation to the snippet.
1200,2017-10-24T11:17:58.000295,Johana,essentially what is happening is in sqlalchemy you need an `engine`.
1200,2017-10-24T11:18:07.000066,Johana,this engine is the connection to the DBAPI.
1200,2017-10-24T11:18:14.000098,Johana,it generates sql queries for you.
1200,2017-10-24T11:18:21.000084,Johana,The ORM is built on top of that.
1200,2017-10-24T11:18:40.000352,Johana,You need the `session` which is bound to the `engine` in order to use the ORM.
1200,2017-10-24T11:19:36.000167,Johana,"you could use the engine alone. or you can use the session. if you decide to use the session you have to use SQLAlchemy’s Expression language which looks like SQL, `select([Users.c.name]).where(Users.c.name == 'mike')`"
1200,2017-10-24T11:20:04.000028,Johana,"that’s the equivalent of
```
SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE name = 'mike'
```"
1200,2017-10-24T11:20:21.000548,Johana,The ORM provides a more declarative way to talk to the database.
1200,2017-10-24T11:20:49.000278,Johana,You essentially create a class that represents the table in your database.
1200,2017-10-24T11:20:57.000102,Burma,and just to get this right the session interacts with the ORM ?
1200,2017-10-24T11:20:58.000749,Johana,I’m doing that above by reflecting the db.
1200,2017-10-24T11:21:03.000084,Johana,yes!
1200,2017-10-24T11:21:21.000466,Johana,the session is like a recorder. You can add things to it (insert) you can take things away(delete) etc.
1200,2017-10-24T11:21:56.000677,Johana,"If you want to add a user you can do something like this:
```
user = User(name='mike)
session.add(user)
session.commit()
```"
1200,2017-10-24T11:22:11.000018,Burma,So i guess session maybe the way to go then again I wouldnt mind learning the engine as well but it might be more of a learning curve
1200,2017-10-24T11:22:21.000219,Johana,so now you can work with the database as you would any other python object.
1200,2017-10-24T11:22:28.000316,Johana,i would learn the core after the ORM.
1200,2017-10-24T11:22:48.000149,Johana,SQLAlchemy is stand-alone so you can integrate it into anything.
1200,2017-10-24T11:22:55.000133,Johana,"a CLI app you got it, a web app you goit."
1200,2017-10-24T11:23:29.000796,Johana,here is a flask app that uses sqlalchemy. <https://gist.github.com/m1yag1/d354ab69398ab84f72f9e0b8c712ffb6>
1200,2017-10-24T11:23:41.000011,Burma,nice thats pretty damn cool !
1200,2017-10-24T11:23:57.000469,Johana,check out lines 171-87
1200,2017-10-24T11:24:09.000030,Johana,that’s a class model of the table in the database.
1200,2017-10-24T11:24:30.000103,Johana,it’s faster if you model your database this way. you may have to do that. or you can reflect the db like in my first example.
1200,2017-10-24T11:25:04.000157,Johana,sqlacodegen is a library that can generate a models.py file for you by reflecting the database.
1200,2017-10-24T11:27:15.000333,Johana,i’ve successfully ported applications using this very feature from microsoft sql server to postgresql.
1200,2017-10-24T11:28:54.000413,Burma,if you don't mind me asking ```sqlacodegen is a library that can generate a models.py file for you by reflecting the database ?```
1200,2017-10-24T11:29:35.000317,Johana,typically an ORM or database library needs to “know” how the database schema looks like.
1200,2017-10-24T11:29:35.000595,Burma,why would I have to reflect my database ? in this this instance
1200,2017-10-24T11:29:39.000267,Johana,it does this via reflection.
1200,2017-10-24T11:29:51.000479,Johana,it’s just an easy way to start working with the database.
1200,2017-10-24T11:29:53.000350,Burma,:+1:
1200,2017-10-24T11:29:58.000685,Johana,i use it a lot to do adhoc queries.
1200,2017-10-24T11:30:09.000084,Johana,i do not recommend it for applications with a lot of db tables.
1200,2017-10-24T11:30:21.000016,Johana,it can slow things down trying to “reverse engineer” the database schema if the database has tons of tables.
1200,2017-10-24T11:30:52.000496,Burma,hmm makes sense
1200,2017-10-24T11:31:09.000416,Johana,i wrote an app a couple years back that would reflect a database and provide a web api for CRUD on all the tables. it took like 10minutes to reflect the db.
1200,2017-10-24T11:31:10.000743,Johana,lol
1200,2017-10-24T11:31:19.000479,Johana,CRUD = create update and delete
1200,2017-10-24T11:32:30.000915,Burma,lol must of been extremely heavy yea basically I'll be making direct queries with an nagios like monitoring tool
1200,2017-10-24T11:32:56.000817,Burma,but I''l be pulling values directly from the DB
1200,2017-10-24T11:33:14.000889,Burma,but this should help me more than enough to get started
1200,2017-10-24T11:33:18.000300,Johana,that’s fine.
1200,2017-10-24T11:33:32.000432,Johana,you can even create another engine for another db and and save to a different database lol.
1200,2017-10-24T11:33:38.000264,Johana,if you needed to save locally for example.
1200,2017-10-24T11:35:16.000495,Burma,Interesting Yea I'll certainly take that idea Thanks again man <@Johana> :+1:
1200,2017-10-24T11:35:32.000230,Johana,"np, i came into python via sqlalchemy i was a DBA in a past life :wink:."
1200,2017-10-24T11:36:13.000777,Johana,i got into web dev b/c i wanted to show data quickly to business users so then flask was a nice fit.
1200,2017-10-24T11:36:43.000236,Johana,as a past database administrator i can tell you for a fact sqlalchemy is bad ass.
1200,2017-10-24T11:37:03.000410,Johana,it is 10years old after all.
1200,2017-10-24T11:38:04.000445,Johana,let me know how it goes <@Burma>
1200,2017-10-24T11:39:25.000677,Lory,"<@Johana> I am trying to create a workflow for my buddy and I to work on a couple different webapps. Basically it consists of our local computers, the server where svn is hosting all my projects and then the production server to host the live webserver. I was talking with a coworker about it and he had mentioned setuptools might be useful for installing the projects out on the live server rather than having a make file just call *svn up* out on the production server. Setuptools is something I've avoided for a long while so I may not be explaining myself very well"
1200,2017-10-24T11:40:33.000383,Johana,setuptools isn’t going to go put it on your server. you can use distutils to create a source distribution which is fine.
1200,2017-10-24T11:40:49.000270,Johana,it will essentially create a tarball of your app you can copy to the server and extract.
1200,2017-10-24T11:41:07.000142,Johana,you’ll use distutils for that.
1200,2017-10-24T11:41:43.000496,Johana,"Personally, i would use something like ansible or docker to deploy your app."
1200,2017-10-24T11:42:44.000288,Johana,two things for that you will need a `<http://Manifest.in|Manifest.in>` file and `setup.py`
1200,2017-10-24T11:43:50.000208,Johana,the idea is to create what is known as a “build artifact”.
1200,2017-10-24T11:44:29.000007,Burma,Will do <@Johana>
1200,2017-10-24T11:45:36.000566,Johana,a build artifact is like a windows .exe or a .deb file or a python wheel.
1200,2017-10-24T11:48:35.000500,Johana,if you go the ansible route you can create a playbook with your buddy and only have your keys on the server so that only you two can deploy.
1200,2017-10-24T11:49:24.000468,Johana,you can checkout pyslackers github for examples: <https://github.com/pyslackers/website/blob/master/ansible/playbook.yml>
1200,2017-10-24T12:03:35.000853,Johana,i’m a bit busy but i’ll be back with an example :wink:
1200,2017-10-24T12:08:28.000320,Johana,"this is the ansible task that I have that creates a source distro before it copies it to my server:
```
- name: Create source distribution
  sudo: false
  local_action: shell source {{ pylocal_venv }}/bin/activate &amp;&amp;  python setup.py clean sdist chdir=""{{ pylocal_source_dir }}"" executable=""/bin/bash""
  run_once: true
```"
1200,2017-10-24T12:08:53.000376,Johana,replace the jinja tags with the proper values
1200,2017-10-24T12:09:47.000043,Johana,`source virtualenv_path/bin/activate &amp;&amp;  python setup.py clean sdist chdir=/application/dir`
1200,2017-10-24T12:12:26.000464,Johana,you can then scp or sftp the source distro to the server.
1200,2017-10-24T12:12:31.000053,Johana,if you want to do it manually.
1200,2017-10-24T12:15:53.000399,Johana,"in ansible extracting an archive is pretty easy:

```
- name: Copy and extract source onto server
  unarchive:

1207,2017-10-25T08:21:28.000258,Neomi,Hi all . I need slack nodejs group can i help me ? 
1208,2017-10-25T11:41:21.000881,Lory,What's the code that spit that out?
1208,2017-10-25T11:43:18.000249,Chong,do you want the full error stack
1208,2017-10-25T11:44:18.000620,Lory,that would probably be helpful
1208,2017-10-25T11:44:45.000287,Lory,and the code itself that you were running that initially threw an error if that's not the original trace back
1208,2017-10-25T11:52:13.000478,Amee,"from the list here: <https://teamtreehouse.com/library/topic:python/q:python> which ones do you think i should go for next, i have done the python basics. and the practice ones"
1208,2017-10-25T12:08:57.000554,Lory,<@Amee> I always think the best way to learn is to work on a project that interests you. In building it out you will learn several concepts and strengthen your knowledge on concepts you already know

1209,2017-10-25T12:21:58.000002,Mallie,"It's come out of nowhere, and doesn't happen on other systems"
1209,2017-10-25T12:26:27.000761,Suellen,"&gt; 14.04
:open_mouth:"
1209,2017-10-25T12:27:10.000569,Suellen,you should update openssl
1209,2017-10-25T12:30:17.000353,Mallie,That is what I ended up doing successfully after a few tries - turns out the overall issue was an incompatibility between `cryptography` and `pyOpenSSL`
1209,2017-10-25T12:30:32.000477,Mallie,"But it was silent, and neither of the versions had changed (or at least, I hadn't planned on them changing)"
1209,2017-10-25T12:31:09.000629,Lory,good ol' revision incompatibility
1209,2017-10-25T12:33:25.000699,Mallie,So now they are both up-to-date I guess? yay lol
1210,2017-10-25T12:45:41.000313,Frieda,Go check the Tracks area and do the Learn Python track
1211,2017-10-25T14:10:43.000306,Margrett,"So, I find myself recreating an existing Java application in Python.  One aspect is to generate an output XML file that must conform to a DTD file.  I've been using lxml.etree for generating the xml file.  

I have one problem.  The DTD requires certain types of nodes to occur before other types.    Before I start write sorting logic, is there anything that would consult a specified DTD and sort accordingly?"
1211,2017-10-25T14:11:55.000098,Margrett,"Assuming no, any best practice on sorting peer nodes by node-type?"
1211,2017-10-25T14:36:18.000028,Meg,"<@Margrett>, I’m drawing a blank, sorry"
1211,2017-10-25T14:41:14.000003,Mallie,"<@Margrett> Sorting? I'm confused, why don't you just define your schema or add the nodes in the correct order?"
1212,2017-10-25T14:36:39.000670,Meg,are you looking for something like with spring beans xml configuration?
1212,2017-10-25T14:37:37.000653,Meg,something along the lines of importing <http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd> and going from there?
1212,2017-10-25T14:41:16.000512,Johana,i don’t think so. you’ll have to generate the file and then validate it.
1212,2017-10-25T14:41:34.000338,Johana,unless there is something new. I used to do HL7 messaging which had a similar workflow.
1212,2017-10-25T14:41:42.000320,Mallie,"Oh I re-read - to move from invalid to a valid schema, :disappointed:"
1212,2017-10-25T14:42:56.000223,Mallie,Anything trying to be more clever than <@Johana> suggestion is probably just going to make things worse
1212,2017-10-25T14:43:35.000195,Johana,it would be hard to catch all the edge cases.
1212,2017-10-25T14:44:23.000135,Johana,you might be able to do something creative with a jinja2 template.
1212,2017-10-25T14:44:45.000451,Johana,i did that once with some HL7 messages.
1212,2017-10-25T14:51:56.000657,Johana,"```
{% for person in persons %}
  &lt;person&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;{{ person.name }}&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/person&gt;
{% endif %}
```"
1212,2017-10-25T14:54:12.000280,Johana,<@Margrett> :point_up: I don’t know how much your data is changing but your schema definition should help you build the template. Then all you need to do is pass in all the data and it automagically shows up in the right order…
1212,2017-10-25T14:55:43.000168,Johana,then you don’t even have to fiddle with any xml at all just data. :wink:
1212,2017-10-25T15:11:12.000049,Margrett,Thanks for the responses.  Part of the tools purpose is to transform unstructured data from old systems into a nice tidy XML that our product understands.
1212,2017-10-25T15:12:06.000207,Margrett,I'm converting it form a pure GUI to a backend python module + GUI
1212,2017-10-25T15:12:23.000035,Margrett,"So, I don't know what wacky things my end-users are going to do."
1212,2017-10-25T15:13:03.000151,Johana,you might also look into what capabilities pycharm has with xml. it is quite powerful when it comes to xml.
1212,2017-10-25T15:13:07.000157,Margrett,I think I've settled on adding a hidden `_sort_rank = integer` to each of my ~40 object types
1212,2017-10-25T15:13:35.000119,Margrett,"Then, using bisect to do sorted inserts as objects are child objects are added"
1212,2017-10-25T15:13:55.000114,Margrett,"I wasn't planning on sorting that early, but I'm now realizing it could have a hidden payoff in the GUI phase"
1212,2017-10-25T15:14:03.000452,Johana,looks like a fun challenge.
1212,2017-10-25T15:14:11.000312,Johana,except for the xml part.
1212,2017-10-25T15:14:18.000375,Johana,xml bleh.
1212,2017-10-25T15:14:36.000175,Margrett,"Lol, XML has been my constant love/hate relationship for ~10 years."
1212,2017-10-25T15:14:47.000509,Johana,but i know how it is. HL7 was for health system integration and it was the most complex xml crap i have ever dealt with.
1212,2017-10-25T15:16:10.000104,Margrett,"My favorite part was the early days of 32 bit applications.  $1,000+ ""enterprise"" XML editors that were unable to open a 10 MB xml file."
1212,2017-10-25T15:16:44.000084,Margrett,"Watched them start opening the file, then shoot to using 2GB of memory, then either freeze or crash."
1212,2017-10-25T15:16:51.000237,Margrett,No idea what they heck they were doing
1212,2017-10-25T15:20:02.000554,Margrett,"More silly XML stuff.  A past employer purchased an XML based workflow processing engine / app server that we apparently spent so much on, we had to delay reporting earnings."
1212,2017-10-25T15:20:14.000499,Margrett,"My team was told to use it, but I never had training on it, on a big project.  I continued to write my logic in XLST, because it was what I used for everything else."
1212,2017-10-25T15:20:17.000382,Johana,is it an EDI app?
1212,2017-10-25T15:20:52.000055,Johana,something like Rhapsody?
1212,2017-10-25T15:20:58.000038,Margrett,What I'm writing now?
1212,2017-10-25T15:21:08.000127,Johana,the XML based workflow processing engine
1212,2017-10-25T15:21:16.000586,Johana,those are typically called EDI apps
1212,2017-10-25T15:21:29.000397,Johana,Electronic Data Interchange
1212,2017-10-25T15:21:53.000209,Johana,i’ve worked with a few. just curious.
1212,2017-10-25T15:22:33.000579,Margrett,"Kind of.  We were using it to enhance our identity management solution.  So grab events from PeopleSoft, then propagate changes in a bunch of login systems and purchasing apps."
1212,2017-10-25T15:22:47.000038,Margrett,Then reverse that process when someone gets terminated
1212,2017-10-25T15:23:02.000444,Johana,yea and you have to move little widgets around.
1212,2017-10-25T15:23:35.000138,Margrett,"So, the XLST stuff was processing this giant XML doc in ~2 seconds"
1212,2017-10-25T15:23:54.000113,Margrett,"We ported everything into this big expensive engine, and it was &gt;1 hour"
1212,2017-10-25T15:25:42.000103,Johana,i mainly used it to report results of infections diseases to the USDA.
1212,2017-10-25T15:25:49.000214,Margrett,That looks way more sophisticated than we had.
1212,2017-10-25T15:26:20.000689,Margrett,I'm struggling to remember the name.   The whole thing was web based.
1212,2017-10-25T15:27:38.000235,Margrett,"I did write code in Symantec Workflow, looks a little more similar."
1212,2017-10-25T15:34:00.000243,Margrett,SilverStream
1212,2017-10-25T15:35:21.000556,Johana,gotta love windows nt.
1212,2017-10-25T15:36:51.000305,Johana,ah i see you build web apps in it and it will deploy them at a very expensive cost.
1212,2017-10-25T15:51:36.000617,Johana,"the big benefit i see a system that is geared for sending XML messages is that they typically have logging, retrying, etc. built in. It makes it really nice to just set it up and forget about it. I remember sometimes my workflow might hang up but the help desk guy had a login where he could restart the process."
1213,2017-10-25T15:46:54.000200,Johana,mirth may be able to do what you want as well. it’s opensource and geared to HL7 but HL7 is XML like anything else so i’m sure it can do a lot.
1213,2017-10-25T15:52:37.000433,Margrett,I would have killed for that back in ID mgmt days.
1214,2017-10-25T15:55:45.000163,Elsie,"Hey all, would anyone know how to, using requests, to add a time.sleep to the requests get call and read the page after a number of seconds?"
1214,2017-10-25T16:03:29.000228,Antionette,<@Elsie> afaik requests only includes functionality for a single request and is blocking so if you want to space out multiple requests you should be able to add the delay yourself in between
1214,2017-10-25T16:04:09.000049,Elsie,Ok and excuse my ignorance but would I be calling for the same url?
1214,2017-10-25T16:05:17.000279,Antionette,"Hmmm, that depends on what you're trying to do? Maybe take a step back and explain your overall goal?"
1214,2017-10-25T16:07:37.000218,Elsie,Essentially scrape a page that has ajax calls or is built with react on their frontend
1214,2017-10-25T16:08:24.000207,Antionette,"ohhh, then ignore my previous answer"
1214,2017-10-25T16:08:52.000706,Antionette,"requests will just return the content from a single request, it will not render any javascript"
1214,2017-10-25T16:09:33.000669,Elsie,So would their be any work around to this other than running a selenium script?
1214,2017-10-25T16:09:37.000564,Elsie,there*
1214,2017-10-25T16:10:26.000323,Mallie,"You can hit up <#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping>, they'll probably get into the nitty gritty more"
1214,2017-10-25T16:10:33.000149,Mirian,"I don't know any alternatives. When I was in that situation, I just used selenium"
1214,2017-10-25T16:11:43.000272,Antionette,"Yeah I'd agree with <@Mallie>, go to <#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping> if you can/want to talk about it in more detail. Overall the two approaches would be to use a browser engine/driver like selenium or be able to identify the ajax calls being made and then make those requests directly yourself"
1214,2017-10-25T16:11:56.000132,Elsie,ok thanks all

1216,2017-10-25T21:01:05.000032,Rosita,is there anything in Python that will take a dictionary / array of whatever structure and convert it to JSON as is? Everything I have seen so far is about defining serializers etc?
1216,2017-10-25T21:02:04.000179,Johana,Json.dumps()
1216,2017-10-25T21:02:29.000063,Rosita,doesnt do nested objects?
1216,2017-10-25T21:03:42.000235,Rosita,e.g. if I have django model that has several other relationships fetched as part of a query it only ever encodes the first level
1216,2017-10-25T21:04:42.000178,Johana,I'm not sure about a Django model.
1216,2017-10-25T21:05:04.000162,Rosita,well just think of it as nested objects
1216,2017-10-25T21:05:15.000028,Rosita,there doesnt seem to be anything analogous to PHP's json_encode
1216,2017-10-25T21:05:47.000280,Rosita,Which will take a nested object and recursively convert it to JSON
1216,2017-10-25T21:06:41.000150,Johana,I typically add a to_dict method to my sqlalchemy models.. I'm on a phone rn
1216,2017-10-25T21:07:11.000214,Rosita,yeah I saw that on some stuff I looked at - I guess id have to define one for each model
1216,2017-10-25T21:07:15.000270,Rosita,painful
1216,2017-10-25T21:14:18.000067,Marcie,"the django rest framework supports nested serializers, might be handy to look at their implementation if you're not using their framework"
1216,2017-10-25T21:14:37.000224,Johana,no you could simply create a mixin.
1216,2017-10-25T21:15:11.000150,Johana,yea drf has all sorts of options for depth.
1216,2017-10-25T21:21:08.000147,Rosita,everything I have seen with DRF requires me to declare the structure of the object
1216,2017-10-25T21:21:32.000180,Rosita,e.g. PersonObject -&gt; HeadObject -&gt; EyeObject etc
1216,2017-10-25T21:21:50.000025,Rosita,This seems overly verbose
1216,2017-10-25T21:22:58.000160,Rosita,I'm surprised there doesnt seem to be a one size fits all approach to this for a web framework like Django / DRF
1216,2017-10-25T21:23:12.000171,Rosita,I think the __dict method seems the cleanest and most re-usable
1216,2017-10-25T21:24:28.000185,Johana,you could try flask. it’s pretty simple to get a web api going.
1216,2017-10-25T21:26:02.000010,Rosita,Ive inherited a Django project unfortunately
1216,2017-10-25T21:26:57.000132,Rosita,Just frustrating when you are used to doing things a different and faster way
1216,2017-10-25T21:27:39.000007,Marcie,i had this frustration working with django originally but then i had a few more developers join me on a django rest framework and that verbosity made things a lot nicer to work with
1216,2017-10-25T21:30:34.000113,Rosita,If it was a full on REST API it wouldnt be so bad but I literally just want to produce some JSON for some charts and i cant even do that
1216,2017-10-25T21:30:56.000069,Rosita,its a 2 minute job in PHP :disappointed:
1216,2017-10-25T21:31:41.000089,Rosita,If Django didnt produce such an easy admin id have considered rewriting it already
1216,2017-10-25T21:42:36.000007,Winnifred,"_gasp_ @ ""inherited a Django project unfortunately"""
1216,2017-10-25T21:47:42.000006,Johana,yea it’s hard to compete with PHP. :troll:

This requires us to not only closely review a freelancer’s talents and experience, but also balance those with the availability of projects. For example, at times our marketplace may have too many freelancers with similar skills competing for the number of projects that are available. To avoid the frustration that goes along with that, we must limit the number of new freelancers that can join our website. While you cannot submit proposals for jobs right now, the number of available jobs and freelancers vary throughout the year. We can offer a few suggestions for going forward:
If you have more relevant skills or experience to add now or in the future as you develop them, you can update and re-submit your application and we’ll take another look to see if there is a demand for your new skills.

i've made 3 websites.
3 python programs: Netcat replica, Spirograph animator, snake game replica.

I get what you mean about me not being an ideal freelancer yet, and your absolutely right, my plan was to take small jobs and slowly build up a portfolio, and then when confident enough try bidding on making entire websites and such.

But in my profile i say i'm not an expert, i've my experince level to entry level, i can see they a lot of job where people ask for cheap rookie people who wants a challenge, so i don't understand why i can't get a shot :disappointed:

1222,2017-10-26T09:55:09.000451,Yan,"Hi mattes.
I need to change an ImmutableMultiDict to a simple dict.

Have this:
ImmutableMultiDict([('*conciliation_status*', 'NC'), ('*conciliation_status*', 'CA'), ('group_id', '1'), ('end_date', '2017-12-31'), ('start_date', '2017-01-01')])

and need this:
{'*conciliation_status*': ['NC', 'CA'], 'group_id': '1', 'end_date': '2017-12-31', 'start_date': '2017-01-01'}

I could resolve this case with something like this:
```
def normalize(data):
    normalized_data = {}

    for key, value in dict(data).items():
        if len(value) &gt; 1:
            normalized_data[key] = value
        else:
            normalized_data[key] = value[0]

    return normalized_data
```

But I wonder if there are others betters ways to do this.
Any idea?"

1227,2017-10-27T08:40:19.000285,Virgen,Good morning everyone!!! (its morning here in EST)
1228,2017-10-27T08:40:27.000035,Virgen,"I am quite novice and need a little direction.
Just point me in the direction and I am happy to figure it out from there. I learn better that way. 
I am trying to write a program to ping all hosts in a subnet and then display the results in a table.
What I have already. (both found somewhere on the internet and modified for my needs...)
1. A ""ping sweep"" that will output the IP and DNS name of any host that respondes.
2. A simple Plotly program that will read a CSV and output it in an HTML table."
1228,2017-10-27T08:40:35.000163,Virgen,.

Ideas? 
I am currently reading up on dictionaries and seeing if that may serve my purpose...
Thank you for any help!!!"
1228,2017-10-27T09:32:26.000553,Lory,<@Virgen> you already have your data being parsed from the csv? You can use jinja templates to dynamically build the results into the table
1228,2017-10-27T09:34:53.000317,Virgen,negative. the plotly bit is just pulling data from a random test csv.
1228,2017-10-27T09:35:36.000093,Virgen,the ping sweep bit runs an if/then loop which tests each IP and returns the IP and DNS name if anything responds.
1228,2017-10-27T09:38:49.000531,Virgen,"<@Lory> I'll check into jinja as well, thx!"
1228,2017-10-27T09:39:00.000186,Lory,"can you pop that into a code block, can't tell where the indentation is supposed to be"
1228,2017-10-27T09:39:12.000604,Lory,little plus sign next to the text input
1228,2017-10-27T09:41:06.000711,Meg,<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks>
1228,2017-10-27T10:06:51.000069,Virgen,"<@Lory> I cannot, I get an upload error. I blame the webfilter and its admin... (i'm the webfilter admin...)"
1228,2017-10-27T10:14:10.000368,Virgen,<@Lory> I got the webfilter admin to fix his gear...
1228,2017-10-27T10:15:27.000108,Virgen,"that's the general loop that outputs the data. So, rather than just printing the output to console, I want to store it in a way that can be read into and displayed in a table."
1228,2017-10-27T10:17:23.000029,Lory,"well for starters, that initial for loop where you're running `ping` on the servers, you're only ever capturing the output of the last one that runs in `output`, unless `stdout=...` is supposed to be within the for loop which it looks like it should be but is just an indentation error"
1228,2017-10-27T10:19:10.000295,Lory,yea so I would build some kind of dictionary or nested list and then use a jinja template to iterate over that data structure and create a table entry for each. That would definitely be a fairly easy approach

1228,2017-10-27T10:22:21.000348,Lory,<@Desire> You mean give 0 a higher probability?
1228,2017-10-27T10:23:12.000617,Suellen,`random.choices()` has an ability to assign weights to choices
1228,2017-10-27T10:25:12.000485,Virgen,<@Lory> Interesting. I will check out jinja. thank you!

1228,2017-10-27T10:26:16.000587,Lory,"There are other approaches than jinja, but basically you want some way to template in data into table rows and then send that to the web page. There are other options out there, jinja is just what I'm used to personally"

1229,2017-10-27T12:02:30.000679,Seema,"Of course googling ""debugging multiple inheritance python"" returns inheritance tutorials :confused: "
1229,2017-10-27T12:02:56.000778,Winnifred,have you checked the `.__mro__`  attr on your class?
1229,2017-10-27T12:04:33.000467,Winnifred,mro = method resolution order and shows how your classes attrs are being built
1229,2017-10-27T12:04:45.000468,Seema,I have not.  I was about to get into the class tree PyCharm debugging but went on a walk (now)
1229,2017-10-27T12:05:27.000329,Meg,"and Python MRO is right to left, IIRC"
1229,2017-10-27T12:05:58.000328,Seema,I'm using Dask and it's got all this lazy executes on top of pandas and I think I'm getting lost in the weeds instead of high level
1229,2017-10-27T12:07:18.000348,Winnifred,"also, if there are `super` delegations, the last evaluated class goes to the base `type` class (i think) or metaclass"
1229,2017-10-27T12:07:38.000080,Winnifred,im being much too glib -- I would check out stuff around the method resolution order though :slightly_smiling_face:

1231,2017-10-27T13:09:56.000403,Tanya,Not so helpful for straight up debugging but it helped me understand python's MRO.
1232,2017-10-27T16:08:33.000492,Dorris,Why would a class' attribute that is supposed to be set as a string end up as a tuple instead when a string is passed to self.attributename? I have a class where under __init__ it is using parameter names to pass in values to the attributes of the class object but when I pass in a string it turns it into a tuple with one value in it.
1232,2017-10-27T16:08:50.000285,Lory,can you post the code in a snippet?
1232,2017-10-27T16:10:31.000308,Ciera,"<@Dorris> are you sure the string isn't ending with a `,`"
1232,2017-10-27T16:10:47.000166,Ciera,"`a = 'hello world', ` would create a tuple for example"
1232,2017-10-27T16:12:20.000301,Dorris,"When debugging and I look at the value being passed in there is no `,`"
1232,2017-10-27T16:12:32.000238,Dorris,Let me see if I can show you
1232,2017-10-27T16:12:39.000419,Lory,`crmwebapi` is what's returning a tuple?

1232,2017-10-27T16:16:56.000471,Ciera,"actually yeah they are all tuple because you put a `,` a the end"
1232,2017-10-27T16:17:09.000354,Ciera,it's only needed when creating a dict

1232,2017-10-27T16:21:08.000228,Suellen,parenthesis don't make a tuple

I have a package whose actual name has an underscore `my_package`, but in the setup.py, for the name attribute, I accidentally put `name=""my package""` - I ran setup.py a few times with success, before realizing it was naming the package `my-package`. Now, I've fixed the name so it's `name=""my_package""`, but setuptools keeps putting `my-package` in the PKG-INFO file. I've looked everywhere for any trace of the name with a hyphen or a space, I've deleted the caches, run `setup.py clean`, changed the name to something else entirely, removed the parameter, traced through the setuptools code to see how it's set, and I can't get it to stop naming it `my-package` in PKG-INFO.

I need some help in this very personal project: I’m working on a platform that makes it easier for people to find solutions for their career concerns. Now I’m trying to understand how the experienced professionals give career advice. 
Would anybody with more than 5 years of experience allow me to make an audio call with for 30 minutes? Please DM me. Thank you very much in advance. Wish you have a great day/evening!:+1:"

1237,2017-10-29T10:45:45.000007,Suellen,???
1237,2017-10-29T10:45:50.000100,Suellen,1 + 9 = 10
1237,2017-10-29T10:48:01.000018,Leif,"<@Suellen> yep, ill show you a screenshot :laughing:"
1237,2017-10-29T10:50:16.000061,Suellen,"no, that's not what I meant"
1237,2017-10-29T10:50:24.000016,Suellen,I mean.. one plus nine is ten.. right?
1237,2017-10-29T10:50:32.000036,Suellen,why is this result surprising?
1237,2017-10-29T10:51:18.000006,Leif,oh right ._.
1237,2017-10-29T10:51:55.000040,Leif,Well Thanks for answering. Yeah i was totally wrong there
1237,2017-10-29T10:52:12.000014,Leif,better here than in stackoverflow :laughing:
1237,2017-10-29T10:52:20.000084,Suellen,"don't worry, we've all been there"
1237,2017-10-29T10:52:30.000076,Leif,Really? i feel really dumb
1237,2017-10-29T10:52:33.000072,Leif,hahaha
1237,2017-10-29T10:52:53.000048,Leif,"It's like ""wut? i mean i did not i see it before?"""
1237,2017-10-29T10:53:01.000061,Suellen,have you coded in PHP previously? :slightly_smiling_face:
1237,2017-10-29T10:53:38.000005,Leif,unfortunately yes ( i came from developing themes in WP )
1237,2017-10-29T10:55:31.000063,Suellen,I only asked because numbers there are sometimes strings and vice versa
1237,2017-10-29T10:56:18.000036,Suellen,So if you get used to it you can find yourself in such a headscratching situation :stuck_out_tongue:
1237,2017-10-29T10:57:38.000003,Leif,Yeah... well thanks man! i was just trying to practice some python coding on <http://www.codefights.com|www.codefights.com> and yeah i got locked up there. Thanks. Now know why is always good to let other dev to see your code
1237,2017-10-29T10:57:43.000059,Leif,:laughing:
1237,2017-10-29T10:59:13.000003,Carolin,"People, I have a structure like this: points_neiborhood = [ [""Pitimbu"",[-5.876271, -35.224500]], [""Planalto"",[-5.858102, -35.251586]],[""Ponta Negra"",[-5.877522, -35.176073]]] and in Jupyter Notebook if I do

1237,2017-10-29T11:02:03.000057,Winnifred,I think the best place to start is by dropping a snippet of your code.
1237,2017-10-29T11:11:10.000048,Carolin,"<@Cleotilde> the pair latitude and longitude or only one of theses properties? If is just latitude or longitude with don´t you order your list based in longitude or latitude and take the first or the last? If both, you have to calculate the euclidian distance of all points..."
1238,2017-10-29T11:06:10.000017,Carolin,This is what I have in my .py
1238,2017-10-29T11:06:33.000066,Winnifred,Just the lines near and around what’s throwing the `TypeError`

1238,2017-10-29T11:12:58.000037,Cleotilde,<@Carolin> Thank you for answering. I have the pair of lat and long of a location. Wanted to find the max and min.
1239,2017-10-29T11:08:44.000011,Cleotilde,HI all. I am looking for a package or script which helps us to find the max and min of a latitude and longitude.
1240,2017-10-29T11:37:13.000022,Meg,max and min of what?
1240,2017-10-29T11:37:20.000014,Meg,each of lat/long?
1240,2017-10-29T11:37:37.000047,Meg,max/min of position from equator?
1240,2017-10-29T11:37:44.000060,Meg,from prime meridian?
1240,2017-10-29T11:38:25.000071,Meg,"regardless, this is a pretty common homework question, when a student is asked to find the maximum and minimum value of a given data structure"
1240,2017-10-29T11:38:53.000061,Meg,its not hard to get a solution that executes in linear time of O(n)
1240,2017-10-29T11:39:02.000047,Meg,what have you tried?
1240,2017-10-29T11:40:22.000099,Meg,<@Carolin> `list` is a reserved word in python
1240,2017-10-29T11:40:43.000027,Meg,should be the variable name that you’ve assigned for your list
1240,2017-10-29T11:41:14.000094,Meg,"eg, `pontoA = row[0]`"
1240,2017-10-29T11:43:22.000034,Carolin,"<@Meg> thanks man, I have a structure like this: points_neighborhood = [[""Pitimbu"",[-5.876271, -35.224500]],[""Planalto"",[-5.858102, -35.251586]]]

1240,2017-10-29T11:43:54.000001,Carolin,How can I iterate through these values?
1240,2017-10-29T11:44:41.000009,Carolin,rows[0][0] does not work it returns me the first letter of the fist value
1240,2017-10-29T11:44:53.000043,Carolin,"Like 'P' in [""Pitimbu"",[-5.876271, -35.224500]]"
1240,2017-10-29T11:45:00.000053,Meg,yeah
1240,2017-10-29T11:45:00.000102,Carolin,and not -5.876271
1240,2017-10-29T11:45:14.000063,Meg,because `row[0]` is a string
1240,2017-10-29T11:45:38.000057,Meg,`row[0]` value is `‘Pitimbu’]
1240,2017-10-29T11:45:59.000106,Carolin,how I got <@Meg>
1240,2017-10-29T11:46:01.000086,Meg,`row[1][0]` would return `-5.876...`
1240,2017-10-29T11:46:01.000121,Carolin,:slightly_smiling_face:
1240,2017-10-29T11:46:35.000027,Meg,what you have to remember is you can access a character in a string by its index position
1240,2017-10-29T11:47:05.000115,Carolin,thanks dude! It worked... I guess that I was at 4am in this part KKKKKKKK omg so ashamed
1240,2017-10-29T11:47:33.000020,Carolin,thanks <@Meg>!
1240,2017-10-29T11:48:23.000034,Johana,no need to be ashamed it’s part of the learning process :wink:
1240,2017-10-29T11:48:27.000093,Johana,<@Meg> :taco:
1240,2017-10-29T11:49:29.000083,Carolin,:slightly_smiling_face:
1240,2017-10-29T12:14:12.000068,Carolin,HAHA finally it worked... omg I was at 4am trying to figure out what I was doing wrong using Uber API to simulate something like this <https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/10/uber-seems-to-offer-better-service-in-areas-with-more-white-people-that-raises-some-tough-questions/?utm_term=.b12202a9ed14> in my city
1241,2017-10-29T12:33:29.000017,Carolin,What is the equivalent unary operator of ! (not) in python? ~?
1241,2017-10-29T12:34:20.000054,Meg,`not` :slightly_smiling_face:
1241,2017-10-29T12:34:34.000003,Meg,as in `if not some_value:`
1241,2017-10-29T12:34:42.000100,Carolin,:slightly_smiling_face:
1241,2017-10-29T12:34:46.000029,Carolin,tnks
1241,2017-10-29T12:35:06.000076,Meg,"`and`, `or` and `not` are the boolean ops"
1241,2017-10-29T12:35:13.000014,Carolin,ok
1241,2017-10-29T12:35:30.000047,Meg,"took me a bit of getting used to, coming from java and JS"
1241,2017-10-29T12:36:41.000003,Carolin,haha same as me
1241,2017-10-29T12:36:57.000016,Carolin,or same as you
1241,2017-10-29T12:37:14.000048,Carolin,english is not my first language too KKK
1241,2017-10-29T12:37:25.000035,Carolin,ops... KKK = hahaha in Brazil
1241,2017-10-29T12:37:36.000035,Carolin,dont get me wrong
1241,2017-10-29T12:52:22.000056,Meg,"ah, ok.  Here in the US, it means Ku Klux Klan, which is definitely not a haha :smile:"
1241,2017-10-29T12:57:04.000005,Mallie,<@Carolin> Do you pronounce it like 'kay kay kay'?
1241,2017-10-29T13:07:26.000129,Carolin,<@Mallie> not like  that 'cause the k here is little bit different is more like ka in  kakaroto ( <https://youtu.be/w8GGm9ZzgvU?t=23s> ) but in a laugh way. If you put in youtube 'risada brasileiro kkk' you should find some results
1242,2017-10-29T12:52:30.000069,Meg,but good to know!
1242,2017-10-29T12:59:35.000013,Carolin,yeah I know but only noticed after write it
1242,2017-10-29T14:26:22.000025,Carolin,"<@Leif> is hahaha, a laugh or lol, not like in US that is Ku Klux Klan as <@Meg> talked earlier"
1242,2017-10-29T16:27:23.000035,Mallie,<@Meg> Japanese 'ka' in 'kakarot' is basically 'ca' in 'car'
1242,2017-10-29T18:36:11.000003,Mallie,Any C#/.NET users around?
1242,2017-10-29T18:39:35.000013,Rosetta,I've used it but I'm no expert
1242,2017-10-29T18:44:14.000002,Mallie,I may have found what I was looking for but basically I was just looking for any sort of standard opinion on how applications/projects should be laid out.
1242,2017-10-29T18:44:33.000066,Mallie,"I think I was using the wrong terms and not finding much, but I know found some stuff that makes sense."
1242,2017-10-29T18:44:56.000024,Mallie,"If you have a good resource to share that'd be cool, I was just lost for a few minutes of googling looking for something I thought would be pretty obvious."
1242,2017-10-29T18:48:18.000006,Johana,pluralsight has lots of .net junk. I learned visual basic in the aol 2.5 days.
1242,2017-10-29T18:57:39.000002,Rosetta,Most of what I did I read out of books a few years ago
1242,2017-10-29T18:58:14.000122,Rosetta,This probably isn't the best place to look for help regarding .Net though
1243,2017-10-29T13:58:47.000010,Leif,<@Carolin> That is an interesting fact. What does kkk stand for?
1244,2017-10-29T14:57:58.000135,Meg,"so in english, its more of a `caw` sound, than `kay`?"
1244,2017-10-29T14:59:04.000021,Carolyne,"hi guys, new to python , looking for a place to contribute ? any suggestions"
1245,2017-10-29T15:28:42.000001,Tami,Can anyone help me set up a python environment in VIM? I’ve got most of the way there ( I think ) but I’ve got a few issues and questions… (Disclaimer: I’m totally new to VIM) DM me
1245,2017-10-29T15:54:02.000108,Tami,"Nevermind, I’ve got there I think.  My only issue is that YCM doesn’t autocomplete here: `from typing import ...` I expect it to pop up and offer the import like `List, Callable etc...`. However if I do `import List \n List.[popup]` it autocompletes all of the classes inside the site package there.. So I’ve missed a configuration somewhere or it’s just not meant to work like that"
1246,2017-10-29T17:27:22.000099,Leif,how did u set up the linter and autocomplition in vim? i legit was trying to do it for a while i couldnt get it
1247,2017-10-29T23:21:57.000130,Bruno,has anyone used pthon fire for cli tools? was looking at click but this looks pretty easy too <https://github.com/google/python-fire/blob/master/docs/guide.md>
1247,2017-10-29T23:38:38.000010,Collette,"Click is much more explicit about what's going on... I don't like these examples. What I see from the guide, `fire` is full of implicit conversions to optional/required arguments, subcommands, etc."
1248,2017-10-30T00:22:17.000015,Marcie,Yeah I much prefer Click and it’s what I recommended in my Reliable Tools talk 
1248,2017-10-30T00:33:48.000015,Mirna,Kakarot is carrot
1248,2017-10-30T00:34:29.000136,Mirna,<http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Origins_of_character_names>

1248,2017-10-30T00:35:50.000018,Mirna,Maybe the author is vegetarian :))
1249,2017-10-30T06:06:01.000158,Evelin,"Hey Guys, I’m looking for ideas on how to upskill my software dev team outside of reading news and blogs etc.  We’ve been together for a while and it all works, but, looking to freshen our process / skills with outside ideas.  Thanks in advance…Will."
1249,2017-10-30T06:24:45.000101,Meg,"<@Evelin> a couple things come to mind

1. Hack day in office - each person picks something a little out of their area of expertise and tries to do something that has potential to benefit the company/ongoing projects.  
2. Host or attend a local meetup in one of the languages you work in
3. Consider Pluralsight/Udemy/Safari Online,  and other education sites as an employee perk
4. One or two conferences per year.  A different dev can go to each, and give a presentation/report when he/she comes back.  Previous position sent people to JavaOne, and they gave illuminating presentations after
5. Start being active in the dev group of the language/framework you typically work with.  eg, django developers on IRC, flask, etc"
1250,2017-10-30T06:18:06.000188,Krysta,Conferences?
1251,2017-10-30T06:31:31.000377,Mirian,+1
1251,2017-10-30T06:32:17.000407,Mirian,also we're trying to implement a process where everyone can suggest a topic that he wants to give a presentation or wants to hear about it from someone else
1251,2017-10-30T06:32:33.000228,Mirian,and those presentations would be once a month or so
1251,2017-10-30T06:33:37.000110,Meg,yes.  I suggested something similar a couple times at my office and it was done twice before the others developed a lack of interest
1251,2017-10-30T06:34:15.000019,Meg,"tough balance - does all the content come from a clique group, and the rest of the team kinda coasts along, or is it required that everyone do at least one a year?"
1251,2017-10-30T06:36:34.000179,Mirian,we won't make it required to attend
1251,2017-10-30T06:37:21.000340,Mirian,"but want to provide food, drinks etc. to encourage people to stay after working hours"
1251,2017-10-30T06:38:18.000408,Meg,"yeah, this was like a scheduled block during the day, once a month"
1251,2017-10-30T06:38:34.000102,Meg,"usually 90 minutes at 3p, and everyone could leave after"
1251,2017-10-30T06:40:31.000098,Mirian,and do you have some more conclusions why it failed?
1251,2017-10-30T06:40:37.000297,Meg,"<@Evelin> too bad you’re out of the London area, or I could point you to some people at a company I know in Guildford"
1251,2017-10-30T06:41:00.000256,Meg,"company culture, no driving force pushing standards and such."
1251,2017-10-30T06:41:27.000178,Mirian,"ok, and how big is the company?"
1251,2017-10-30T06:41:32.000120,Meg,"entire team is pretty lazy in a number of ways, and very comfortable"
1251,2017-10-30T06:41:52.000289,Meg,"5 devs total, 15 people in all"
1251,2017-10-30T06:41:58.000027,Meg,so a pretty small one
1251,2017-10-30T06:42:29.000074,Toby,hello
1251,2017-10-30T06:42:32.000026,Meg,"its a type of environment that I think fosters stagnation, in a number of ways"
1251,2017-10-30T06:42:47.000355,Mirian,"oh, we're a small one too, but some kind of software agency, so about 15 developers, 2 QA and CEO"
1251,2017-10-30T06:42:53.000430,Meg,"fortunately, I’m isolated from about 95% of that"
1251,2017-10-30T06:43:47.000279,Mirian,but looking for ways to scale and stay competetive against bigger and more well-known companies
1251,2017-10-30T06:44:18.000222,Meg,"part of the problem is the entire company started as a print publishing company, and moved to tech.  the owner was a subject matter expert originally, but is certainly not now nor ever when it comes to tech.  but she insists on having the kind of control over decisions as if she were.  Combined with the fact there is _no_ leadership at all, and its not suprising"
1251,2017-10-30T06:44:39.000077,Meg,"its pretty well known that we need some sort of project manager involved, but no way will a hire ever happen for that"
1251,2017-10-30T06:46:30.000014,Mirian,"that's not good I guess, maybe one of you can go into  management"
1251,2017-10-30T06:48:10.000066,Toby,is tkinter a good library to use when starting with gui's?
1251,2017-10-30T06:48:49.000060,Meg,"Maybe eventually, but certainly not at this place "
1251,2017-10-30T06:49:47.000239,Ciera,I played a bit with it and it was ok. Your gui's won't be beautiful but it should be a good start
1251,2017-10-30T06:50:07.000420,Meg,I'd say they've lost about 8M USD in about 9 years or so due lost sales and turnover as well as a huge mountain of technical debt that is making feature development move like molasses 
1251,2017-10-30T06:50:10.000307,Emily,yes its
1251,2017-10-30T06:50:22.000225,Emily,true !!
1251,2017-10-30T06:50:33.000205,Emily,you can try QT
1251,2017-10-30T06:50:44.000049,Meg,"Hell, git branching is black magic to some of them."
1251,2017-10-30T06:50:57.000178,Toby,"thanks, so if its a good base/starting point, what would be a ""beautiful gui""? id like it to remain free though"
1251,2017-10-30T06:52:37.000012,Emily,i guess PyQt
1251,2017-10-30T06:52:48.000135,Toby,i thought pyqt was paid?
1251,2017-10-30T06:52:58.000029,Emily,WxPython
1251,2017-10-30T06:53:06.000194,Emily,open source
1251,2017-10-30T06:53:15.000019,Toby,must have misread it
1251,2017-10-30T06:53:54.000439,Emily,PyGTK
1251,2017-10-30T06:53:58.000239,Toby,"<https://insights.dice.com/2017/08/07/7-top-python-gui-frameworks-for-2017-2/>
```Conclusion
This is a great set of frameworks that should cover most needs. All except PyQt are completely free.```"
1251,2017-10-30T06:54:18.000456,Emily,GTK is for GNome environment
1251,2017-10-30T06:54:33.000051,Ciera,There is some restriction on QT if you sell your product I believe
1251,2017-10-30T06:54:51.000306,Toby,"ah ok, so free for dev but paid for distribution? that sorta thing?"
1251,2017-10-30T06:55:14.000230,Ciera,"```The Qt open source licensing is ideal for use cases such as open source projects with open source distribution, student/academic purposes, hobby projects, internal research projects without external distribution, or other projects where all (L)GPL obligations can be met.```"
1251,2017-10-30T06:55:25.000213,Toby,"ah ok, thanks"
1251,2017-10-30T06:55:30.000170,Ciera,```The commercial Qt license gives you the full rights to create and distribute software on your own terms without any open source license obligations.```
1251,2017-10-30T06:56:15.000097,Emily,Do u mind if i ask about you ??
1251,2017-10-30T06:56:44.000134,Toby,in what way?
1251,2017-10-30T06:57:14.000070,Emily,tell me about you !
1251,2017-10-30T06:59:52.000386,Mirian,so maybe those presentations should bring topics like git workflow and its' benefits?
1251,2017-10-30T07:02:00.000232,Vada,This is a weird conversation with all the quoting
1251,2017-10-30T07:03:11.000187,Vada,There is no need to share every message as you respond. you can just respond - it's actually easier to follow that way
1251,2017-10-30T07:03:12.000104,Collette,Especially after Kevin Spacey's coming-out...
1251,2017-10-30T07:03:57.000011,Collette,"By the ways, there are <#C07EFN21K|random> and <#C07EHQYFN|introductions> which are more suitable for such personal discussions."
1251,2017-10-30T07:04:00.000013,Vada,<@Collette> I am both surprised by the news and confused as to the relevance
1251,2017-10-30T07:04:02.000154,Collette,"Or, even, personal messages."
1251,2017-10-30T07:06:36.000122,Vada,"<@Emily> it is inappropriate to ask someone to talk about themselves in such a public forum. It's not exactly appropriate to ask in a private chat either, but it would be a better place than here. <@Toby> should also have no obligation to respond as well.

This is not a complaint, or necessarily a violation of any rules - more of a cultural custom you should be aware of in an English speaking forum."
1251,2017-10-30T07:07:36.000274,Emily,Sorry sir !
1251,2017-10-30T07:07:59.000399,Emily,i should have asked this question at <#C07EHQYFN|introductions>
1251,2017-10-30T07:09:36.000135,Vada,yes <@Toby> feel free to introduce yourself to the group in <#C07EHQYFN|introductions>
1251,2017-10-30T07:10:13.000050,Emily,got messed up with group! <@Vada> sir
1251,2017-10-30T07:10:28.000118,Emily,okay
1252,2017-10-30T06:45:31.000011,Emily,hello?
1252,2017-10-30T07:09:22.000025,Vada,Ah right now I see why you asked
1252,2017-10-30T07:10:18.000211,Vada,no worries
1253,2017-10-30T11:50:34.000449,Margrett,"Should I be using list comprehension to `assert` that all members of a list parameter in my function are of a required custom class, or is there a cleaner way of doing it?"
1253,2017-10-30T11:51:43.000089,Margrett,"I tend to do a lot of `assert isinstance(param1, CustomClass)`"
1253,2017-10-30T11:53:11.000038,Lory,a list comprehension sounds like the best way to do it based on my experiences
1253,2017-10-30T11:53:22.000728,Lory,unless there's a way to just do the entire list in one go which I am not aware of personally
1253,2017-10-30T11:53:44.000620,Margrett,"Yah, I didn't see some hidden functionality in isinstance, at least from the official docs"
1253,2017-10-30T11:54:00.000800,Scot,But you won't be using the resulting list anyway... Why not just `for param in params: assert(....)`?
1253,2017-10-30T11:54:45.000556,Lory,you could have your class self validate before being appended to the list or something too. depends on your code structure but the various approaches all do the same thing at the end of the day
1253,2017-10-30T11:54:54.000209,Margrett,"I probably should just use a normal for loop, that way I can complain about the specific non-conforming item."
1253,2017-10-30T11:55:39.000284,Margrett,"In my current code, I'm just talking to myself, but this is very similar to a another one of my projects where I expect random  non-python proficient people to be using my classes"
1253,2017-10-30T11:55:54.000216,Margrett,Figured I should try to be consistent in my approach :slightly_smiling_face:
1253,2017-10-30T11:58:42.000401,Scot,I personally wouldn't use a list comprehension if I didn't intend to use the resulting list for anything
1253,2017-10-30T11:58:43.000464,Junita,"could also do a test in the list comprehension, and use `any` and `all` type checks"
1253,2017-10-30T12:01:26.000348,Ciera,```Should I be using list comprehension to `assert` that all members of a list parameter in my function are of a required custom class``` Should you really do that and not let it fails later on ?
1253,2017-10-30T12:03:14.000854,Margrett,"My general philosophy is to fail fast.  In this tool, if a user provides me with wacky input data, it could be devastating to the downstream systems that I'm re-configuring."
1253,2017-10-30T12:04:12.000707,Margrett,"I do like the potential idea of using any/all, need to play with that.  Could make the code more readable"
1253,2017-10-30T12:05:04.000755,Junita,yeah I use that sometimes and like it.  the inline assert seems nice too as well
1253,2017-10-30T12:11:29.000449,Margrett,"A simplified example:
```my_ints = [1,2,3]
assert all(isinstance(i, int) for i in my_ints), 'my_ints must all be integers'```"
1253,2017-10-30T12:12:44.000542,Margrett,Seems to meet the test of being self-documenting
1253,2017-10-30T12:19:55.000391,Margrett,"Thanks <@Junita>, <@Truman>, <@Scot>,<@Ciera> Thanks for the help with the assert list question :taco:"

1255,2017-10-30T16:03:26.000615,Kiersten,"<@Meg> That's a really great list of things :taco: 

<@Evelin> We did a rotating presentation at work on a dev focused topic, that helped a bit to open up discussion towards newer ways of doing things. We also had a couple hours a week dedicating to do ""learning"" but it worked better when there was a discussion about what that was and what the goals were, honestly most devs didn't even use it :disappointed:
Meetups is not something you can force but it's definitely helped me to upskill a lot.

Looking back, the times that our team/tech did move up was when one person was assigned the responsibility to implement a new process and spent the time actually implementing it, then doing a presentation on it so that the others know what's going on and how to work with it now that it's there."
1256,2017-10-30T16:30:49.000217,Elanor,"Hi Guys , I have a json Que and I want to check for some value ordering , what is the fastest way to do that?
{ First Property : true , Second Property:false} I want to be sure that the First Property showed in this que before the Second Property"
1256,2017-10-30T16:42:50.000589,Lory,Do you know what the order is prior to run time or is it dynamic?
1256,2017-10-30T16:43:03.000246,Meg,sounds like you need to make a priority queue
1256,2017-10-30T16:45:56.000015,Elanor,"actually all I have is dictionary with some json objects in it ,I want to know how can I check if one of those objects come before another one or not"
1256,2017-10-30T16:47:10.000440,Rosetta,Dictionaries are unordered by default
1256,2017-10-30T16:47:24.000420,Elanor,yes you are right
1256,2017-10-30T16:47:55.000092,Elanor,"that's why is not that easy to do that , my dictionary is specific dictionary which the order is important to me"
1256,2017-10-30T16:47:59.000138,Lory,Lists are ordered so that's reliable but only helps if you know what you're looking for. I've never used priority ques so I'm not sure how they work personally
1256,2017-10-30T16:48:13.000696,Antionette,You could try using an ordereddict
1256,2017-10-30T16:48:15.000549,Antionette,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict>
1256,2017-10-30T16:48:26.000370,Elanor,let me check thnx
1256,2017-10-30T16:49:55.000361,Elanor,I don't thinks that's will work <@Antionette>
1256,2017-10-30T16:51:22.000330,Keesha,<@Elanor> are you looking to sort your dictionary by key or value?
1256,2017-10-30T16:51:26.000250,Meg,ordered dicts only work with insertion order
1256,2017-10-30T16:51:48.000174,Meg,sounds like you need to write a list comp to output your dict to a list based on the key value
1256,2017-10-30T17:12:24.000419,Seema,"I thought 3.6 had order in order out for dicts, now I have to go check..."
1256,2017-10-30T17:12:52.000268,Meghan,"3.6 does have dicts that are ordered by default. However, they aren't promised to be in future versions."
1256,2017-10-30T17:13:15.000470,Seema,"totally understand that, and he may not be able to 3.6 for a variety of reasons"
1256,2017-10-30T17:13:31.000029,Elanor,I;m using 2.7
1256,2017-10-30T17:14:11.000545,Seema,"and when you say they are ordered, are they ordered by a key or a value or are you thinking that they're are indexed?"
1256,2017-10-30T17:15:17.000421,Meghan,"They are ordered in the way they were created, not based on any other logic."
1256,2017-10-30T17:16:28.000192,Seema,<@Elanor> what is it about OrderedDict that think won't work?
1256,2017-10-30T17:17:44.000098,Seema,and is the creation of the dictionary a one-time thing?
1256,2017-10-30T17:19:50.000161,Elanor,my dict's value is another dictionary
1256,2017-10-30T17:32:13.000244,Elanor,"I think I solved this problem , because I have enabled the timpestamp"
1256,2017-10-30T17:32:36.000128,Elanor,"and then I dont need to have the dictionary ordered or not , since it will come with timestamp"
1257,2017-10-30T17:30:09.000030,Lory,conceptually it doesn't change the problem of ordering if it is nested or not
1257,2017-10-30T17:52:14.000196,Lory,Yeah there's an easy method there
1258,2017-10-30T18:27:56.000147,Daysi,"Hi, I recently was asked to work on a django project and I’m having a little difficulty getting the app set up locally.  Python 3.6 and django 1.11.  I created the database and went to run the migration files, but I get an error saying “relation table_name does not exist”.  That table should be created by the first migration file based on what I can tell.  I’m not sure why it would be complaining about a table not existing when there are no tables at all (brand new db).  Should I be deleting the migration files and running makemigrations?  That doesn’t seem to make much sense, but not sure at this point. I’m a rails and phoenix developer, this is my first time with django.  Any help or suggestions would be awesome!"
1258,2017-10-30T18:30:37.000123,Rosetta,You should probably run your own. Who knows what state the DB was in when those first migrations were generated
1258,2017-10-30T18:31:00.000047,Rosetta,It sounds like you're missing some or the tables/database were created outside of Django
1258,2017-10-30T18:31:33.000220,Daysi,should I delete the migrations folder and run makemigrations?
1258,2017-10-30T18:32:43.000266,Cammy,Yes..
1258,2017-10-30T18:33:03.000466,Cammy,an make sure you have the database existing
1258,2017-10-30T18:33:34.000261,Cammy,makemigrations and migrate..
1258,2017-10-30T18:35:24.000419,Daysi,"the database exists, so I deleted the migrations folder and ran makemigrations, I got the same error as before.  ‘’'psycopg2.ProgrammingError: relation “proposals_proposal” does not exist

1258,2017-10-30T18:59:59.000162,Rosetta,Which migration file is throwing the error?
1258,2017-10-30T19:05:11.000099,Daysi,"Well, there isn’t any migration files now, I deleted the entire directory.  So in theory, it shouldn’t be throwing an error at all on a migration file."
1258,2017-10-30T19:06:01.000031,Daysi,"but prior to deleting the directory, I ran the very first migration file 0001_initial.py and it produced the same error."

1260,2017-10-31T00:14:42.000044,Bruno,good evening
1260,2017-10-31T00:15:32.000112,Ricki,<@Bruno> i would love some help if you don't mind me asking
1260,2017-10-31T00:15:50.000123,Vena,@Furkanzmc thank you
1260,2017-10-31T00:16:39.000033,Ricki,i'm currently sudying on team treehouse right know and i'm stuck on a question
1260,2017-10-31T00:16:51.000048,Bruno,"<@Ricki> idk if i will be able to, but its an open forum. just ask and if someone knows and can help they probably will"
1260,2017-10-31T00:17:16.000003,Ricki,any advice anyone?
1260,2017-10-31T00:17:42.000079,Bruno,what is your problem
1260,2017-10-31T00:17:57.000011,Ricki,its saying i made a mistake
1260,2017-10-31T00:18:27.000158,Bruno,check where your quotes are
1260,2017-10-31T00:18:49.000122,Bruno,`.format()` is a function that operates on a string
1260,2017-10-31T00:20:17.000105,Ricki,"it says that i don't have to print() anything to pass the quiz, so how do i use the .format() in my variable?"
1260,2017-10-31T00:21:19.000180,Ricki,i understand how to use it in print()
1260,2017-10-31T00:21:20.000062,Bruno,"when in a terminal like that, you dont need to use print as whatever the result is, it will output to the console."
1260,2017-10-31T00:21:32.000029,Ricki,oh
1260,2017-10-31T00:21:53.000052,Bruno,"so, look at the format, on how you use string.format(), then compare to how you are using format. there is a syntax error in your code."
1260,2017-10-31T00:21:57.000077,Bruno,one of the last few lines
1260,2017-10-31T00:22:42.000109,Bruno,look at the last line and what is spit out. it means that the line before it is one whole string
1260,2017-10-31T00:25:06.000007,Bruno,did you find it <@Ricki>?
1260,2017-10-31T00:26:12.000043,Ricki,checking it out now <@Bruno>
1260,2017-10-31T00:35:25.000048,Ricki,man.. i still don't get it <@Bruno> i sware i'm going to go bald :grimacing:
1260,2017-10-31T00:36:07.000015,Bruno,lol its ok
1260,2017-10-31T00:36:40.000041,Bruno,"so the syntax of format is `""some string {name}"".format(name)`"
1260,2017-10-31T00:36:48.000062,Bruno,check your quoting

1260,2017-10-31T00:44:55.000159,Bruno,thats the line with the error

1260,2017-10-31T00:45:09.000156,Ricki,yes
1260,2017-10-31T00:45:13.000168,Bruno,you moved the last double quote
1260,2017-10-31T00:45:24.000103,Ricki,i just updated it to what you typed
1260,2017-10-31T00:45:39.000104,Bruno,that should work. `subject` should now spit out the proper text
1260,2017-10-31T00:45:48.000112,Bruno,you had the last double quote at the end
1260,2017-10-31T00:46:59.000197,Bruno,do you see what the error was? is it working for you now?
1260,2017-10-31T00:49:28.000057,Ricki,"i see, my errors was, but this thing still won't let me pass.. :face_with_rolling_eyes:"
1260,2017-10-31T00:50:46.000095,Bruno,might need a space between `loves` and `{}` ?

1260,2017-10-31T01:02:05.000042,Winnifred,what is the latest stable version of 3.4?
1260,2017-10-31T01:02:49.000071,Bruno,locally pyenv tells me it is `3.4.6`
1260,2017-10-31T01:02:54.000105,Bruno,<@Winnifred>
1260,2017-10-31T01:03:14.000149,Winnifred,"Ah, thanks <@Bruno>!"
1260,2017-10-31T01:03:26.000019,Winnifred,I need to learn that command. I r `pyenv` n00b.
1260,2017-10-31T01:03:26.000134,Bruno,Si
1260,2017-10-31T01:03:41.000057,Bruno,just check out the pyenv library
1260,2017-10-31T01:04:00.000143,Bruno,i dont use it to manage my virtual envs. i just use it to install python versions.
1260,2017-10-31T01:04:04.000070,Bruno,i use pipenv
1260,2017-10-31T01:04:37.000029,Winnifred,"gotcha, what are your thoughts about installing virtualenv on each version and creating them that way?"
1260,2017-10-31T01:04:52.000157,Bruno,what do you mean?
1260,2017-10-31T01:05:08.000083,Bruno,create a venv for each version of python?
1260,2017-10-31T01:05:33.000058,Winnifred,"well, installing a venv manager on each version"
1260,2017-10-31T01:05:34.000163,Bruno,i just create them as I need them
1260,2017-10-31T01:05:39.000107,Bruno,nah.
1260,2017-10-31T01:06:36.000081,Bruno,if you install pyenv you can use that to manage installation of whole python versions. then i just use pipenv to manage my environemnts. which uses `pew` under the hood. so i use that to create the actual env.
1260,2017-10-31T01:07:08.000131,Winnifred,"ah, okay"
1260,2017-10-31T01:08:34.000143,Bruno,"so my workflow:
```
pipenv install 3.4.6
pew new --py ~/.pyenv/versions/3.4.6/bin/python my_env_name
# this will auto activate the environment
```
then if i want to activate that env later i just do ```pew workon my_env_name``` and `exit` to leave the environment"
1260,2017-10-31T01:10:13.000097,Bruno,"or, you can run a command from within that environment without activating it, just `cd` into the project with a `Pipfile` and you can run `pipenv run -- flask run` to run flask, for example"
1260,2017-10-31T01:10:30.000092,Bruno,but i find it easier to just activate the env
1260,2017-10-31T01:14:17.000081,Winnifred,"Nice, I'll have to check out `pipenv`."
1261,2017-10-31T04:11:21.000306,Gwenda,"Hey Everyone ! Quick (meta) questions for you guys. I wasn't sure what channel post them so here goes: I recently had my ""aha"" moment with regards to multithreading and I was wondering if it it's relevant to use such an approach in the context of web scraping (if you have a ton of sites to extract data from) or in the context of database interaction (say you have a csv and you want to insert each row as a row in a given DB) is there any benefit to that ? What's your experience ?"
1261,2017-10-31T04:13:21.000188,Gwenda,"Also, if the main reason for multithreading is to speed things up then why do we use locks (don't they defeat the purpose if other threads have to wait for locks to be released before proceeding ?) Thanks in advance for your clarifications"
1261,2017-10-31T04:15:02.000073,Collette,"<@Gwenda> because threads can share the same memory. If two or more threads try to modify a list, for example, you can't predict the exact order of modifications. Thus you need a lock to make sure such mutable shared memory can be modified by a single thread at a time."
1261,2017-10-31T04:15:34.000042,Collette,"If you don't share any memory, then you don't need any locks. But in that case you actually don't need threads - you need multiple processes"
1261,2017-10-31T04:16:32.000163,Gwenda,ah very interesting point !
1261,2017-10-31T04:17:00.000127,Gwenda,so if memory access is not an issue then multiprocessing is more suited ?
1261,2017-10-31T04:17:25.000301,Collette,"It really depends on your actual use-case, but in general - yes."
1261,2017-10-31T04:18:07.000234,Collette,"The whole point of having multiple threads is to avoid expensive communication between isolated memories, by having a shared memory."
1261,2017-10-31T04:19:02.000003,Gwenda,ah I see now ! Makes sense
1261,2017-10-31T04:19:11.000039,Gwenda,thanks <@Collette>!
1262,2017-10-31T04:44:49.000060,Mafalda,I am looking to plot time series data for multiple data values together any leads to do so in python?
1263,2017-10-31T06:05:16.000196,Jamar,"Morning, Just wondered if any has any experience with a good method to cleanly terminate all threads with Ctrl C on a script using multiprocess pool map?"
1263,2017-10-31T06:06:45.000135,Vada,isn't ctrl c the same as the kkill signal?
1263,2017-10-31T06:06:59.000099,Vada,If you have the thread ids you can just send a kill signal for each id
1263,2017-10-31T06:07:03.000252,Vada,via bash
1263,2017-10-31T06:09:02.000164,Jamar,havent done a whole lot with Multiprocessing with python I have tried the normal try except with KeyboardInterrupt: but it just kills the current thread I assume
1263,2017-10-31T06:09:07.000043,Jamar,as it just continues

1264,2017-10-31T09:29:37.000174,Collette,`=&gt;` is simply for showing you what have been returned from the script

1265,2017-10-31T10:12:24.000197,Ciera,very much :point_up:
1265,2017-10-31T10:15:02.000534,Lory,I initially had taken that route but the data I am pulling dates out of comes form a few different sources as strings. I figured the date time approach would work in a more predictable environment rather than here where I am conditionally modifying specific pieces and at times reusing the same data for new results. It get's converted after this function returns when I am ready to do my db inserts
1265,2017-10-31T10:16:11.000196,Lory,would you have a suggestion as to how to constructively build a date with arbitrary y/m/d information using the date time method? I am not too familiar with how to use it correctly so I may have had a bad implementation
1265,2017-10-31T10:19:04.000490,Collette,<@Lory> sounds like a job for <http://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html>
1265,2017-10-31T10:19:05.000066,Ciera,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime>
1265,2017-10-31T10:19:38.000342,Collette,"`strptime` is good when you have a fixed known format, `dateutil` is good when you just need to parse damn dates :slightly_smiling_face:"
1265,2017-10-31T10:21:05.000369,Ciera,"yep. with only a few different format I'm not sure which one is the best, but idk how many different format mike expect"
1265,2017-10-31T10:25:14.000221,Lory,"I'll look deeper into that aspect. However, ignoring the dates and looking at the if/else structure I have set up, is there any other way to construct it such that I don't need 2 areas in which I check the status of `has_day` or is that inherently impossible because I need to first check the length of the date I have?"
1265,2017-10-31T10:26:16.000545,Lory,"and all formats end up being `yymmdd` it's just a matter of what does it have currently, what is it expected to have and then any missing information is appended if needed, aka the day information which defaults to `01`"
1265,2017-10-31T10:27:07.000154,Ciera,on the top of my head I don't have any idea to check both condition
1265,2017-10-31T10:29:53.000362,Lory,Fair enough. I have a tendency to look too much into optimization lol. I'm going to dive into those date formats and see how that goes
1265,2017-10-31T10:30:33.000261,Ciera,well you could do a function but if the check is only a line or two long it's not necessary
1265,2017-10-31T10:31:06.000519,Lory,"Exactly what I was thinking, it would just take from the readability of the code"
1265,2017-10-31T10:31:21.000363,Ciera,depending on the conditions sometime having a 4 branch if/elif might be more readable but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1265,2017-10-31T10:33:10.000773,Lory,lol thanks. I'll just let it be for now and maybe I'll have an epiphany one day
1266,2017-10-31T11:13:22.000044,Virgen,"Quick question... What does the line ""Global E"" (Line 6) do in the following code snippet?"
1266,2017-10-31T11:14:26.000584,Lory,"as I recently found out, that allows you to create mutable global variables"
1266,2017-10-31T11:15:05.000384,Meghan,"It doesn't create them, it says the global is mutable from within this function."
1266,2017-10-31T11:15:09.000384,Vada,Well in that one it is in a comment
1266,2017-10-31T11:15:17.000447,Vada,so it doesn't do anything
1266,2017-10-31T11:15:20.000882,Lory,Which is something you generally want to avoid doing in a production level piece of software. I personally cheat when writing test scripts to work out a specific function
1266,2017-10-31T11:15:35.000351,Virgen,correct. commented or not makes no difference when I run the snippet.
1266,2017-10-31T11:15:36.000357,Meghan,They are probably indicating they are using the global E.
1266,2017-10-31T11:15:47.000375,Vada,<@Meghan> E has not been created beforehand so does get created there.
1266,2017-10-31T11:15:54.000746,Meghan,"And yes, there is rarely a reason for it."
1266,2017-10-31T11:16:02.000353,Vada,actually you are right sorry
1266,2017-10-31T11:16:18.000171,Vada,it gets declared later - this is just the person saying it is the global E
1266,2017-10-31T11:16:22.000599,Collette,"<@Virgen> without `global foo`, `foo = something` creates a local variable `foo` instead of modifying the global one"

1266,2017-10-31T11:20:05.000618,Virgen,"I think I understand. So, if I were to expand on this initial snippet and wanted to use ""E"" later on, outside of the function, I would need to use the ""Global E"" to change the Global variable."
1266,2017-10-31T11:20:27.000175,Virgen,"without the ""Global E"", the value of E would be unchanged outside of the function."
1266,2017-10-31T11:20:29.000097,Virgen,correct?
1266,2017-10-31T11:21:27.000498,Lory,"If you wanted to modify it in some way yes, otherwise if it is simply a reference variable like a file path or something that you do not plan on modifying, then you do not need `global`"
1266,2017-10-31T11:22:04.000362,Lory,"you only need `global VARIABLE` when you plan on modifying that data structure, which as everyone says, shouldn't really be done"
1266,2017-10-31T11:23:36.000674,Virgen,"In that snippet, in that function. Is ""E"" getting modified? Or is it being used to assign the users input to ""string""?"
1266,2017-10-31T11:23:47.000123,Vada,here is a good SO post on it.
1266,2017-10-31T11:23:47.000465,Vada,<https://stackoverflow.com/a/4693385>
1266,2017-10-31T11:23:52.000972,Virgen,"in which case, ""string"" is what would hold that data that would get used later."
1266,2017-10-31T11:23:59.000379,Vada,"And in the code given, E is not modified"
1266,2017-10-31T11:24:16.000043,Vada,it is assigning the users input to `string`
1266,2017-10-31T11:24:24.000004,Lory,it isn't it is simply being referenced and saved in the variable `string` which is local to that function and therefore mutable
1266,2017-10-31T11:24:41.000315,Virgen,"so even more of a reason that ""Global E"" is unnecessary."
1266,2017-10-31T11:24:42.000549,Vada,mutability is a different thing....
1266,2017-10-31T11:24:43.000322,Virgen,?
1266,2017-10-31T11:24:50.000732,Vada,yep

1266,2017-10-31T11:28:15.000396,Virgen,<@Lory> how did you format the snippets in your posts?
1266,2017-10-31T11:29:27.000571,Lory,"and <@Vada> is correct I didn't mean mutable, just that it is local and you can assign new data to that variable. mutability has to do with 'identity'  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8056130/immutable-vs-mutable-types>

and how do you mean <@Virgen>, your formatted code looks the same as mine as far as I can tell"

1266,2017-10-31T11:53:38.000931,Virgen,<@Lory> I meant the small bits within your replies. `like this`. which I have now figured out is back ticks. thanks <@Meg>

1272,2017-11-01T07:19:20.000105,Caitlyn,"hello community! :slightly_smiling_face: 
my ideas are currently blocked by the following problem:

*context:* i’m trying to build a simple (read-only) python api client for a storage product, but as I’m lazy I’m trying to do things dynamically… 
*problem*: the api server has endpoints like this:
```
GET: /monitor/host?nodeId=xxx[&amp;region=xxx]
GET: /monitor/nodelist?[region=xxx]
GET: /system/version
GET: /usage
```
my idea was to create classes for each endpoint (monitor, system, usage, etc), and get the “child-endpoint” (/monitor/*host* or /monitor/*nodelist*, etc) dynamically… but then, I would still need to get all URL the parameters (*nodeId*, *region*, etc)… the usage I have in mind is something like this:
```
client = WhateverStorageApi()
client.monitor.host(hostId='node01', region='eu-west-1') # this would generate: /monitor/host?nodeId=node01&amp;region=eu-west-1
```
my problem is: __getattr__ isn’t aware of any **kwargs, and __call__ only works for whenever I call a class.. is there any other well-known way of achieving this? so far I came up with:
```
class Monitor(object):

    base_url = 'monitor'
    
    def __getattr__(self, endpoint, **kwargs):
        
        base_call = '/{base_url}/{endpoint}'.format(
            base_url=Monitor.base_url,
            endpoint=endpoint
        )
    
        if 'nodeId' in kwargs.keys():
            base_call += '?nodeId={node_id}'.format(
                node_id=kwargs['nodeId']
            )
    
        if 'region' in kwargs.keys():
            base_call += '?region={region}'.format(
                region=kwargs['region']
            )
    
        # do something with base_call
``` 
(which I know… it simply doesn’t work)"

1284,2017-11-01T19:09:35.000105,Kenny,"Hey folks. Take a look at this project: <https://github.com/datamade/census/blob/master/census/core.py>. I’m thinking about ways to make it more intuitive based on what it’s trying to model. For example, `acs5` and `acs5dp` are two different methods of `Census()`. But the class associated with `acs5` (`ACS5Client()`) is really where the meat of the method is, and the `ACS5DpClient()` class is just two variables that replace variables of `ACS5Client()`. Further, what I’m thinking would make more sense based on how the API is organized (see: <https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html>) is if there were `acs5.detail`, `acs5.dataprofile`, `acs5.subject`, and `acs5.comparison` attached to `Census.acs5`. How would I go about reorganizing this code to make that happen? I’m thinking it has something to do with adding those methods to the `ACS5Client()` class, but… *TL;DR:* I don’t grok how these classes fit together, or really classes in general."
1285,2017-11-01T20:05:19.000179,Angelina,Having a hard time getting the hang of unittest.mock to mock an object ensuring the mock has the same API as the object.
1285,2017-11-01T20:06:14.000341,Angelina,"example object that's slow to create and gets passed around an application:
```class Foo:
    def __init__(self, one, two, three):
        delay = 8
        time.sleep(delay)
        self.one = one
        self.two = two
        self.three = three
        self.logic = True```"
1285,2017-11-01T20:07:48.000151,Angelina,"Trying to test a function that takes that object as an argument
```def list_foo(foo):
    return [foo.one, foo.two, foo.three]```"
1285,2017-11-01T20:08:37.000157,Angelina,"this passes:
```class FooTests(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_list_foo(self):
        expected_list = [1, 2, 3]
        mock_foo = mock.create_autospec(spec=Foo, instance=True,
                                        one=1, two=2, three=3,)
        foo_list = list_foo(mock_foo)
        self.assertEqual(expected_list, foo_list```"
1285,2017-11-01T20:09:31.000199,Angelina,"but so does this:
```    def test_list_foo(self):
        expected_list = [1, 2, 3]
        mock_foo = mock.create_autospec(spec=Foo, instance=True,
                                        one=1, two=2, three=3, four=4)

1285,2017-11-01T20:10:21.000123,Angelina,and the 'four=4' parameter isn't part of the Foo object.

1289,2017-11-02T09:40:49.000372,Toby,can someone please help with kivy? im struggling with the rules
1289,2017-11-02T09:42:04.000121,Harlan,There’s a <#C07FJKDNH|kivy> channel in this team. I bet you could get a hand from someone there.
1289,2017-11-02T09:43:54.000767,Harlan,<@Kenny> It looks like the “Dp” could be done away with completely by just initializing the ACS{n}Client classes with the variables that the Dp classes supply.
1289,2017-11-02T09:45:01.000599,Harlan,Honestly there are a few things about that library that could be improved.
1289,2017-11-02T09:49:59.000473,Toby,nobody seems to be active in that channel tho
1289,2017-11-02T09:53:46.000401,Harlan,"<@Kenny> 
The first would probably to be break those classes out into more than one file called `core.py`. With a name like core it makes me think that they were going to add more files/break up the core file but then just didn’t.
The second would be all of the cryptic class names. I guess if you know the field/datasets they make sense, but they don’t to me. The names themselves would be fine, but they don’t have a single doc string in the whole file.
My other nitpick is the gratuitous use of whitespace. That’s just a style preference I have, but they have dozens of blank lines all over the place and I find it distracting and think it makes it harder to read."
1289,2017-11-02T09:54:14.000707,Meg,"<@Toby> then unfortunately, you might have to look elsewhere for kivy help."
1289,2017-11-02T09:54:21.000440,Harlan,"<@Toby> I just noticed that I was the second person to recommend you look in the kivy channel, and that you already did."
1289,2017-11-02T09:55:14.000798,Toby,i asked a question in that channel yesterday and nobody has messaged in it since
1289,2017-11-02T09:56:24.000736,Meg,"yeah, its definitely a low-activity channel"
1289,2017-11-02T09:57:23.000871,Toby,yeah... and google doesnt help much
1289,2017-11-02T09:57:31.000268,Meg,which suggests there are not many people in this community with knowledge and familarity
1289,2017-11-02T09:57:55.000637,Meg,"so, even if you keep asking here, I doubt you’re going to get any kind of meaningful response"
1289,2017-11-02T09:58:11.000782,Toby,true..
1289,2017-11-02T09:58:12.000032,Meg,have you checked out the google group/mailing list for that project?
1289,2017-11-02T09:58:35.000524,Toby,ive looked in a couple of groups when googling it but nothing besides that

1289,2017-11-02T09:58:53.000343,Harlan,"I don’t think I can help with kivy. I can suggest an alternative though. There’s a guy working on a group of projects called beeware. Of particular interest to you might be VOC <https://pybee.org/project/projects/bridges/voc/>.

1290,2017-11-02T11:28:24.000398,Kenny,"<@Harlan> haha agreed, but since I'm not deeply involved with this project, I was looking to just tackle some of the low hanging fruit rather than reorganize the whole thing. The class names do kind of make sense based on what its modeling, but yeah more comments would be nice."

1292,2017-11-02T12:29:31.000046,Johana,Django and Flask views are python at the end of the day so you can execute whatever tasks you need.
1292,2017-11-02T12:30:50.000548,Blanche,"Perfect, any preference (and reason) that you would go with one over the other in this situation?"
1292,2017-11-02T12:31:58.000404,Johana,"my standard answer:

```
flask is really nice especially if you like sqlalchemy. it's one of the reasons i still build many things in flask. i think flask has some things that make it really easy to get started at the beginning but can also mislead you as well. flask is a microframework so it has to be built up in pieces (called extensions) and has a lot of flexibility. this flexibility can start to become an issue when your application grows and you get errors about circular imports. a good tip to start out with when building flask web applications is to be aware that there are two very important patterns when structuring your app: 
a) application factory
b) blueprints
a good project structure at the beginning doesn't hurt!

Django is an entire framework and has opinions of its own. Django has opinions on what template language and database orm you should use. Django will provide you with all the tools. It is possible to change template languages from Django to Jinja2. The biggest plus about Django is it's the most sought after developer position in the python web world. Django gives you everything you need in one place. That's the nice thing about Django is it has made a lot of decisions for you. This enforced structure allows you to be focused and very proficient. The Django Rest Framework is legendary in the Python world and makes it fun to build Rest apis and you also get a professional looking browsable api with it. When you work with Django you know it's a professional framework. That's why they say it's for, ""perfectionists with deadlines.""

It can never hurt to learn Django or any python web framework. There are a lot of the patterns that remain the same like MVC and these sorts of things.

One of the first times i entered the #pocoo channel on irc i saw a conversation between armin ronacher, the creator of flask, and someone else. armin said something that i can't forget. He said, ""flask will not make or break your project."" Both Django and Flask have excellent documentation and will appeal to different people. Why not try both?

Django and Flask are two web frameworks that help you solve problems in different ways. If you are new to python i recommend flask bc i think it gets you a lot for your milage at the beginning and once you get the hang of building applications moving on to Django or Pyramid is not an issue. The concepts you learn building a wsgi web application transfer to other wsgi applications. (edited)

1292,2017-11-02T12:36:36.000272,Blanche,"Excellent answer, thank you"
1292,2017-11-02T12:38:46.000864,Johana,it’s probably one of more light handed flask vs django responses you’ll get.
1292,2017-11-02T12:41:26.000729,Blanche,"I have zero experience with either, so it's great. I'll start with flask, no harm eventually learning both"
1292,2017-11-02T12:42:47.000692,Johana,i’m mainly a flask dev but that wouldn’t stop me for applying for a django job. there may be some large gaps in my knowledge how things are done but the underlying concepts are the same :wink:.

1293,2017-11-02T13:01:06.000070,Johana,i think its for use outside of pycharm. that’s what it sounds like.

1293,2017-11-02T13:07:26.000300,Mallie,Do you know what max is in PyCharm?
1293,2017-11-02T13:07:39.000087,Frieda,nope. i don't even know if there is one
1293,2017-11-02T13:07:55.000397,Mallie,Ah I see it indicated but I'm so new I'm figuring out how to read it.
1293,2017-11-02T13:07:56.000270,Frieda,i just always turn on a right ruler in every editor
1293,2017-11-02T13:08:17.000005,Johana,the one they set for you automatically is 79 chars
1293,2017-11-02T13:09:27.000499,Mallie,"So mine came out-of-the-box at 120, found it."
1293,2017-11-02T13:09:42.000757,Mallie,I didn't change any Code Style settings.
1293,2017-11-02T13:09:55.000225,Frieda,79 is a good default. gives you a single character to wrap up with
1293,2017-11-02T13:10:08.000733,Frieda,embrace the `()`s for continuations and breaks
1293,2017-11-02T13:10:59.000133,Mallie,"I like that too, it's a project I don't manage but people use PyCharm, that's why I was trying to work it all out."
1293,2017-11-02T13:11:44.000571,Frieda,pycharm is a solid platform
1293,2017-11-02T13:12:00.000121,Mallie,"I've always verified with normal `flake`/`pep8`, so I didn't know why they were saying it was PEP8."
1293,2017-11-02T13:12:10.000676,Mallie,It looks like that is the only variation.
1293,2017-11-02T13:13:58.000163,Mallie,`pycodestyle --max-line-length=120` does the trick though

When I run it from the root of my app it goes through all my third party directories that have locale files and recreates .mo files for those as well.

1299,2017-11-02T18:43:06.000360,Micaela,(Python 2.7) How do I fix os.path.abspath from returning a “looped” or “doubled” directory path?
1299,2017-11-02T18:44:26.000364,Micaela,"basically, what I am getting is `/User/username/path/to/path/to/file` instead of `/User/username/path/to/file`"
1299,2017-11-02T18:45:47.000190,Micaela,The input being passed to os.path.abspath is the string `'to/file'`
1299,2017-11-02T18:46:40.000125,Micaela,I only seem to get this problem when running tests with `unittest`
1299,2017-11-02T18:46:52.000102,Micaela,"when the code is running live, no issues."
1299,2017-11-02T18:47:59.000419,Lory,Can you post the whole code snippet so we can have context

1299,2017-11-02T19:09:45.000353,Micaela,I inserted that doubling myself by accident

1303,2017-11-03T07:13:03.000100,Vada,you can use sed

1306,2017-11-03T08:12:51.000439,Rob,"any thoughts on best practice for variable names during a for each loop in python?

for i in items:
```
i is a terrible name because it's generally used for the index
```

for item in items
```
item is a poor choice because:
- refactoring tools may or may not be able to figure out 'item' needs to be changed if 'items' is renamed to something else.
- converting between plural and singular all the time is annoying and inconsistent.
- 'item' looks too similar to 'items'.
- if the list has a long name the nested code looks ugly. 
- if the loop is small, it's completely pointless and adds no value.
```

i kinda want to use ‘v’ or ‘e’ and just stick with it all the time, but nobody is doing this so i assume there is a reason for it?

i really hate for each loops lol, i like standard for loops"
1306,2017-11-03T08:14:16.000261,Meg,uhm
1306,2017-11-03T08:14:38.000034,Meg,"I really don’t care, tbh.  as long as its obvious what is the variable and what is the data structure"
1306,2017-11-03T08:15:08.000181,Meg,and the data structure name is appropriate
1306,2017-11-03T08:15:30.000126,Junita,"yeah, and I gotta say, I’m actually a huge fan of the plural vs singular thing.  I think that adds more clarity, not less"
1306,2017-11-03T08:15:39.000108,Meg,"for example, `item in items` is pretty easy to figure out, because one is plural and the other is singular"
1306,2017-11-03T08:16:14.000090,Meg,"then, when using `enumerate`, I do `for idx, val in enumerate(some_data_structure):`"
1306,2017-11-03T08:16:50.000178,Junita,"yup.  also, in general, probably not worth overthinking"
1306,2017-11-03T08:17:17.000020,Junita,"if it’s generally clear what’s going on, and there are no obvious problems, then it’s good to go"
1306,2017-11-03T08:19:11.000250,Meg,:thumbsup: for not overthinking

what we doing here?"
1307,2017-11-03T08:35:28.000322,Rob,"fwiw, i’m only over thinking this because i keep having to think about it when coding, i’d rather stick to something consistent and never think about it."
1307,2017-11-03T08:38:22.000429,Rob,"i think for item in items is perfectly fine, and probably a poor example. in reality it’s never usually that simple, and the list won’t necessarily even have a singular name. i guess it doesn’t really matter overall, just feels like i shouldn’t be thinking about this lol. if i had to come up with a unique variable name instead of using ‘i’ in regular for loops, it would begin to annoy me too :smile:"
1307,2017-11-03T08:40:19.000090,Ciera,what I usually do I name list with a plural so when doing `for i in my_list` I can use the singular
1307,2017-11-03T08:40:32.000140,Ciera,`for message in messages`
1307,2017-11-03T08:42:42.000234,Rob,"you won’t always be able to come up with a natural sounding name that has a singular version though, and even trying to do it in the first place bugs me a bit. i guess i’ll just stop being so obsessive over the little things :wink:"
1307,2017-11-03T08:43:22.000262,Ciera,it's not possible some time but most yes
1307,2017-11-03T08:43:56.000066,Ciera,but yeah if you can find something good enough it's probably :thumbsup:
1307,2017-11-03T08:44:03.000160,Ciera,you can also rename later
1307,2017-11-03T08:44:45.000234,Rob,"that’s the thing though, i don’t want to have to rename shit later haha, i’d rather just stick it as some single letter constant and never think about it again in my life"
1307,2017-11-03T08:45:45.000452,Ciera,always using the same letter for indices will get confusing sometime
1307,2017-11-03T08:45:54.000002,Ciera,what if you have two loops ?
1307,2017-11-03T08:46:08.000122,Rob,then i would give them descriptive names
1307,2017-11-03T08:46:45.000105,Rob,"but that case is rare enough that i don’t care, and i think in that case it actually adds a lot of value to be descriptive"

1322,2017-11-05T09:49:40.000014,Ciera,because it doesn't complete
1322,2017-11-05T09:49:50.000079,Ciera,it's in a `While True`
1322,2017-11-05T09:50:32.000074,Tyrone,"yeah, but i thought running that async would just let me to proceed"
1322,2017-11-05T09:51:02.000032,Tyrone,"basically, i have a Bot() class that is doing something with the received message, a TestMachine() class which is generating a lot of bots with random parameters and an Interceptor() class which connects to the socket (so `connect_socket()` is part of Interceptor() ). i don’t want to pass the bot collection to the interceptor, and i dont want to create a socket connection for every bot…"
1322,2017-11-05T09:51:06.000010,Tyrone,if that makes sense
1322,2017-11-05T09:52:00.000023,Tyrone,"if it was js or something i could call the bot on the message receive event, but here i am stuck"
1322,2017-11-05T09:52:02.000003,Ciera,well the interceptor could pass the incoming message to `TestMachine` and that route it to the correct/all bots
1322,2017-11-05T09:53:34.000026,Tyrone,hum
1322,2017-11-05T09:53:43.000100,Tyrone,"that sounds pretty good, stupid me. thanks!"
1323,2017-11-05T10:13:53.000038,Mandie, What is the difference in using _mkdir dirName_ and_ %mkdir dirName_ in jupyter notebook 
1323,2017-11-05T10:14:45.000044,Meg,the latter is just an alias for the `mkdir` command
1323,2017-11-05T10:17:06.000007,Mandie,"<@Meg> ,so we can use any of them. It won't affect the outcome,right? "
1323,2017-11-05T10:18:18.000129,Meg,I think you’re misunderstanding me.. check out <http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#line-magics> for more info
1323,2017-11-05T10:23:40.000015,Mandie,"Now I got it, thanks "
1323,2017-11-05T10:25:59.000071,Meg,:thumbsup:
1324,2017-11-05T18:38:38.000034,Dexter,hi….can someone help me figure out how to download a file from S3 to a [something] to store in an array?
1324,2017-11-05T18:38:57.000011,Dexter,"basically i have an s3 bucket with images, and i want to download all of them and store them in an array"
1324,2017-11-05T18:39:07.000031,Dexter,and use that array for an opencv face detection engine
1324,2017-11-05T18:42:20.000050,Casie,"Anyone has some advice on the following and how to solve this:
- There are 2 suppliers for a company with completely different API’s (one is XML over https, the other is WSDL with SOAP)
- Each supplier has a set of actions (Push an order, Get order status, Get return, Get Stockcounts).
- Each of these actions requires different mappings depending on supplier
- An action always has two things, “Map to the correct format”, “Get/Push the data from/to the API”

I’m trying to create some abstraction so it’s easy to add more suppliers later but I’m not sure how to do it.."
1324,2017-11-05T20:31:01.000054,Dexter,can anyone help me with a simpler one?  i want to only call a function once every 5 seconds at the most (within a while loop that’s always running)
1324,2017-11-05T20:31:06.000033,Dexter,so i want something like this:
1324,2017-11-05T20:31:58.000113,Dexter,"```now = curTime()
if now - lastTime &gt;=5:
     do_something()
lastTime = now()```"
1324,2017-11-05T20:32:31.000188,Dexter,"how do i set the current date/time into a variable, and then how do i compare two variables to see the difference in seconds between them?"
1324,2017-11-05T20:37:17.000095,Lory,<@Dexter> I'm not at my computer so I can't send any examples. But are you using the time library? <https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html>
1324,2017-11-05T21:12:41.000111,Dexter,"<@Bella> ill check that out, thanks!"
1325,2017-11-05T21:28:21.000131,Marcie,<@Casie> this sounds like a very good use case for Composition
1326,2017-11-06T02:19:00.000121,Jonnie,"Anyone has some advice on the following and how to get data:
Do you know the data dump or API for acquiring timezone by geoname_id?"
1327,2017-11-06T02:44:38.000056,Jama,I see that #general has become <#C07EFBK3R|announcements>. Is <#C07EFMZ1N|help> the general question asking channel now?
1328,2017-11-06T02:53:31.000024,Scot,"<@Jama> Well, the channel description does say ""ask anything""... Personally I'd rather be in a channel dedicated to solving code snippets rather than answering large general questions, but that's just like my opinion man"
1328,2017-11-06T03:01:35.000045,Jama,<@Dexter> You could do something like this using time.time()
1329,2017-11-06T05:27:55.000414,Bella,"<@Dexter> Nice, thanks! let me know please when you finished"
1330,2017-11-06T05:45:45.000019,Ronald,"Hi guys , does anyone know another package apart from scikit-learn to do Random Forest in Python?"
1330,2017-11-06T07:18:06.000210,Mandie,<@Ronald> not sure about any other package but if you can try <https://machinelearningmastery.com/implement-random-forest-scratch-python/>
1331,2017-11-06T09:07:38.000057,Johana,<@Dexter> if you need to access s3 you should be trying to use the boto3 library.
1332,2017-11-06T09:09:30.000556,Collette,"&gt; pyboto3
&gt; Pythonic Interface for AWS boto3 that gives you autocomplete on every service

WHYYYYYY?! WHY THIS IS NOT PRESENT BY DEFAULT IN BOTO3 ITSELF?"
1332,2017-11-06T09:10:34.000086,Collette,boto3 is soooo painful to use because of constant use of ⌘+⇥
1332,2017-11-06T09:10:42.000094,Collette,between the console and the browser
1332,2017-11-06T09:11:15.000203,Johana,"haha, that’s a good point."
1332,2017-11-06T09:15:47.000051,Winnifred,wish they had something similar for st3 ..
1332,2017-11-06T09:19:27.000006,Vada,It upsets me that we now have libraries to fix typehinting for other libraries
1332,2017-11-06T09:19:40.000284,Vada,without actually bringing those changes into the problematic library
1332,2017-11-06T09:21:13.000334,Collette,I doubt this problematic library will ever be actually fixed.
1332,2017-11-06T09:21:51.000358,Collette,"I understand the aws team's desire to avoid duplication of parameters, responses and documentation duplication"
1332,2017-11-06T09:23:39.000326,Collette,It's much simpler to generate classes and methods from an existing XML schema than to maintain a couple of dozens of fully documented SDKs
1333,2017-11-06T10:03:40.000752,Dexter,"is there a specific channel for OpenCV projects, or should I ask here?"
1333,2017-11-06T10:13:13.000640,Meg,here is probably best
1333,2017-11-06T10:14:49.000563,Dexter,cool
1333,2017-11-06T10:15:01.000699,Dexter,so i’ve got a basic face detection / recognition script
1333,2017-11-06T10:16:16.000094,Dexter,and it works great with a webcam
1333,2017-11-06T10:16:23.000458,Dexter,it detects all the faces just like it should
1333,2017-11-06T10:16:33.000158,Dexter,"but for some reason, when using an IP camera feed, it can’t detect anything"
1333,2017-11-06T10:16:54.000370,Dexter,"the feed itself shows up fine in the resulting video window, every frame, every second"
1333,2017-11-06T10:16:59.000366,Dexter,but it never is able to detect any faces
1333,2017-11-06T10:17:02.000526,Dexter,not sure what im doing wrong
1333,2017-11-06T10:17:57.000489,Meg,"hmm, can you confirm that the image data is loading in your script?"
1333,2017-11-06T10:18:10.000484,Meg,maybe its coming in as a different format than the webcam?
1333,2017-11-06T10:18:28.000141,Dexter,how do i confirm?
1333,2017-11-06T10:19:07.000726,Dexter,here are the relevant lines
1333,2017-11-06T10:19:09.000553,Meg,logging
1333,2017-11-06T10:19:13.000381,Meg,debugger
1333,2017-11-06T10:19:19.000230,Sirena,or try recognizing somethign other than a face
1333,2017-11-06T10:19:19.000613,Dexter,"`video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(""<http://192.168.1.2/axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi>"")`"

    # Resize frame of video to 1/4 size for faster face recognition processing

1333,2017-11-06T10:19:44.000295,Dexter,what should i output?
1333,2017-11-06T10:20:01.000788,Dexter,"because this `cv2.imshow('Video', frame)` outputs the feed to my screen, and it looks fine"
1333,2017-11-06T10:20:07.000035,Dexter,i see everything i expect to see
1333,2017-11-06T10:20:23.000195,Dexter,"(meaning, the video feed)"
1333,2017-11-06T10:20:55.000024,Meg,hmm
1333,2017-11-06T10:21:05.000612,Meg,"so, does that url require any kind of login?"
1333,2017-11-06T10:21:10.000344,Meg,or is it password protected?
1333,2017-11-06T10:21:12.000031,Dexter,nope….
1333,2017-11-06T10:21:29.000539,Dexter,"and when the script is running, there’s a cv2 window that’s open, and it shows the feed from the camera perfectly"
1333,2017-11-06T10:21:41.000390,Dexter,it just never seems to detect any faces
1333,2017-11-06T10:21:43.000414,Meg,interesting
1333,2017-11-06T10:21:59.000260,Dexter,"and when i switch the feed to be my webcam, the exact same application works perfectly"
1333,2017-11-06T10:21:59.000564,Meg,do you know how to debug python?
1333,2017-11-06T10:22:10.000583,Dexter,"not so much, im just getting started"
1333,2017-11-06T10:22:16.000139,Dexter,should i get pycharm?
1333,2017-11-06T10:22:45.000210,Meg,what I suspect is the feed from the IP camera is different in some way from the web camera
1333,2017-11-06T10:23:06.000342,Meg,the cv2 window showing the feed probably knows how to handle the difference
1333,2017-11-06T10:23:14.000601,Meg,but the face detection script doesn’t
1333,2017-11-06T10:23:41.000159,Dexter,hmmm
1333,2017-11-06T10:23:46.000079,Meg,"so, in this case, an IDE with a debugger would probably help"
1333,2017-11-06T10:23:54.000568,Dexter,interesting…..is there a way to convert the “read” frame into some other format?
1333,2017-11-06T10:23:56.000378,Meg,"short of that, put in logging statements in your face detector code"
1333,2017-11-06T10:24:00.000407,Dexter,can u recommend an ide?
1333,2017-11-06T10:24:14.000613,Meg,"I like pycharm, and think you would get by fine with the free version"
1333,2017-11-06T10:24:41.000484,Meg,"and as far as conversions, you would have to dig in the opencv documentation for that"
1333,2017-11-06T10:25:52.000353,Sirena,"if you don't want to jump into an IDE right this moment, you can also insert python debugger statements and debug on the cmd line, if that somehow sounds preferable to you"
1333,2017-11-06T10:26:14.000177,Sirena,"otherwise, I second <@Meg>'s vote for pycharm"
1333,2017-11-06T10:27:26.000086,Ciera,ipdb is a good interactive debugger
1333,2017-11-06T10:27:28.000253,Dexter,k…setting up pycharm now
1333,2017-11-06T10:27:31.000166,Ciera,in cmd line
1333,2017-11-06T10:27:39.000166,Dexter,"will try the breakpoint on the read, and see if i can determine the frame format"
1333,2017-11-06T10:27:40.000458,Dexter,standby
1333,2017-11-06T10:29:21.000402,Dexter,how do i add a python interpreter
1333,2017-11-06T10:29:26.000291,Dexter,in the build configuration
1333,2017-11-06T10:29:32.000003,Dexter,the dropdown is empty and i can’t see where to add anything
1333,2017-11-06T10:30:55.000253,Dexter,nvm i got it
1333,2017-11-06T10:34:23.000548,Dexter,ok
1333,2017-11-06T10:34:28.000131,Dexter,i set my interpreter to python 3.6
1333,2017-11-06T10:34:31.000248,Dexter,when i try to debug my script
1333,2017-11-06T10:34:38.000086,Dexter,it breaks in this file

1333,2017-11-06T10:34:44.000127,Dexter,anyone know why?
1333,2017-11-06T10:35:00.000562,Dexter,"the exec line has a breakpoint (that i didn’t set), when i hit continue, python either crashes or it just ends"
1333,2017-11-06T10:38:45.000180,Meg,did you right click in the editor window and select run as debug?
1333,2017-11-06T10:38:59.000601,Dexter,yes
1333,2017-11-06T10:40:14.000278,Dexter,yes

1333,2017-11-06T10:41:40.000595,Meg,and what’s the error output when you resume?
1333,2017-11-06T10:41:45.000400,Dexter,"nothing, it just ends"
1333,2017-11-06T10:41:55.000510,Meg,nothing in debug console?
1333,2017-11-06T10:41:57.000314,Ciera,would it be possible to split the line in multiple line N
1333,2017-11-06T10:42:18.000144,Ciera,like first the compile then the exec
1333,2017-11-06T10:44:39.000344,Dexter,"ah, wasn’t looking at the console output"
1333,2017-11-06T10:44:45.000032,Dexter,standby fixing an error
1333,2017-11-06T10:47:35.000706,Dexter,ok
1333,2017-11-06T10:47:36.000576,Dexter,working
1333,2017-11-06T10:47:43.000380,Dexter,breakpoint after the `read` statement
1333,2017-11-06T10:47:47.000776,Dexter,it’s not telling me much about format though
1333,2017-11-06T10:47:57.000064,Dexter,soi
1333,2017-11-06T10:48:08.000027,Dexter,i think ur theory <@Meg> is probably correct
1333,2017-11-06T10:48:23.000464,Dexter,do u know of the method to convert a “frame” to another format?
1333,2017-11-06T10:48:45.000567,Meg,that’s where you have to dig into the documentation ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1333,2017-11-06T10:48:53.000374,Dexter,struggling
1333,2017-11-06T10:48:56.000010,Dexter,hate their documentation
1333,2017-11-06T11:04:19.000374,Dexter,still no luck here
1334,2017-11-06T10:39:10.000332,Meg,same error?
1334,2017-11-06T10:42:24.000492,Meg,oh.. is that your file or is it something else?
1334,2017-11-06T10:42:25.000382,Ciera,and maybe see what is being compiled first
1334,2017-11-06T11:04:25.000528,Dexter,if anyone has any ideas i’d be much appreciative!
1335,2017-11-06T11:16:32.000382,Grayce,"Hello, definitely a newbie here. I'm trying to get values from a JSON file and part of my code is this:

`TypeError: the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not 'TextIOWrapper'`"
1335,2017-11-06T11:17:11.000474,Toby,how do you define init_deployment?
1335,2017-11-06T11:18:17.000455,Toby,`init_deployment = open(&lt;pathToFile&gt;)`?

1335,2017-11-06T11:21:52.000191,Collette,<@Grayce> how do you use `json_data`?
1335,2017-11-06T11:22:06.000782,Collette,There should be some sort of `.iteritems` call

1335,2017-11-06T11:26:18.000419,Collette,<@Toby> that's simply not true for a couple of years already.
1335,2017-11-06T11:26:27.000263,Collette,"More than that, there are py3-only libraries."
1335,2017-11-06T11:26:46.000044,Collette,"For instance, I'm making one right now"
1335,2017-11-06T11:27:33.000613,Lory,I am still gripping onto 2.7 like my life depends on it lol
1335,2017-11-06T11:27:39.000609,Toby,<https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3>
1335,2017-11-06T11:28:05.000093,Toby,"if im not using libraries or any io boards, id use 3.6, else 2.7 all the way"
1335,2017-11-06T11:31:21.000720,Collette,What should this link provide us?
1335,2017-11-06T11:31:46.000444,Collette,OTOH there are <http://py3readiness.org/> and <https://python3wos.appspot.com/>
1335,2017-11-06T11:31:59.000661,Toby,look under the `Which version should I use?` section
1335,2017-11-06T11:33:12.000062,Collette,"So... the vast majority of active libraries are ported to py3, there are py3-only libraries, and you still think that if you have an external dependency you'd better go with py2?"
1335,2017-11-06T11:33:27.000212,Collette,What are you going to do past 2020?
1335,2017-11-06T11:34:28.000259,Collette,"Are you still on ubuntu 8.04, by the way? Next year py3 will be literally 10 years old"
1335,2017-11-06T11:35:23.000294,Toby,"dont use ubuntu, i use windows like normal devs who dont dev for tinkerboards"
1335,2017-11-06T11:36:11.000418,Collette,"Okay, I guess you're still using Windows XP then."
1335,2017-11-06T11:37:04.000723,Collette,<@Grayce> have you managed to resolve your issue?
1335,2017-11-06T11:37:48.000213,Toby,im on windows 10... anyone who uses 7 or older needs to get an upgrade or their pc removing from them
1335,2017-11-06T11:40:12.000895,Collette,then your opinions about versioning and supporting old versions of software are quite inconsistent ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1335,2017-11-06T11:40:42.000859,Toby,im not on about supporting old os' tho
1335,2017-11-06T11:40:59.000041,Collette,"So to speak, I have windows 7 on my gaming machine. And I won't upgrade to 10, unless it's un-shitted"
1335,2017-11-06T11:41:10.000056,Toby,oh god...
1335,2017-11-06T11:41:16.000672,Toby,update to 10 already
1335,2017-11-06T11:41:42.000320,Collette,"Python 3 is great, that's what makes it different from windows 10 :slightly_smiling_face: Anyway, that's a topic for <#C07EFN21K|random>"
1335,2017-11-06T11:41:48.000344,Collette,We can go there if you'd like to continue
1335,2017-11-06T11:52:11.000513,Grayce,"Hello <@Collette> yes, done with the first part. Thanks, and also <@Toby>!"
1336,2017-11-06T12:40:39.000139,Ernestina,"Hey guys question. when defining a class, why does it need to have `self` in the methods?"
1336,2017-11-06T12:40:53.000161,Ernestina,"for example: 
```class Dataset(object):
  def __init__(self, name, path, schema, type, prefix, primaryKey, separator='\t', header=None):
    self.name = name  # in format abacus_dataset_name
    self.path = path
    self.schema = schema
    self.type = type
    self.prefix = prefix
    self.primaryKey = primaryKey
    self.separator = separator
    self.header = header

  def show(self):
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('name = {}'.format(self.name))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('path = {}'.format(self.path))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('type = {}'.format(self.type))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('prefix = {}'.format(self.prefix))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('primaryKey = {}'.format(self.primaryKey))
    <http://Log.info|Log.info>('schema = {}'.format(self.schema))
```"
1336,2017-11-06T12:41:08.000557,Frieda,`self` refers to the instance that's calling the class method
1336,2017-11-06T12:41:09.000059,Ernestina,why does show(self) need to be that way
1336,2017-11-06T12:41:33.000325,Ernestina,Got it
1336,2017-11-06T12:41:44.000715,Frieda,"it doesn't _have_ to be `self`, either"
1336,2017-11-06T12:41:51.000397,Frieda,`def show(this):` works just as well
1336,2017-11-06T12:41:54.000584,Frieda,but you'll get weird looks
1336,2017-11-06T12:45:20.000091,Meg,the `why` for that is convention
1336,2017-11-06T12:45:48.000099,Meg,"coming from java, where `this` is the same as `self`, and is implicit to classes, was a big context switch for me"
1336,2017-11-06T12:47:51.000034,Collette,and the fact lots of java devs really _like_ that they can omit `this`
1336,2017-11-06T12:48:06.000134,Frieda,also different from javascript in that `self` never changes what it points to. it's always the instance
1336,2017-11-06T12:48:59.000118,Junita,"yeah that’s something I like about Python - things like are usually more explicit, there’s less magic"
1336,2017-11-06T12:50:05.000458,Frieda,we keep our magic contained inside of underscores
1336,2017-11-06T12:50:11.000190,Junita,heh
1336,2017-11-06T12:51:53.000396,Ciera,I wonder how it would feel to find code where the author doesn't use `self` but something completely irrelevant
1336,2017-11-06T12:51:58.000467,Ciera,like `banana`
1336,2017-11-06T12:52:38.000051,Junita,"I have come across code where the author used other things than self, and it was jarring to say the least"
1336,2017-11-06T12:52:41.000324,Junita,it at least vaguely made sense
1336,2017-11-06T12:52:48.000423,Frieda,<@Ciera> try it yourself for a day :smile:
1336,2017-11-06T12:52:51.000396,Frieda,"on a branch, of course"
1336,2017-11-06T12:53:06.000495,Ciera,no sure the code review will go ok :smile:
1336,2017-11-06T12:53:55.000191,Winnifred,lol
1336,2017-11-06T12:54:21.000434,Frieda,conventions are a great thing on issues that don't really matter
1336,2017-11-06T12:56:04.000154,Collette,"```
class Banana:
    def do_banana_stuff(banana):
        banana.do_another_stuff()

banana = Banana()
banana.do_banana_stuff()
```"
1336,2017-11-06T12:56:06.000658,Collette,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1336,2017-11-06T12:56:23.000527,Collette,`Banana.do_banana_stuff(banana)`
1336,2017-11-06T12:56:37.000117,Meg,`bannanaception`
1336,2017-11-06T12:56:49.000426,Winnifred,i'm slipping on this banana stuff
1336,2017-11-06T12:57:05.000321,Jenise,`bananarama`...[]
1336,2017-11-06T12:57:50.000435,Ciera,Using `class.__name__` as `self` could make sense :thinking_face:
1336,2017-11-06T12:58:27.000197,Porsha,how?
1336,2017-11-06T12:59:08.000113,Frieda,i'd constantly think you were trying to be clever with class methods
1336,2017-11-06T12:59:21.000731,Frieda,...but then notice the lack of `@classmethod` and wonder how the hell you got that to work
1336,2017-11-06T12:59:43.000395,Collette,`@bananamethod`
1336,2017-11-06T12:59:54.000009,Ciera,using `self` in `classmethod` would be the worst :smile:
1336,2017-11-06T13:00:32.000611,Frieda,i'm sure people do it all the time
1336,2017-11-06T13:00:45.000456,Frieda,you're converting a method from instance to class...forget to rename that parameter...
1337,2017-11-06T13:49:19.000033,Max,Hey! I'm trying to start a bootcamp in my university to try and get people into coding. I was wondering if any of you could help me compile resources from across the web for an absolute beginner to learn python. 
1337,2017-11-06T13:50:03.000301,Frieda,"""automate the boring stuff"" is free online, IIRC"
1337,2017-11-06T13:50:10.000418,Frieda,i'd start them off with that
1337,2017-11-06T13:50:15.000438,Seema,(I was going to type something but I'm more curious what kenneth has to say)
1337,2017-11-06T13:50:21.000278,Frieda,especially in school when you have a lot of boring stuff
1337,2017-11-06T13:50:25.000285,Lory,"That's a great book, enjoyed it so much I bought the real thing haha"
1337,2017-11-06T13:51:02.000519,Frieda,"lol. i am _not_ the end-all, be-all guide to learning python :smile:"
1337,2017-11-06T13:51:18.000624,Seema,"true, but don't you/ didn't you teach python at college level?"
1337,2017-11-06T13:51:30.000706,Frieda,i taught for <http://teamtreehouse.com|teamtreehouse.com>
1337,2017-11-06T13:51:40.000354,Frieda,so everyone from 11 year olds to 90 year olds
1337,2017-11-06T13:51:50.000850,Frieda,all education levels and such too
1337,2017-11-06T13:52:44.000335,Frieda,i keep thinking about trying to get in as a teacher for a community college or something but that's a heck of a pay cut. hard to do that w/ kids and mortgage
1337,2017-11-06T13:52:58.000673,Seema,"<@Max> you are effectively running a non-for-profit business with this idea, selling it, hoping for consumers, just no money.  I would recommend finding some test customers and trying it out on them, seeing what other colleges have tried, seeing where the need is as well as finding focusing your attention to a narrow group."
1337,2017-11-06T13:53:24.000500,Seema,"where's the emoji for ""I hear you on that one""..."
1337,2017-11-06T13:53:52.000637,Frieda,state university would probably be alright so long as i wasn't just an adjunct
1337,2017-11-06T13:54:06.000525,Frieda,but i don't necessarily have the qualifications
1337,2017-11-06T13:54:57.000439,Seema,"In California, the community college professors were killing it awhile ago.  The state and UC professors were not thrilled.  Focus certainly mattered but the three tier system can be skewed"
1337,2017-11-06T13:58:40.000500,Max,<@Seema> thank you for your suggestion. we are just a group of college students trying to teach each other. I just want a professional in the field to look through our curated content list and approve.
1337,2017-11-06T13:59:25.000213,Frieda,"we're having some pretty major internet weirdness here today, so i'll check when i can, <@Max>"
1337,2017-11-06T13:59:59.000245,Max,The first course is on basic python. Then we are going into deep learning.
1337,2017-11-06T14:00:16.000800,Seema,"by ""data science"" I mean anything from basic statistics to any field that uses data"
1337,2017-11-06T14:00:35.000387,Lory,"<@Frieda> You're connection got bogged? ours went down within the past 45 minutes, whole office is freaking out cause we can't launch our project"
1337,2017-11-06T14:01:09.000097,Frieda,<@Lory> i'm just having a terrible time loading...almost any site
1337,2017-11-06T14:01:14.000026,Seema,"there's considerable need to be able to data manipulation.  As far as ml goes, have you seen the openai or serpent stuff.  The learning curve is probably too steep for a beginner programmer but it might be something to consider for later on"
1337,2017-11-06T14:01:15.000417,Frieda,AWS or DNS or something went down somewhere
1337,2017-11-06T14:01:46.000154,Lory,glad to see we weren't the only ones at least. We've had DNS attacks in the past
1337,2017-11-06T14:01:59.000077,Seema,"DNS is resolving for me, but loading is literally hit or miss, some sites boom, other sides, clockwise for a long time"
1337,2017-11-06T14:02:00.000358,Frieda,"no, it seems pretty wide spread"
1337,2017-11-06T14:02:20.000459,Seema,"craigslist can't even load for me!  Washington Post, no problem"
1337,2017-11-06T14:02:20.000804,Frieda,i'd go see if there's buzz about it on twitter but twitter isn't loading
1337,2017-11-06T14:03:38.000412,Max,Yeah. I had a look at it. We will just be touching upon implementation without going into the detailed math. 
1337,2017-11-06T14:03:55.000251,Lory,Just wish our clients would realize that and stop asking why they have no access lol
1337,2017-11-06T14:04:20.000580,Frieda,"if clients knew those kinds of technical things, they wouldn't need you"
1337,2017-11-06T14:04:29.000344,Seema,do you have docker as part of your curriculum?  jupyter notebooks?
1337,2017-11-06T14:04:37.000005,Lory,the gift and the curse
1337,2017-11-06T14:15:20.000628,Lory,"managed to get a google result snippet form twitter, not confirmed but it says Comcast has a nationwide outage posted by Burlington Press"
1337,2017-11-06T14:15:58.000073,Frieda,joy. guess who my service provider is?
1337,2017-11-06T14:16:18.000504,Lory,Us too haha
1337,2017-11-06T14:16:22.000413,Lory,Comcast strikes again....
1337,2017-11-06T14:16:48.000069,Frieda,there are _no_ reliable alternatives here. :rage:
1337,2017-11-06T14:17:46.000441,Lory,"we have Optimum in a few spots near us, I enjoyed them when i had them at home for a while but unfortunately Comcast has them locked out to very specific areas"
1337,2017-11-06T14:17:50.000010,Lory,Google FIber SAVE US
1337,2017-11-06T14:18:03.000611,Frieda,"google fiber isn't expanding any more, IIRC"
1337,2017-11-06T14:18:12.000445,Lory,So I've heard
1337,2017-11-06T14:18:13.000211,Frieda,they were gonna come here but then shut down
1337,2017-11-06T14:18:29.000687,Lory,God forbid someone comes in to take out Comcast
1337,2017-11-06T14:20:13.000610,Dexter,<@Meg> i figured out my issue
1337,2017-11-06T14:20:20.000407,Dexter,i needed to change a parameter in the face detection library
1337,2017-11-06T14:20:41.000640,Dexter,"the people on the security camera (in the ceiling) were much smaller than the webcam, and there’s a setting related to the size of expected faces"
1337,2017-11-06T14:31:07.000003,Lory,And looks like Comcast is back
1337,2017-11-06T14:32:38.000206,Seema,I can load craigslist now!
1338,2017-11-06T13:59:11.000683,Seema,Are you doing data science work?
1339,2017-11-06T14:33:03.000091,Seema,Amazon was peppy but when I couldn't load a text based page I knew something was fishy
1340,2017-11-06T14:52:58.000057,Ernestina,"if I want to use call another function in the same class,"
1340,2017-11-06T14:53:14.000246,Ernestina,both methods are in the same class
1340,2017-11-06T14:53:34.000030,Ernestina,"There is no need to make it explicit, correct?"
1340,2017-11-06T14:57:06.000151,Ernestina,"Or how to make it explicit,"
1340,2017-11-06T15:00:34.000620,Delicia,"<@Ernestina>: You make it explicit with `self`, which specifies the particular instance of your class"
1340,2017-11-06T15:00:36.000801,Delicia,e.g.
1340,2017-11-06T15:01:29.000041,Lory,haha honestly
1340,2017-11-06T15:01:48.000399,Ernestina,so what does the self.bleat() here do?
1340,2017-11-06T15:02:04.000630,Ernestina,Like can you call `self.bleat()` as a function?
1340,2017-11-06T15:03:17.000353,Delicia,You'd call it as a method of a `Goat` instance
1340,2017-11-06T15:06:32.000324,Ernestina,"Makes sense now. SO when initinating a new object , in this case `goat`, it automatically called the self.beat()"
1340,2017-11-06T15:07:00.000294,Delicia,Exactly right :slightly_smiling_face:
1340,2017-11-06T15:09:38.000406,Ernestina,thank you!
1341,2017-11-06T16:28:30.000388,Genesis,Teamtreehouse pays more than a being an adjunct prof at a community college??  :confused:
1342,2017-11-06T16:41:14.000693,Ernestina,So when to use static method vs class method.
1342,2017-11-06T16:41:20.000407,Ernestina,anyone can help?
1342,2017-11-06T16:44:48.000178,Frieda,"According to the numbers I've seen, yes"
1342,2017-11-06T16:44:57.000005,Frieda,Public teachers are paid pretty badly
1342,2017-11-06T16:46:57.000165,Suellen,"staticmethod when it could as well be a function elsewhere, but conceptually fits in the class"
1342,2017-11-06T16:47:12.000127,Genesis,damn...
1342,2017-11-06T16:48:04.000282,Suellen,"classmethod is for when you need a class object, not any instance in particular. For example when you want to create an instance yourself, like `__init__` does."
1342,2017-11-06T16:48:30.000219,Frieda,and Treehouse was a full time job with decent benefits and a not-too-bad salary
1342,2017-11-06T16:48:33.000543,Suellen,that's my take :stuck_out_tongue:
1342,2017-11-06T16:49:01.000344,Frieda,"you almost never actually _need_ `@staticmethod`. it's more about organization, like <@Suellen> said."
1342,2017-11-06T16:49:39.000331,Ciera,or because pycharm is complaining :smile:
1342,2017-11-06T16:50:40.000400,Suellen,so true
1342,2017-11-06T16:51:09.000340,Ernestina,I don’t get the pycharm is complaning part haha

1344,2017-11-06T17:43:43.000330,Frieda,"check if the path exists, if so, do what you want"
1344,2017-11-06T17:43:53.000259,Frieda,"if the path doesn't exist, your loop should just continue on its own"
1344,2017-11-06T17:45:40.000240,Ciera,or catch the error and continue
1344,2017-11-06T17:46:21.000405,Frieda,"yeah, that should throw `FileNotFoundError`"
1344,2017-11-06T17:46:29.000040,Ciera,checking the path might not work if something else is moving the files around
1344,2017-11-06T17:46:45.000383,Frieda,well you'd have to use the path to access the file anyway so...
1344,2017-11-06T17:48:11.000305,Ciera,yeah but it's an habit to take. It could be possible that something else move/delete the file between the time you check for the path and the time you access th efile

1344,2017-11-06T18:07:38.000353,Frieda,<@Vena> don't do naked `except`s like that. they'll swallow _all_ errors that the encapsulated code throws and you won't know if something breaks in a new/unexpected way

1344,2017-11-06T18:11:59.000303,Myong,But it doesn't seem to be the issue. Signal.pause() just won't detect the press
1344,2017-11-06T18:12:13.000078,Myong,But if I step to just before pause the presses are detected
1344,2017-11-06T18:13:11.000100,Vena,<@Frieda> Interesting. Got it. Thanks.
1344,2017-11-06T18:14:05.000097,Frieda,"<@Myong> sorry, no idea."
1344,2017-11-06T18:15:20.000076,Marcie,<@Myong> does it do the same thing on another linux system?
1344,2017-11-06T18:15:39.000326,Myong,I can't check at the moment it's the only Linux system I have
1344,2017-11-06T18:16:00.000162,Myong,I tried `sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`
1344,2017-11-06T18:17:08.000037,Myong,Doesn't work with using `while True: time.sleep(1)`
1344,2017-11-06T18:18:44.000001,Marcie,check to see if anything for `signal.getsignal(2)` return anythings beforehand
1344,2017-11-06T18:29:05.000052,Myong,Like so?
1344,2017-11-06T18:30:30.000230,Marcie,"i believe so yeah, you generally just want to check that you're setup to handle a signal"
1344,2017-11-06T18:31:50.000016,Myong,It brings up an object for signal handler
1344,2017-11-06T18:33:03.000358,Myong,I mispoke
1344,2017-11-06T18:36:59.000259,Myong,Maybe I could try GPIO native add callback
1345,2017-11-06T18:31:03.000021,Marcie,pause internally uses `signal(2)` which itself is normally fine on x86 linux systems but gets weird once you start working on other hardware :disappointed:
1346,2017-11-06T18:47:55.000282,Iluminada,Hello guys! any recommendations in dealing with time series data that has one insertion each day? I am currently using postgres and django
1347,2017-11-06T18:48:03.000003,Leon,"Hi all. I'm trying to write a loop along the lines of `for number in numbers`. Sometimes numbers will contain multiple values and be a tuple `('1', '2')` but other times it may just be a single number. When it's just a single number, python is splitting the number. Ie: 12 becomes `[1, 2]`. Does anyone know how to work around this issue?"
1347,2017-11-06T18:50:20.000005,Frieda,you'd need to detect whether it's a number or tuple first
1347,2017-11-06T18:52:14.000052,Corrinne,Paste a small snippet of your code and the outupt :slightly_smiling_face:
1347,2017-11-06T18:53:27.000088,Leon,"```    # Parse parameters
    for param in sys.argv:
        if param.startswith('event='):
            event_ids = param.split('=')[1]

            # See if we have multiple event ids
            if ',' in event_ids:
                event_ids = event_ids.split(',')"
1347,2017-11-06T18:55:45.000092,Leon,"The code takes a parameter of event= where the value could be a single diget (ie: 21) or multiple comma separate digits (21, 22, 23 etc):
```
    # Parse parameters
    for param in sys.argv:
        if param.startswith('event='):
            event_ids = param.split('=')[1]

            # See if we have multiple event ids
            if ',' in event_ids:
                event_ids = event_ids.split(',')
```

Further down I want to loop over these, regardless of whether it's a single value or multiple:
```
    for event_id in event_ids:
        event = misp.get_event(event_id)
        print event
```

The problem is that if it's a single value (ie: 21) then python will split the string and instead loop over with a value of '2',  and then '1'."
1347,2017-11-06T18:56:52.000187,Marcie,you can use split on a string to get a list even if theres nothing to split on
1347,2017-11-06T18:57:26.000081,Marcie,"```In [1]: '21'.split(',')
Out[1]: ['21']

In [2]: '21,22'.split(',')
Out[2]: ['21', '22']```"
1347,2017-11-06T18:58:04.000117,Marcie,so just always split the `event_ids` string and you'll be able to iterate over single or multiple values
1347,2017-11-06T18:58:45.000176,Leon,<@Marcie> spot on! That's now working as expected. Thanks very much.
1347,2017-11-06T18:58:53.000077,Marcie,:toot:
1347,2017-11-06T18:59:04.000015,Leon,... and removes the need for that if statement to boot :slightly_smiling_face:
1347,2017-11-06T18:59:12.000365,Marcie,yup!
1347,2017-11-06T19:43:28.000031,Marcie,<@Sharika> are you able to select that element in the chrome devtool if you turn javascript off?
1347,2017-11-06T19:44:05.000029,Marcie,that's what i'd reckon yeah
1347,2017-11-06T19:44:31.000051,Marcie,if its not being rendered serverside then that react-root points to it being a react component and thus won't exist in the DOM without splash

1349,2017-11-06T22:08:06.000055,Lory,"if not defined, it will default to a `GET` request, you have to define `method='POST'` in order to send a post request"

```"
1349,2017-11-06T22:12:25.000087,Lory,you can import them as modules and execute them that way
1349,2017-11-06T22:12:58.000024,So,"from path import x
from path import y"
1349,2017-11-06T22:13:59.000235,Burma,the python scripts would be in the same directory as the main.py would this cause a conflict ?
1349,2017-11-06T22:14:45.000187,Lory,as long as they aren't named something that takes precedence over another module
1349,2017-11-06T22:15:01.000005,So,"from yourmodule import x
from yourmodule import y"
1349,2017-11-06T22:15:07.000053,So,if same path
1349,2017-11-06T22:15:38.000208,Burma,sounds good I'll give it a try
1349,2017-11-06T22:15:45.000153,Lory,"so like the time module, if you name a py file `time.py` within that directory then trying to import pythons time module wouldn't work"

1349,2017-11-06T22:19:14.000097,So,thanks <@Lory>
1349,2017-11-06T22:22:40.000103,Lory,yea pythons import system is fairly simple once yo understand how it works. It just seems daunting because it seems to work like magic to a beginner. At least that's how I felt haha
1349,2017-11-06T22:25:24.000228,Burma,haha yea Foresure I'll stick with it :sweat_smile:

1349,2017-11-07T09:30:09.000497,Lahoma,<@Vada> yes generally im not sure what the difference is and which one should be used.  It appears one can accomplish the same thing using ether of the options.  Not really asking any spepfic other than what is the difference and how would one make choice on which one to use.  I do know they handle arguments differently.

1349,2017-11-07T09:34:29.000122,Vada,I'd use subprocess for ffmpeg as there is no direct interface using os
1349,2017-11-07T09:35:24.000287,Lahoma,<@Vada> what do you mean by no direct interface using OS?  to me the only difference i see is in the way i use arguments.

Add auth for redis and export the password as an environment variable. You guys have any feedbacks. Is it good bad or do you think it doesnt make much of a difference."
1365,2017-11-08T05:07:17.000484,Ciera,do you have a lot of pem file ? or just one ?
1365,2017-11-08T05:07:28.000334,Suellen,I very much doubt that reading from Redis is faster than reading a file.

1366,2017-11-08T12:54:08.000409,Richelle,"OK, I've been working on something and can't seem to get all the pieces together correctly.  The goal: Take a list of list of strings (results of a query from a SQL database), (hopefully) compress it, and ship it to an Azure blob storage as .tsv files.  All in memory.  The azure-storage library has a create_blob_from_stream option which I've successfully used to send a `io.BytesIO` stream (without compressing) and it works as intended, although I think it could be cleaned up.  Ultimately, I'm not sure I'm fully understanding the various pieces of the `io` standard library and want to get some suggestions on how to improve things.  I can't seem to get the compression working (tried zipfile and gzip) and I run into issue where I'll open(..., 'w') the GzipFile/ZipFile, write contents to it, but then can't send it to blob because it doesn't have read access (because I opened it with write to add to the compressed file?)"
1366,2017-11-08T12:55:07.000415,Richelle,Trying to keep it as lightweight as possible since it's going to be running on an RPi (hence the trying to avoid writing to disk aspect)
1366,2017-11-08T12:58:23.000280,Richelle,"The compression might be optional if the overhead of compressing isn't worth doing it (to lower the bandwidth), I was going to test doing it with/without and see if it was worth the tradeoff in time spent sending it to blob uncompressed vs compressed).  I can't imagine the overhead is a lot but I honestly have no clue and I'm trying to not prematurely optimize before needed.  Would love thoughts from anyone who's more familiar with this stuff"
1366,2017-11-08T12:59:32.000695,Meg,"so I guess my first question would be, does this work without compression?"
1366,2017-11-08T13:00:49.000431,Richelle,"Yes.  It feels super hacky, and I'm not sure BytesIO is what I ultimately want to be using, but it works."

1366,2017-11-08T13:04:19.000242,Richelle,Or maybe TextIOWrapper? That seems more like for loading from a file on disk rather than a stream
1366,2017-11-08T13:09:30.000371,Meg,you could look into temporary files

1366,2017-11-08T13:19:59.000499,Richelle,Doesn't that create temporary files on the disk potentially?
1366,2017-11-08T13:21:50.000625,Meg,and is cleaned up after you close
1366,2017-11-08T13:22:18.000331,Meg,"so if you create it within a context manager, eg `with open(temp_file)`, it cleans up when the block finishes"
1366,2017-11-08T13:23:34.000478,Richelle,"Is a potential option, except we don't want to write anything to disk at all unless we really have to.  Mostly because with RPi's will burn out the SD card with constant read/writes which normally isn't a problem with most applications"
1366,2017-11-08T13:25:41.000328,Meg,have you seen this?

1366,2017-11-08T13:36:16.000159,Richelle,"Or maybe I have the whole process a little switched up.  Maybe I need to do something like open a stream `f`, with `gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=f, 'w')` add the relevant row elements to that Gzip, which maybe puts that compressed stuff into the stream f?"

Now I'm making a webscraper, and as I find new things to add to my db, I want to make sure they're not already in my db. My first thought is that I can just use a try/catch as my way of telling whether it's unique or not. My question is whether this is a good idea or not. I can't really articulate why, but it  just feels to me like this isn't really the intended use of try/catch and it's a bit hackish. Is using try/catch in this way a bad design choice?"

I found myself reusing the same stream object over many iterations of a loop, but wasn't finding any issues even when using `seek(0)` about data being duplicated.  I'd rather be safe than sorry, but I'd like to understand it's behavior a little more"
1369,2017-11-08T14:41:45.000002,Meg,"as I understand it, when you do `seek(0)`, it moves the pointer to the 0th byte of the stream.  so when any writes happen, the bytes before that get overwritten"

1369,2017-11-08T14:52:48.000217,Richelle,"So what i'm doing currently is: write to stream, seek(0), then send that stream somewhere else (like azure blob in my case), then repeat for the next thing in my list using the same stream.  I'm not currently getting any duplicate data, but it feels wrong.  I think I'm going to switch it so it's using a fresh `BytesIO` object each time, since some initial googling tells me that making a new stream is just easier than worrying about reusing an old one"
1369,2017-11-08T14:53:23.000511,Meg,makes sense
1369,2017-11-08T14:53:26.000231,Richelle,"Mostly it feels wrong because the next time I did seek(0) I would expect to see duplicate data (the stuff from the first iteration of the loop, plus the stuff for the current loop)"
1369,2017-11-08T14:53:42.000260,Meg,because the old stream will be garbage collected when all references don’t exist
1369,2017-11-08T14:53:44.000648,Richelle,But I don't see anything from the old iterations so I assumed it was getting cleared or something at some point
1369,2017-11-08T14:54:40.000486,Richelle,This is the most likely explanation I think
1369,2017-11-08T14:55:00.000231,Richelle,thanks for the help <@Meg> :slightly_smiling_face:
1370,2017-11-08T20:58:46.000044,Jazmine,How do I check if a beautifulSoup item has any children?
1370,2017-11-08T21:01:42.000077,Meg,`findAll(tag_name)` returns a list
1370,2017-11-08T21:02:46.000035,Meg,<https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#find-all>
1370,2017-11-08T21:04:23.000158,Jazmine,I have data where there are `&lt;p&gt;`  tags will be present sometimes with children and some times without children.
1370,2017-11-08T21:04:40.000096,Jazmine,If there are children I want to get them else get the original tag
1370,2017-11-08T21:04:50.000061,Meg,"unfortunately, there’s no `has_child` method in BS"
1370,2017-11-08T21:04:56.000162,Jazmine,Will findall work even if I have no children
1370,2017-11-08T21:04:56.000250,Meg,you’ll have to test for it
1370,2017-11-08T21:05:46.000117,Jazmine,Ok
1370,2017-11-08T21:53:58.000007,Jazmine,`soup.find_all()&gt;1`  seems to work
1370,2017-11-08T22:12:06.000043,Jazmine,I guess I could do `sound.find()` and get the siblings
1370,2017-11-08T22:15:24.000105,Jazmine,But I'm having difficulty in finding a way to loop through all siblings
1370,2017-11-08T22:25:20.000147,Jazmine,NVM .nextSibling is not working
1370,2017-11-08T22:39:52.000191,Jazmine,"NVM did
```

1370,2017-11-08T22:40:19.000064,Jazmine,Wouldn't that give the lowest elements and not the immediate children as I would want?

1370,2017-11-08T22:41:02.000026,Jazmine,Had to remove head body and the extra div though. lol
1370,2017-11-08T22:45:09.000044,Gisele,I think soup.body.children give you immediate children of body
1370,2017-11-08T22:48:33.000191,Jazmine,Thanks. It is `soup.body.div.children` for me
1370,2017-11-08T23:12:46.000228,Jazmine,I'm getting navigable string error
1370,2017-11-08T23:12:56.000013,Jazmine,My original code however works

1370,2017-11-08T23:42:41.000091,Jazmine,It seems BS4 was auto converting some empty elements into navigable strings
1370,2017-11-08T23:43:04.000117,Jazmine,Which were raising exceptions on printing

1373,2017-11-09T00:54:19.000026,Jazmine,Looks it is so
1373,2017-11-09T00:54:28.000010,Jazmine,Since it is an empty list
1373,2017-11-09T01:55:07.000164,Jazmine,I have the following code. It's not appending anything to the end list
1373,2017-11-09T01:55:27.000222,Jazmine,"I don't know why, but the list is empty"
1373,2017-11-09T02:07:53.000171,Jazmine,Seems the answer finding regex is wrong
1373,2017-11-09T02:20:56.000131,Jazmine,Works now. Changed the function order
1373,2017-11-09T02:21:18.000175,Jazmine,Seems the `answer_found` `elif` was never called

1375,2017-11-09T06:23:31.000414,Meg,huh?  I think you better restructure your question because it makes no sense
1375,2017-11-09T06:23:37.000147,Fabiola,`a = eval(a)`
1375,2017-11-09T06:23:45.000055,Fabiola,Not advised
1375,2017-11-09T06:23:56.000030,Fabiola,But is that what you want?
1375,2017-11-09T06:23:58.000018,Meg,"I mean, you can do that, but highly not advised, as <@Fabiola> said"
1375,2017-11-09T06:24:10.000050,Meg,"in other words, avoid at all costs :smile:"
1375,2017-11-09T06:24:49.000365,Fabiola,"Why do you have these variables are what is your objective, <@Georgeann>?"
1375,2017-11-09T06:27:55.000060,Vada,alternative solution which does not use `eval`
1375,2017-11-09T06:28:02.000012,Vada,`json.loads(a)`
1375,2017-11-09T06:28:05.000237,Georgeann,"I got something data from csv. 
think how to get keys from json."
1375,2017-11-09T06:28:28.000041,Vada,<@Georgeann> are you using pythons in built csv library?
1375,2017-11-09T06:29:02.000253,Georgeann,yes
1375,2017-11-09T06:29:28.000344,Vada,so one of your columns has data that looks like an array?
1375,2017-11-09T06:31:10.000019,Fabiola,<@Georgeann> This. Do this. Don't use `eval`.
1375,2017-11-09T06:32:07.000010,Georgeann,<@Vada> I think json.loads solved my problem

1375,2017-11-09T06:37:45.000181,Georgeann,why `eval` is evil?
1375,2017-11-09T06:37:55.000050,Vada,Because it is arbitrary code execution

1375,2017-11-09T06:38:52.000085,Vada,you are analysing CSVs so this is very much the case

1375,2017-11-09T06:42:06.000003,Vada,so you get validation (fails if not an appropriate entry)

1375,2017-11-09T06:42:42.000031,Vada,<@Georgeann> they could write a windows specific command as well

1379,2017-11-09T09:29:37.000509,Mirian,"Hi, I'm trying to make script compatible with multiple versions of the application. The newest version adds delete method to one of the classes. So I've created a fallback function that accepts the instance of that class and manually perform the actions. I am thinking of using it this way ```        delete_func = getattr(foo, ""delete"", _fallback_delete_function)
        delete_func()``` but it of course complains about `missing required positional argument`. Is there an easy way to attach that instance as the argument?"
1379,2017-11-09T09:32:03.000109,Ciera,`delete_func(foo)`
1379,2017-11-09T09:32:29.000309,Ciera,I believe would work
1379,2017-11-09T09:32:41.000649,Mirian,"in both cases, right?"
1379,2017-11-09T09:32:53.000335,Ciera,if `self` is the first arg yeah
1379,2017-11-09T09:33:44.000295,Mirian,"actually not, when the method is found it complains that it `takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`"
1379,2017-11-09T09:33:59.000713,Mirian,but works for the fallback function
1379,2017-11-09T09:34:30.000276,Ciera,hmm yeah my bad
1379,2017-11-09T09:34:45.000185,Ciera,`_fallback_delete_function` is not part of the class ?
1379,2017-11-09T09:35:01.000566,Mirian,pure function with one argument
1379,2017-11-09T09:35:44.000073,Ciera,the lazy way would be `delete_func(instance=foo)` and in `delete` just discard `instance`
1379,2017-11-09T09:36:27.000093,Ciera,of do an `if` / `else` with `delete_func(foo)` `delete_foo()` depending of the case

1380,2017-11-09T12:31:51.000119,Lory,Is there a way to take a string representing a date and convert it into an output like you would with strftime without first having to call strptime to then pass to strftime?

def perform_task(atom):
    time_consuming_task…

def main():
    atom_list = [,,,,,] #around 10000 items list
     with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=12) as executor:
          executor.map(perform_task, atom_list)

I’d like to handling over 10,000 task in parallel using ProcessPoolExecutor
However I have noticed that memory consumption has been increasing significantly, 
there are a lot of python processes alive even though perform_task function completed.

questions, is there any way to avoid memory consumption when it comes to multiprocessing ?
and.. all of python processes (10,000) are going to be alive until program termination ?
(is there any way to clean up process when the task is done ?) 

thanks in advance ."
1384,2017-11-10T03:30:58.000334,Collette,<@Hubert> if you have 10k processes then you're doing something wrong. In the snipped above you have `max_workers=12` which means there can be only 12 processes
1384,2017-11-10T03:31:22.000166,Collette,each process is going to perform the task on 10000/12 items from the list

reg = Auth()

device = Device()
d_name = device.generate_name()
d_pass = device.generate_password(20)

print(reg.register(d_name, d_pass, device.config.read('SECRET_KEY')))
```"
1389,2017-11-10T12:48:36.000598,Janella,the register function executes before the generate functions are done doing what they need to do
1389,2017-11-10T12:57:11.000379,Janella,"sorry when its like this ```print(reg.register(device.config.read('NAME'), device.config.read('PASSWORD'), device.config.read('SECRET_KEY')))```"
1389,2017-11-10T13:02:46.000243,Janella,I've been wokring on this all day and cant figure out why it behaves this way
1389,2017-11-10T13:07:05.000377,Antionette,"For context, what libraries are Auth() and Device() coming from?"
1389,2017-11-10T13:08:23.000360,Janella,they're classes I wrote
1389,2017-11-10T13:08:54.000030,Janella,the auth class has some post and get methods
1389,2017-11-10T13:09:39.000096,Janella,and the device class writes to a config file locally. I can upload a code snippet if it helps
1389,2017-11-10T13:11:23.000364,Meg,are the name and password generators asynchronous?
1389,2017-11-10T13:12:29.000557,Janella,I don't think. they are pretty simple loops
1389,2017-11-10T13:14:23.000156,Janella,I'm very much a noob python programmer. So some of the stuff im doing might not make too much snese in the python world
1389,2017-11-10T13:18:40.000517,Meg,alright.
1389,2017-11-10T13:18:45.000162,Meg,nothing pops out at me
1389,2017-11-10T13:19:17.000048,Meg,"what I would do is add more print lines or logging statements in `Config.read`, and `Auth.register`"
1389,2017-11-10T13:20:25.000253,Fabiola,"I agree with dd82. Add print lines between each func call, just too see what's happening"
1389,2017-11-10T13:20:31.000438,Meg,what it seems to me is you’re including the configuration read ops as part of the authentication call
1389,2017-11-10T13:21:52.000383,Meg,"I wonder if this has the same effect:

```
username = device.config.read('NAME')
password = device.config.read('PASSWORD')
key = device.config.read('SECRET_KEY')

registration = reg.register(username, password, key)
print(registration)
```"
1389,2017-11-10T13:22:09.000132,Janella,"I'll give it a try. when I run the code in through the debugger and step throught it, it runs fine. I'll add some prints and see what happens"
1389,2017-11-10T13:22:29.000033,Meg,how are you executing it when the errors happen?
1389,2017-11-10T13:23:04.000020,Janella,python script_name.py in the console
1389,2017-11-10T13:23:21.000265,Meg,"hmm, ok"
1389,2017-11-10T13:25:03.000256,Janella,its like theres some async operation
1389,2017-11-10T13:25:41.000385,Janella,"```
username = device.config.read('NAME')
password = device.config.read('PASSWORD')
key = device.config.read('SECRET_KEY')

registration = reg.register(username, password, key)
```"
1389,2017-11-10T13:25:50.000009,Janella,like that it works
1389,2017-11-10T13:26:33.000208,Janella,w/e I'll stick with it.
1389,2017-11-10T13:37:19.000641,Meg,hmm
1389,2017-11-10T13:37:36.000218,Meg,"so, what I suspect is the root cause is calling `reg.register()` in a `print` method"
1389,2017-11-10T13:40:18.000209,Meg,"because as the documentation says 

&gt;All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does

<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print>"
1389,2017-11-10T13:40:58.000205,Meg,"so what I suspect is the `str()` call is evaluating `reg.register()` first, before the actual arguments are evaluated"
1389,2017-11-10T13:55:49.000249,Janella,ohh i see.
1389,2017-11-10T13:56:05.000511,Janella,I'll keep that in mind going forward
1390,2017-11-10T17:39:20.000178,Antionette,Is it printing anything from the statement on line 12?
1390,2017-11-10T17:41:43.000206,Antionette,"But you probably would need to do `len(d.entries)` instead of just `len(d)`.  However the more ""pythonic"" way would be to just iterate through the links instead of indexing"
1390,2017-11-10T17:41:58.000102,Antionette,like `for entry in d.entries`
1390,2017-11-10T17:47:21.000271,Enid,"It's not printing anything from either print statement, but it was working prior to wrapping it in a function"
1390,2017-11-10T17:48:11.000108,Antionette,Did you double check the length of `d`?
1390,2017-11-10T17:49:03.000015,Enid,"I just changed that to ""for entry in d.entries"" and it still doesn't print anything."
1390,2017-11-10T17:49:48.000184,Antionette,Hmmm if you print d.entries before line 9 what is in it?
1390,2017-11-10T17:50:59.000129,Antionette,Unfortunately I'm not familiar with the library if that's the issue but assuming that `d.entries` is enumerable and contains some elements then print statement inside the loop should be executing
1390,2017-11-10T17:53:02.000021,Antionette,So just try iterating over d directly instead of entries?
1390,2017-11-10T17:53:10.000073,Enid,I will try that
1390,2017-11-10T17:55:46.000040,Enid,"Tried it, didn't change it. At this point I'm just gonna say screw it and write all of the loops to append to my URL list  (since I have 4 RSS feed URLs) instead of doing it the 'right' way and using a function."

1391,2017-11-10T18:28:53.000035,Bruno,"So, at work we have a lot of apps/services each with their own `.env` files, a few repos have multiple. So naturally some of them have the same env variables. Which, can get convoluted. We use salt to set all the ENV's when deploying on production/staging but locally, its kind of a mess. 

What do you guys use, if any, to keep different versions of ENV vars in sync between apps based on the environment (prod, staging, dev)? I was considering proposing something like consul but not sure if theres anything simpler. It should be something that all the devs could easily setup and use."

Is there a way I can convert the millisecond timestamp straight to UTC or whatever preferred timezone? Or do i need to create the datetime object first, and then do it from that?"
1397,2017-11-11T23:12:50.000069,Wonda,where ``` ms = 1510350300027```
1397,2017-11-12T00:20:48.000049,Wonda,"OK, I found a way to do it. Not sure if it's the 'right' way, but if I create a timedelta object i.e.  ```td = datetime.timedelta(hours=11)``` I can then minus that from the original. to get the UTC time. Alternatively I can use datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(ms/1000.0) and then add that timedelta object. Both work. Just not sure if its the right way to go."
1397,2017-11-12T00:28:11.000018,Bruno,"<@Wonda> a timestamp has no notion of timezone. so it is in whatever timezone you are in essentially. though if you know you got it from someone with a -8 timezone, you could adjust it that way. without plugins, you could do what you did then change the time delta. But i would checkout the `pytz` module. it makes working with dates a bit easier across time zones too."
1397,2017-11-12T01:15:34.000034,Wonda,<@Bruno> cool. will check out pytz. It seems when it comes to times/dates there are many different ways to do things!

1402,2017-11-12T15:49:25.000077,Leanna,"Hey Peeps,
Have a question, I am parsing some json which looks like the following:
```
[{""id"": 0, ""title"": ""AAABBBCCC""}
{""id"": 1, ""title"": ""SSSBBBEEE""}
{""id"": 2, ""title"": ""KKKBBBFFF""}
{""id"": 3, ""title"": ""KKKFFFGGG""}]
```
This is stored as a simple list containing multiple dictionary objects. From here, my next step is to find an algorithm of some sort that can traverse through each title key in each dictionary and find similar or exact matches. If there are more than one matches or similar titles, then put the matches into a family, eventually yielding a set of family objects containing the matched tiles. With this in mind, if I execute the json listed above I expect to return:
```
['Set A': {""id"": 0, ""title"": ""AAABBBCCC""}
{""id"": 1, ""title"": ""AAABBBEEE""}] ,

['Set B': {""id"": 2, ""title"": ""KKKBBBFFF""}
{""id"": 3, ""title"": ""KKKFFFGGG""}]
```
Where both sets A &amp; B contain dictionaries where the title key values can be found by a) finding approximate substring matches inside a given string and b) finding dictionary strings that match the pattern approximately. I am thinking of incorporating an adaptation of some fuzzy matching algorithm, such as the Levenshtein distance Algorithm, but feel I could make this a lot simpler, does anyone have any alternative suggestions or ideas for me to look up? Would appreciate it greatly."
1402,2017-11-12T17:10:51.000049,Meg,"what I would do is make a class, and add in the id and title to the class on init.  Implement your comparison algorithm as a method.  eg, `def levenshtein` that takes in a string and returns the edit distance"
1402,2017-11-12T17:11:20.000091,Meg,"so you can initialize a list of instances, and then filter it by the result of the edit distances"
1403,2017-11-12T23:32:52.000140,Louie,So trying to install pip but was directed to download get-pip.py does it matter where I run that? It says I should have it installed (I am running Python 3) but tried to run a module install in cmd and nothing happened.
1403,2017-11-13T04:58:32.000253,Fabiola,"Hi <@Louie>, are you still having issues?"
1404,2017-11-13T03:57:18.000253,Vada,"<@Charisse> I don't know of any package which integrates react with django directly, are you trying to make a SPA? or is it for smaller parts of the site?"

1406,2017-11-13T10:08:28.000442,Ciera,maybe the connection is just hanging. I have no idea if `paramiko` is built to handle these types of files transfer
1406,2017-11-13T10:08:50.000621,Chaya,works fine with scp
1406,2017-11-13T10:11:45.000844,Junita,28MB isn’t very big though.  are you sure any data at all is being transferred?  Are you seeing the first 28MB of the file on the remote server or something?
1406,2017-11-13T10:13:05.000238,Junita,"also, do you see anything of interest when turning on logging?"

1406,2017-11-13T10:15:16.000325,Junita,I am pretty sure `import logging; logging.getLogger('paramiko').setLevel(logging.WARN)` will work
1406,2017-11-13T10:15:42.000032,Ciera,you can even put it on `DEBUG` directly
1406,2017-11-13T10:15:43.000170,Junita,"sorry, thats `WARNING`"
1406,2017-11-13T10:16:31.000570,Chaya,"Ok, checking it right now"
1406,2017-11-13T10:16:51.000300,Junita,"or I guess ramp it up to debug, although I’d hope it’d print some sort of error message if it were having a problem"

1411,2017-11-13T17:10:28.000567,Marcelina,What is the preferred method of running gunicorn inside a docker container?
1411,2017-11-13T17:11:18.000289,Marcelina,I'm using flask + gunicorn atm
1411,2017-11-13T17:12:56.000174,Marcelina,It seems ridiculous to add so many moving parts
1411,2017-11-13T17:13:00.000561,Marcelina,When gunicorn just works
1411,2017-11-13T17:21:39.000571,Marilyn,<@Marcelina>  There is no `systemctl` but there is `service`
1411,2017-11-13T17:21:56.000084,Marcelina,"Right, so I could make gunicorn a service I suppose"
1411,2017-11-13T17:23:45.000222,Marilyn,You should be able to do something similar to `service gunicorn start`. Usually when I'm building containers that require a service to run at the beginning (such as apache or nginx) I will add a `entry.sh` script which will contain the service start command and use that as the entrypoint for the image
1411,2017-11-13T17:24:07.000620,Marcelina,Right - hmm - I think I've been overcomplicating
1411,2017-11-13T17:24:10.000124,Marcelina,gimme a minute
1411,2017-11-13T17:24:11.000209,Marcelina,:slightly_smiling_face:
1411,2017-11-13T17:24:17.000431,Meg,easy to do that :smile:
1411,2017-11-13T17:31:57.000266,Marcelina,"That works for the most part, some weird stuff"
1411,2017-11-13T17:32:08.000413,Marcelina,"On localhost, I don't want to rewrite to SSL"
1411,2017-11-13T17:32:40.000073,Marcelina,But I'm getting a redirect to the primary domain even through gunicorn is showing 200s rather than 301s
1411,2017-11-13T17:32:41.000095,Marcelina,hrms
1411,2017-11-13T17:32:57.000236,Marcelina,Ugh
1411,2017-11-13T17:32:59.000316,Marcelina,I hate caching

For my friend this throws the error ""int is not callable"" at line 9, using Python 3.4.5.
When I run the code in Python 3.6.1 I don't get an error.
Is this a problem with the compiler?"
1413,2017-11-13T18:13:40.000167,Myong,Has anyone used DPKT before?
1413,2017-11-13T18:21:27.000383,Myong,basically attempting to read a giant .pcap that is zipped
1413,2017-11-13T18:42:16.000269,Thomasina,Anyone have any idea? :thinking_face:
1413,2017-11-13T18:43:16.000111,Collette,<@Thomasina> there's no `int()` on line 9
1413,2017-11-13T18:44:02.000201,Collette,I assume your friend re-assigned `str` or (much likely) `len` to a number above that snippet
1413,2017-11-13T18:55:42.000173,Cammy,<@Thomasina> the code is working__ no errors.. perhaps your friend fixed the error..
1413,2017-11-13T19:00:46.000162,Riva,I'm 90% sure it just returns the month
1413,2017-11-13T19:04:53.000228,Riva,it does. thx legacy code
1413,2017-11-14T05:57:17.000505,Ciera,<@Myong> <https://github.com/otherwiseguy/yappcap>
1413,2017-11-14T05:57:53.000501,Ciera,(not sure what it's worth)
1414,2017-11-14T04:22:55.000389,Vada,"<@Thomasina> as <@Collette> says, your friend probably reassigned it to something else."
1415,2017-11-14T07:01:40.000154,Wonda,"I'm currently using the 'reprint' module to print and update text in place. However, when I add escape codes for colors i.e. output[0] = '\033[94m' + ""some text"" it's messing up the formatting of the text ( lines are wrapping + all sorts of ugliness ). if i remove the escape codes for color, all is perfect. Anyone familiar with reprint and/or coloring text in the terminal that could shed some light on why it might be behaving this way?"
1415,2017-11-14T07:59:57.000106,Wonda,"gah, figured it out. Ansi escape sequences add to the length of the string but don't have characters, so throws out the alignment."

1416,2017-11-14T08:17:42.000005,Carroll,Yea it's very strange
1416,2017-11-14T08:17:50.000248,Carroll,It works fine for GET methods
1416,2017-11-14T08:17:57.000507,Carroll,It doesn't let me POST from JS though
1416,2017-11-14T08:18:01.000227,Carroll,Using Postman is fine
1416,2017-11-14T08:20:49.000094,Toby,but postman (from my experience) can self add headers and things to make it compatible
1416,2017-11-14T08:20:56.000258,Carroll,Yea
1416,2017-11-14T08:25:19.000467,Carroll,Doesn't let me

1416,2017-11-14T08:40:46.000144,Carroll,Doesn't work :disappointed:
1416,2017-11-14T08:41:14.000100,Meg,can you confirm the header is actually set?

1416,2017-11-14T08:42:06.000526,Carroll,It's not
1416,2017-11-14T08:49:35.000084,Carroll,Hmm why isn't it set
1416,2017-11-14T08:53:42.000065,Carroll,Don't think so
1416,2017-11-14T08:54:05.000362,Suellen,set it before adding resources
1416,2017-11-14T08:54:11.000066,Carroll,Did

1416,2017-11-14T08:55:12.000591,Carroll,Will test that little snippet you gave me there :stuck_out_tongue:
1416,2017-11-14T08:55:34.000038,Suellen,"&gt; If things aren’t working as you expect, enable logging to help understand what is going on under the hood, and why.

1416,2017-11-14T09:00:32.000652,Carroll,I'll check this out later
1416,2017-11-14T09:01:28.000512,Suellen,"&gt; Not sure what or why
Well try to debug it, guesses will only take you so far"
1416,2017-11-14T09:08:39.000195,Carroll,Ye
1417,2017-11-14T08:52:55.000515,Suellen,does it work at least locally?

1418,2017-11-14T12:22:05.000320,Ciera,I think they discontinued hangouts API
1419,2017-11-14T13:30:19.000555,Chong,Getting the following error message from Apashe httpd upon upload request page. I see that it is getting the wrong keyword in the connector for upload but the __init__ but having issues locating the __init__ for uploads. I am able to see that on the Server the files are being uploaded to the directory. Anyone have any good pointers?
1420,2017-11-14T15:14:35.000413,Myong,"Hey guys, I got a quick and probably simple issue at the moment. I'm writing a program to process .pcapng files to look at the packet data. The program has time frames which are given a timeout time. This timeout time is checked every time a new packet is read. The issue I'm having is, the .pcapng `timestamp` gives a pretty long float value which equates to a date obviously. For some reason, even after setting the timeout to also be a float, the loop goes a bit further than it should. The first packet in the timeframe sets the next time frame variable so that when `next_time_frame &lt;= timestamp` (this is the check I do every time a new packet comes in) a new next_time_frame is set and a I do other things. So for example if the first timestamp is 1385856000.00000, then `next_time_frame` would be 1385856060.00000, but for some reason, the loop doesn't stop when that statement is true."
1420,2017-11-14T15:14:51.000091,Myong,So basically comparing two floats to each other isn't working properly
1420,2017-11-14T15:19:59.000061,Myong,Nevermind it works now.
1420,2017-11-14T15:20:05.000299,Marilyn,:thumbsup:
1421,2017-11-14T15:19:46.000266,Marilyn,have you tried using `Decimal`?
1422,2017-11-14T16:20:06.000187,Bruno,Thoughts on this? Like what they mention about gotchas in the comments? <https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/7cwsbv/til_python_package_metadata_can_be_defined_in/>
1422,2017-11-14T16:23:03.000341,Bruno,Seems like the discussed side effects about sdists wouldn't be an issue if your not making a general library but more of a plug-in setup where each plug-in ( like for Django or flask) is a module. 
1423,2017-11-14T16:36:41.000328,Lory,can I pass in a tuple of ints to `sorted` as the `key` to sort by?
1423,2017-11-14T16:37:24.000573,Suellen,how would this work?
1423,2017-11-14T16:39:26.000439,Lory,"I have a list of dicts and each dict has a filename made of some identifier followed by a date, I want to group them together in ascending order first by their id, then their year, then their month and then their day so I am using a regex to split the various pieces up into groups and then saving those out as a tuple where `None` becomes 0"
1423,2017-11-14T16:39:30.000655,Lory,if that makes sense?
1423,2017-11-14T16:40:36.000208,Lory,"that tuple is then used as the key, ie ` rows = sorted(files, key=lambda k:k['parsed'])`"
1423,2017-11-14T16:41:08.000191,Lory,"where `files` is just a dict with a filename, a parsed filename and a flag for if it's on disk or not"

Is that OK ?"
1425,2017-11-15T03:38:51.000040,Ciera,We prefer people to post in the most relevant channel (<#C0LMFRMB5|django> in this case) and if you don't get any response after a while share your message in channels with a wider audience. And we try to push people to use the share feature so there is no two simultaneous discussion as it links to your initial message :slightly_smiling_face:

1427,2017-11-15T07:24:10.000203,Carroll,Have anyone here worked with bcrypt and postgres? I'm having trouble storing my hashed &amp; salted password in my postgres database using SQLAlchemy
1427,2017-11-15T07:24:33.000001,Carroll,"Heroku logs aren't showing any useful info, works locally with sqlite3 though."
1427,2017-11-15T07:25:11.000202,Suellen,it's best to replicate your production locally
1427,2017-11-15T07:25:25.000158,Suellen,i.e. use postgres for dev too
1427,2017-11-15T07:25:49.000442,Carroll,I think it's a problem with the data type
1427,2017-11-15T07:25:56.000261,Carroll,Right now I'm using string
1427,2017-11-15T07:25:58.000029,Suellen,"sqlite is very different, some thing might work in dev and not in prod, and others work in prod and not in dev"
1427,2017-11-15T07:26:28.000189,Carroll,I see that some people say here that you should convert the password bytes to a string first
1427,2017-11-15T07:26:33.000272,Carroll,Or using BYTEA
1427,2017-11-15T07:26:43.000208,Carroll,"""I had a similar problem and I solved it using BYTEA data type at the Postgresql. I think problem occurs while writing byte array into VARCHAR datatype in Postgre. This might be related to database encoding and the details of that conversion from byte to varchar."""
1427,2017-11-15T07:26:48.000061,Carroll,Could that be it?
1427,2017-11-15T07:26:52.000154,Suellen,I use db.String(64) or something
1427,2017-11-15T07:26:59.000386,Suellen,algorithm is bcrypt too
1427,2017-11-15T07:27:01.000137,Joann,Storing as bytea would almost certainly be more efficient.
1427,2017-11-15T07:27:24.000138,Suellen,<@Joann> even if `bcrypt(something)` is a string?
1427,2017-11-15T07:27:26.000030,Joann,"Unfortunately, not all client libraries make that very easy."
1427,2017-11-15T07:27:35.000206,Carroll,That's my usermodel
1427,2017-11-15T07:27:48.000047,Carroll,Then I have a db.py file
1427,2017-11-15T07:28:03.000376,Joann,"leovp: well, you'd ideally want to have it be a binary string since that's going to be smaller than a binary-string-encoded-as-text"
1427,2017-11-15T07:28:13.000066,Carroll,and for making heroku work:
1427,2017-11-15T07:29:23.000223,Suellen,"<@Joann> that's true, but unfortunately even low-level `bcrypt` returns a readable ascii string (or a bytes object, but still 2x the size)"
1427,2017-11-15T07:29:41.000009,Suellen,and other higher level libraries just use what they have been given
1427,2017-11-15T07:30:10.000239,Suellen,"<@Carroll> looks ok, you really have to debug the issue itself"
1427,2017-11-15T07:30:27.000129,Carroll,Yea
1427,2017-11-15T07:30:30.000085,Suellen,i.e. what is the issue exactly?
1427,2017-11-15T07:30:39.000411,Carroll,"I'm not sure, when I try to run this snippet"
1427,2017-11-15T07:30:45.000062,Carroll,I have an endpoint /register
1427,2017-11-15T07:30:47.000311,Suellen,"your app complains about the password, or sqlalchemy? or underlying driver?"
1427,2017-11-15T07:31:09.000011,Joann,"leovp: which is terribly silly, really.  Still, you could at least save on-disk size by having the data type be a bytea and then sending the base64 or hex-encoded string to PG wrapped in a conversion function to turn it into a proper bytea."
1427,2017-11-15T07:31:14.000257,Carroll,It hits the exception block
1427,2017-11-15T07:31:21.000246,Carroll,What message can I get out of e?
1427,2017-11-15T07:31:25.000217,Carroll,e.message wouldn't work
1427,2017-11-15T07:31:53.000247,Suellen,"str(e), repr(e), anything really"
1427,2017-11-15T07:32:03.000179,Carroll,Alright
1427,2017-11-15T07:32:13.000283,Carroll,Will deploy it and see what problem it is
1427,2017-11-15T07:32:16.000185,Joann,"Wouldn't help with network traffic since you'd be sending the hex-encoded string over the wire instead of the binary data, but saving space on disk and in memory is certainly valuable from a database perspective."
1427,2017-11-15T07:32:17.000247,Suellen,otherwise it's really not clear
1427,2017-11-15T07:33:04.000274,Joann,"(the function you'd use for storing the data into a PG bytea would actually be 'decode', 'encode' would be used to pull the data back out)"
1427,2017-11-15T07:33:24.000073,Suellen,"<@Joann> I guess no one in Flask/Django/etc world sees it as an issue, because a password column is rarely even 10% of a table size.
Maybe top players like Instagram do care, but I don't know"
1427,2017-11-15T07:33:56.000041,Joann,"eh, it just grates against me when people store binary data as text because it's such a waste of space."
1427,2017-11-15T07:33:59.000220,Carroll,Uhm okey
1427,2017-11-15T07:34:00.000326,Carroll,dafuq
1427,2017-11-15T07:34:21.000150,Joann,The gitlab folks have made an effort to start storing their git hashes as bytea's because it really does make a difference in space.
1427,2017-11-15T07:34:30.000011,Suellen,I understand you entirely :))
1427,2017-11-15T07:34:30.000150,Carroll,oh my god
1427,2017-11-15T07:34:33.000117,Carroll,I think I get it
1427,2017-11-15T07:34:36.000052,Carroll,-.-
1427,2017-11-15T07:34:42.000379,Carroll,I'm a freaking idiot
1427,2017-11-15T07:34:42.000396,Suellen,:tada:
1427,2017-11-15T07:35:02.000312,Carroll,I changed the length of the db model
1427,2017-11-15T07:35:09.000161,Carroll,But never actually reset the heroku postgres database
1427,2017-11-15T07:35:14.000241,Carroll,......
1427,2017-11-15T07:35:24.000344,Carroll,Any of you got a rope so I can hang myself?
1427,2017-11-15T07:35:40.000159,Joann,"leovp: With enough rows, every byte matters. :)"
1427,2017-11-15T07:37:26.000394,Suellen,I guess you would want to know that I store IPs in INET :slightly_smiling_face:
1427,2017-11-15T07:37:39.000135,Suellen,"not as a string, which is _very_ common"
1427,2017-11-15T07:38:11.000318,Joann,"well, I'd probably recommend ip4r there"
1427,2017-11-15T07:38:19.000192,Joann,Though it depends on your requirements.
1427,2017-11-15T07:38:38.000146,Suellen,:open_mouth:
1427,2017-11-15T07:38:44.000429,Carroll,Would you look at that! It works :smile:
1427,2017-11-15T07:38:46.000241,Suellen,Let me just google it
1427,2017-11-15T07:39:25.000190,Carroll,"Right, now it's a problem with the auth :joy:"
1427,2017-11-15T07:39:30.000241,Suellen,<@Joann> is it in 10.0 or 9.x?
1427,2017-11-15T07:39:56.000293,Joann,leovp: <https://github.com/RhodiumToad/ip4r>
1427,2017-11-15T07:40:06.000231,Joann,It's an extension that works with lots of versions of PG
1427,2017-11-15T07:40:22.000058,Suellen,I see. It's a bit harder to pitch
1427,2017-11-15T07:40:38.000307,Joann,"Unlike inet, it segregates ip4 vs. ip6, but it's much more efficient at storage and allows more indexing options"
1427,2017-11-15T07:40:58.000062,Suellen,"I don't think INET is that bad currently, as we don't really perform operations on IPs frequently (or at all)"
1427,2017-11-15T07:40:59.000132,Joann,(an ip4 address is actually stored as a 32bit unsigned integer..)
1427,2017-11-15T07:41:47.000312,Suellen,"And we do have a bunch ipv6 addresses stored, which would require `ipaddress` which is probably not much better than `INET`"
1427,2017-11-15T07:42:16.000322,Suellen,"still, good to know :slightly_smiling_face:"
1427,2017-11-15T07:43:23.000447,Joann,"well, or you could store ipv6 addresses as ip6 :)"
1427,2017-11-15T07:43:30.000221,Joann,"but, yeah, definitely something good to know about"
1427,2017-11-15T07:43:36.000309,Joann,and it's quite stable and well maintained.
1427,2017-11-15T07:45:05.000194,Suellen,i.e. split each mixed IP columns into two?
1427,2017-11-15T07:45:09.000337,Suellen,that doesn't seem nice :confused:
1427,2017-11-15T07:46:56.000124,Suellen,or store ipv4 as a ipv6 as well? will postgres understand that `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:c0a8:10a` requires 4 bytes instead of 8?
1427,2017-11-15T07:50:45.000055,Carroll,Okey
1427,2017-11-15T07:51:01.000324,Carroll,<@Suellen> I'm really new to this crypto approach
1427,2017-11-15T07:51:12.000294,Carroll,This worked fine
1427,2017-11-15T07:51:39.000085,Carroll,Register now works
1427,2017-11-15T07:51:43.000317,Carroll,"But, if we look in auth"
1427,2017-11-15T07:52:24.000019,Carroll,"Without encoding both, I got an error saying they must be encoded"
1427,2017-11-15T07:52:36.000182,Carroll,"So I encoded both with utf8, and I got this error message"
1427,2017-11-15T07:53:25.000212,Suellen,hm
1427,2017-11-15T07:54:37.000267,Suellen,where is this exception from?
1427,2017-11-15T07:54:56.000445,Suellen,`bcrypt.checkpw` returns true or false
1427,2017-11-15T07:57:30.000385,Carroll,Exception is from the auth
1427,2017-11-15T08:04:28.000251,Joann,"leovp: no, PG would store an ipv6 address as an ipv6 address"
1427,2017-11-15T08:04:40.000250,Patty,"<@Carroll> since you are doing utf8 going into the db, you don’t need to re-encode it after pulling it from the db"
1427,2017-11-15T08:04:54.000330,Joann,"leovp: You could have different tables rather than different columns, though it depends on your exact data model, of course."
1427,2017-11-15T08:05:00.000029,Carroll,It raised an error when I tried to do that
1427,2017-11-15T08:05:05.000260,Carroll,Maybe I have to decode it?
1427,2017-11-15T08:05:15.000231,Joann,leovp: I will note that storing NULLs are basically free unless you're careful to not have any NULLs at all in your tuples.
1427,2017-11-15T08:05:30.000229,Joann,"(in which case, PG can avoid storing the NULL bitmap at all)"
1427,2017-11-15T08:08:09.000147,Carroll,<@Patty> I need that u?
1427,2017-11-15T08:10:15.000015,Suellen,"<@Joann> This is just a bit too different, storing different types of addresses separately. :confused:"
1427,2017-11-15T08:10:43.000248,Suellen,<@Carroll> I think the point was that `checkpw` doesn't raise an exception
1427,2017-11-15T08:11:04.000363,Patty,"No you don’t need the u, that’s just demonstrating it’s a Unicode string "
1427,2017-11-15T08:11:10.000227,Joann,"leovp: eh, they actually are disjoint tho, really, but if it works for you.. :)"
1427,2017-11-15T08:11:21.000280,Patty,Sorry trying to get a snippet over but I’m in the middle of switching trains :)
1427,2017-11-15T08:11:30.000133,Carroll,Hehe
1427,2017-11-15T08:11:35.000076,Carroll,I am using Heroku with Postgres though
1427,2017-11-15T08:12:05.000091,Patty,Are you still encoding the password before putting it in the dB?
1427,2017-11-15T08:12:08.000461,Carroll,I am
1427,2017-11-15T08:12:26.000367,Patty,And did you clear out the original hashed value that wasn’t encoded?
1427,2017-11-15T08:12:47.000324,Carroll,I did this
1427,2017-11-15T08:15:03.000013,Patty,Right but did you re-create the stored pw with that code?
1427,2017-11-15T08:15:22.000309,Carroll,Yes
1427,2017-11-15T08:15:27.000235,Carroll,I registered a new user
1427,2017-11-15T08:16:40.000271,Carroll,Trying auth

1427,2017-11-15T08:20:27.000579,Patty,And just to check you redeployed your heroku app with the changes for creating hashes?
1427,2017-11-15T08:28:51.000497,Carroll,I did
1428,2017-11-15T07:52:58.000443,Carroll,Am I doing something obviously wrong here? :slightly_smiling_face:
1428,2017-11-15T07:57:37.000141,Carroll,the bcrypt.checkpw
1429,2017-11-15T09:15:10.000716,Season,"Hi, Python newbie here with probably a dumb question...  I am trying to use the Google API examples to get some code running that will send an email from my app since port 587 is blocked on the company network.  I am very close but I am running into some issues where the example code has included some logic for backwards compatibility with python 2.6.    I get compile errors because the syntax is incorrect inside an IF block.  I am coding on OSX with Python 2.7 and my IDE is LiClipse.
Here is the code in question and I get an error on the third line from the bottom where it wants ""tools.run(flow, store)"" to be ""tools.run_flow(flow, store)"" 
```     if not credentials or credentials.invalid:
        flow = client.flow_from_clientsecrets(CLIENT_SECRET_FILE, SCOPES)
        flow.user_agent = APPLICATION_NAME
        if flags:
            credentials = tools.run_flow(flow, store, flags)
        else: # Needed only for compatibility with Python 2.6
            credentials = tools.run(flow, store)
        print('Storing credentials to ' + credential_path)
    return credentials  ```
Any Ideas for me?"
1429,2017-11-15T09:21:32.000286,Season,I went to get the compile error to post here and all of a sudden I am not getting an error on that line.  WTF?
1429,2017-11-15T09:27:52.000375,Meg,I guess my first question would be why support 2.6?
1429,2017-11-15T09:31:28.000070,Meg,"the last release of 2.6 was the .9 minor release back in 2013, and it hasn’t been supported since then"
1429,2017-11-15T09:37:44.000443,Tami,Does anyone here use Vim with YCM completer for Python?
1429,2017-11-15T09:38:21.000450,Tami,I can't get the YCM Jedi to pick up my virtual environment python interpreter :disappointed:
1429,2017-11-15T09:48:56.000008,Sirena,"well, if anyone is still running CentOS6, they've got 2.6"
1429,2017-11-15T09:49:59.000023,Sirena,"and it's semi-irritating to load a different version since the OS uses 'python' to run its package updater, and if it's not 2.6, it barfs."
1429,2017-11-15T09:50:42.000161,Sirena,I uh.... have a friend with that problem.... yeah.
1429,2017-11-15T09:51:19.000408,Vada,why would it not be 2.6?
1429,2017-11-15T09:57:51.000513,Meg,uhm that shouldn’t stop you from installing 2.7 or 3.x
1429,2017-11-15T09:58:15.000517,Meg,just leave system python alone and create virtualenvs mapped to the specific python interpreter version
1429,2017-11-15T10:06:52.000206,Jenise,running centos you can use the IUS repository (<https://ius.io/GettingStarted/>) to easily install python versions if you don't want to use the system default one

I am trying to wrap the process in a little python app. So far, what I have works. It is still in the beginning states and I am adding to it. My intention for the final version is that it will, from a gui, request input from the user, use that data to query sql, then dump the result in another gui window."
1429,2017-11-15T10:16:39.000262,Virgen,Am I headed in the right direction with this?
1429,2017-11-15T10:17:41.000520,Virgen,anything I should consider. This is more a learning exercise than anything else. I just hope to get a useful app out of it... Thoughts?
1429,2017-11-15T10:20:53.000767,Ciera,If it's working I would say your are on the right track :slightly_smiling_face:

1431,2017-11-15T12:38:09.000270,Meg,"there are two primary issues I have with it, but there really isn’t much you can do about it and really depends on the programs used for document creation"

1431,2017-11-15T12:42:25.000128,Antionette,<@Season> what have you tried so far using argparse to add the arguments?
1431,2017-11-15T12:49:38.000440,Season,"<@Antionette> I have just been googling and trying to combine the syntax in documents to what google provided but I honestly dont understand the code and the way each have been written dont match up.   For example I tried ot adapt parts of this example but I obviously didn't understand what I was doing because I coudlnt get it to work.  I have since thrown out my atttempts and put it back to how google had it so done really have specific examples of what I tried. ``` import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Process some integers.')
parser.add_argument('integers', metavar='N', type=int, nargs='+',
                   help='an integer for the accumulator')
parser.add_argument('--sum', dest='accumulate', action='store_const',
                   const=sum, default=max,
                   help='sum the integers (default: find the max)')

args = parser.parse_args()
print(args.accumulate(args.integers))  ```"
1431,2017-11-15T12:51:01.000022,Season,"I tried this portion with googles and it didnt work gave me errors. 

```  flags.add_argument('--sum', dest='accumulate', action='store_const',
                   const=sum, default=max,
                   help='sum the integers (default: find the max)') ```"
1431,2017-11-15T12:53:43.000473,Antionette,"What could have been the issue there is that `flags` refers to the parsed arguments rather than the parser itself since the google code you posted has the `parse_args` function being called directly on the `ArgumentParser` instance, whereas you need to call `add_argument` on the parser itself.  So you could save the `ArgumentParser` to its own parser variable, then add your custom arguments, and then call the `parse_args` yourself rather than in the spot its called in google's example"
1431,2017-11-15T13:21:47.000355,Season,<@Antionette> Thanks. Thats what I was trying to do but couldn't get it to work.  I decided to move on because calling it from bash isn't a requirement for today and I'm in a crunch.  When I get back to it I'll post my specific failing syntax.

1432,2017-11-15T14:04:42.000506,Lory,I don't have a decent understanding of how that all works and I'd rather learn more about it than just start doing something I don't fully understand
1432,2017-11-15T14:04:57.000214,Frieda,"you're not ever ""installing to pip"""
1432,2017-11-15T14:05:16.000450,Frieda,pip is a tool for putting external python packages into a place in your PYTHONPATH
1432,2017-11-15T14:06:59.000230,Frieda,i'm not sure of a good resource other than just looking up something like `pip install git`
1432,2017-11-15T14:07:37.000413,Lory,"That works, thanks for the help"
1432,2017-11-15T14:09:03.000408,Seema,<@Lory> <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#git>
1432,2017-11-15T14:09:53.000166,Lory,"Oh awesome, that's exactly what I needed"
1432,2017-11-15T14:10:49.000347,Seema,"I get all FOSS when I think of pip, it came to be to solve past issues, is in active development, isn't always the best, mostly does the trick, and one willll eventually run into an issue with it but one doesn't know until the tool doesn't do what is expected :slightly_smiling_face:"
1432,2017-11-15T14:11:55.000224,Frieda,"be careful with the `-e` flag, especially if you use docker"
1432,2017-11-15T14:12:18.000005,Seema,"To be clear, it is currently *the* install tool for python"
1432,2017-11-15T14:13:04.000068,Frieda,"i don't see it going away any time soon, especially once `Pipfile.lock` gets locked down"
1432,2017-11-15T14:13:23.000380,Lory,Yea I use it all the time ofr normal stuff within my virtualenv's I just have never packaged anything or gone farther than `pip install xyz`
1432,2017-11-15T14:13:50.000398,Lory,Trying to take my development ability a little farther and actually understand pythons packaging system
1432,2017-11-15T14:13:59.000168,Seema,"you'll ""should"" be fine, some of the other flags like -user can also get you in trouble too"
1432,2017-11-15T14:14:50.000243,Frieda,"`--user` is _usually_ pretty safe, at least on your local machine, assuming you're not using a virtualenv"
1432,2017-11-15T14:15:42.000394,Lory,is there ever a situation where you shouldn't use a virtualenv? Everything I've seen online says you should always use one
1432,2017-11-15T14:15:55.000657,Lory,with the exception of random test scripts at least
1432,2017-11-15T14:15:59.000764,Frieda,it makes no sense on single-purpose servers/containers
1432,2017-11-15T14:16:10.000465,Lory,Ah that does make sense
1432,2017-11-15T14:16:30.000065,Frieda,"it's kinda useless for anything you actually want system-wide (like, say, `flake8`)"
1433,2017-11-15T15:14:15.000242,Patty,it’s not invoking as it needs to be `if __name__ == '__main__'`
1433,2017-11-15T15:14:39.000689,Patty,it will error out then as `find_uncommon` isn’t defined
1434,2017-11-15T16:56:02.000490,Winnifred,Does anyone have experience decrypting files using `python-gnupg` on py3?
1435,2017-11-15T18:23:16.000151,Sirena,"When I create a `RawPacket(buf[0:8], buf[208:280])` I get ```TypeError: object.__init__() takes no parameters```"
1435,2017-11-15T18:23:51.000404,Sirena,"which, as far as I can tell, is usually because people spell __init__ wrong, but I think I did it right here, anyone have a suggestion?"
1435,2017-11-15T18:26:43.000287,Marcie,"weird, thats the normal super invocation"
1435,2017-11-15T18:26:46.000212,Marcie,python2 or 3?
1435,2017-11-15T18:26:50.000074,Sirena,2.7
1435,2017-11-15T18:30:29.000253,Sirena,"oh wow, I forgot to put the module name in front. I gotta stop debugging at the end of the day"
1435,2017-11-15T18:30:51.000125,Sirena,not sure how I ended up with that error tho
1435,2017-11-15T18:32:24.000111,Marcie,yeah that’s a bit of a mystery 
1436,2017-11-15T22:44:04.000109,Myong,What's up guys. I have a quick question. So I'm processing a large pcap file that so far has gone through 22 million packets. Now at some point the amount of data I need to collect is going to get way too large. I eventually have to store all the data I gather from this on a frontend webpage. Would sqlite be something to use?
1436,2017-11-15T22:56:29.000140,Marcie,<@Myong> generally depends on how you're going to be using the data itself
1436,2017-11-15T22:58:17.000110,Myong,So the idea is basically upload the data to a frontend (I'll probably use flask) and geolocate them using a database we've been given.
1436,2017-11-15T22:59:03.000134,Myong,the frontend is supposed to feature an interactive map
1436,2017-11-15T22:59:23.000072,Myong,Geolocating victims of DDoS attacks that is.
1436,2017-11-15T22:59:44.000163,Myong,"But for now, the file is so large I'm not sure how long it should actually take to go through the whole 8GB file..."
1436,2017-11-15T23:03:48.000098,Myong,So it takes about 1 minute 54 seconds to process 15 minutes worth of packets
1436,2017-11-15T23:04:47.000061,Marcie,off the top of my head i'd probably go for PostGresQL
1436,2017-11-15T23:05:03.000239,Marcie,+ postgis
1436,2017-11-15T23:05:55.000207,Myong,I'm just trying to figure out what the tables should look like
1436,2017-11-15T23:12:44.000102,Marcie,i usually try and put together a few user stories to try and map out my data tables
1436,2017-11-15T23:32:51.000120,Myong,<@Marcie> About to put together an example on paper and draw out what might be the best option.
1436,2017-11-15T23:54:56.000145,Myong,<@Marcie> Just drew this up. I have no clue if this is valid or a good diagram. But it gathers all the information I need
1437,2017-11-15T23:33:26.000061,Myong,My only concern is how detailed these things have to be. If all they need to be are IPs that map to locations and like 3 other columns of integers then it will be easy cause I can make a single table
1437,2017-11-15T23:37:26.000167,Myong,So the basic structure that I currently have in python is this.
1437,2017-11-15T23:57:23.000080,Myong,"Actually, realizing the circular reference is gonna be horrible. Scratch that table"
1437,2017-11-16T00:07:55.000131,Myong,Alternatively I could simply remove the Attack Time Frame since I can query the DDoS Victims table for timeframes between a specific time
1437,2017-11-16T00:22:51.000003,Myong,Guess this problem is a bit more difficult than I thought as far as what I know is concerned.
1438,2017-11-16T00:23:47.000113,Sebrina,"Hello!, i'm wonder if you know a good source to learn best practices with django... i dont know what to do, i mean, james benneth says its ok to have a lot of apps. but others say that we need to build our porject with few apps that do a bucnh of things... what do you think?"
1438,2017-11-16T00:39:18.000127,Genesis,I learned Django from Lynda after being taught Python and Flask.

1439,2017-11-16T02:57:08.000078,Jule,Looked up Lynda... website is pretty vague about their pricing.... is it expensive for an individual to take a course there ?
1439,2017-11-16T09:03:20.000704,Genesis,"<@Jule> um, its free if you use your library card number on <http://lynda.com|lynda.com>"
1439,2017-11-16T09:14:57.000078,Jule,"Ow.. I'm outside the US...  haha  :slightly_smiling_face:  Think... no dice for me  :stuck_out_tongue:
But... in your experience the courses were high quality ?"
1439,2017-11-16T09:15:55.000504,Jule,<@Oretha>: will check out that marinamele !  Thanks !
1439,2017-11-16T09:23:48.000195,Genesis,<http://Lynda.com|Lynda.com> is great. The videos are explained to detail and they show the source code. I was looking to use sessions and login on Django the way I used in Flask and I found a great video tutorial. I modeled my capstone project after it (somewhat...)
1439,2017-11-16T09:26:27.000261,Jule,"Well. .it's powered by LinkedIn... so it should be good. If the price is not too high I might still apply for the course.... 
Thanks for your advise !"

1441,2017-11-16T10:38:22.000757,Mallie,Docker noob question - I have my config setup (with a .env file) such that when I run `docker-compose config` I clearly see the host:container port mapping I want for ports `5431:5432/tcp` but when I start the service it invariably binds the 5432 port - what's the deal?
1441,2017-11-16T10:47:11.000708,Sade,hmmmm really?  that seems kind of odd for it to live “outside” of the else block it describes
1441,2017-11-16T10:47:38.000149,Sade,i guess the extra line break does group it along with it though
1441,2017-11-16T10:53:15.000302,Mallie,"I prefer <@Sade> second example, I'd never space between conditional blocks and don't think I ever have (and that is pep8 fine)"
1441,2017-11-16T10:56:03.000810,Bruno,on Ubuntu
1441,2017-11-16T10:56:38.000106,Sade,"if it’s down to personal preference though i’m probably going to go with what my boss asked for, which is the first example I posted"
1441,2017-11-16T10:57:01.000928,Sade,"if there’s specific language in pep8 about it he’d be more than happy to bow to that, but i don’t see it"
1441,2017-11-16T11:00:46.000123,Sade,yeah I totally agree with the latter.  And I agree about “sparingly” but that has a degree of subjectivity :slightly_smiling_face:
1441,2017-11-16T11:14:33.000221,Mallie,"I also dislike the first example <@Sade>, in this particular case"
1441,2017-11-16T11:14:49.000402,Mallie,Submit to their style :pray:
1441,2017-11-16T11:15:33.000050,Mallie,"That being said I don't think it is egregiously bad, even if it isn't the best"
1441,2017-11-16T11:16:01.000751,Sade,"well, my boss prefers the first one, but he’s not strongarming me about it.  I just like to go with the flow unless I can find a pep8 or other authoritative style guide backing me up, otherwise I assume it’s a matter of taste"
1441,2017-11-16T11:16:40.000390,Mallie,"In this situation it is taste, PEP8 has a preference, not a rule."
1441,2017-11-16T11:16:52.000320,Mallie,But you can spin that how you want :wink:
1441,2017-11-16T11:17:19.000921,Bruno,"i much prefer to stick to pep8, but even I dont stick to all the rules. line lenght for example."
1441,2017-11-16T11:17:42.000404,Bruno,"its nice to use it as a default, the tweak the things you need. that way you still have a set guideline"
1441,2017-11-16T11:33:43.000137,Donella,"I'm running into issues with Pandas when combining `.cut()` and `.count_value()` due to bins not actually being present as values in the data. 
The snippet below shows a workable example. Basically what I'm trying to get is a simple bar plot:
```
  |
  | |         |
|-----|-----|-----|
  A I   A I   A I
  0-10 10-20 20-30
```
The OS distributions are shown within percentage bins, and bins should be shown even if there's no data for them.
In the snippet I've used `pd.cut()` on the percentage data to get a nice categorical column. I group this data using `groupby` and then I want to get the counts for each OS using `value_counts()`. This is where the code crashes, seemingly because (in the sample data) only 4 out of 21 bins are actually present.
The results based on the rounded up data do show that in theory it does what I need it to.
Any way I can easily get around that crash?"
1441,2017-11-16T13:53:52.000167,Louis,"Side note: You want to use `==` with strings, not `is`, or you risk some very unexpected behaviour."
1441,2017-11-16T13:57:38.000080,Louis,"Explanation: `is` compares object identity, not equality, so it only works ""by accident"" in common paths when strings resolve to the same actual string object due to interning, and will break if you get strings through different paths."

```
if ticket_status is ""open"":

vs. this:

- is there a pep8 or other style guide link identifying which is better?"
1443,2017-11-16T10:55:56.000460,Bruno,anyone familiar with how I can connect to a named VPN (openvpn) network that shows in my NetworkManager VPN list from the cli?
1443,2017-11-16T10:59:51.000920,Patty,The big thing from PEP-8 what I gave as an example enforces the idea from the PEP to `use inline comments sparingly`
1443,2017-11-16T11:00:15.000252,Patty,"Also, IMO, doing it to extend the length of a row of logic flow reduces readability"
1443,2017-11-16T11:08:59.000036,Ronny,I think you are going to need to ~copy and edit~ extract the existing vpn-related part of your network in `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/your_name` to a file and then use `openvpn --config your_file`
1443,2017-11-16T11:14:43.000805,Mallie,But if you are being told what to do why even ask?
1443,2017-11-16T11:15:02.000323,Bruno,<@Ronny> yea i found some example on that. now trying to get the auth working
1444,2017-11-16T12:58:07.000079,Season,"quick question,  can someone explain the th [‘name’] at the end of this syntax works?  It works perfectly but I want to get the address data too and didnt wan to make a second api call because its slow.

1444,2017-11-16T13:05:13.000296,Meghan,Do you understand the rest of it?
1444,2017-11-16T13:06:21.000114,Meghan,That's a nice example of where f-strings make things easier to read.
1444,2017-11-16T14:06:40.000174,Season,<@Meghan> Yes up to that point I do. I’ll look up f-strings
1444,2017-11-16T14:08:24.000410,Season,"So say i wanted to do this in one line and one api call…

1444,2017-11-16T14:13:09.000249,Season,I can look it up. Im just not sure what this feature is called when the [‘name’] is added to the end of the line
1444,2017-11-16T14:13:38.000426,Jenise,"`json.loads` decodes json, so with your example you could do

1445,2017-11-16T16:15:25.000176,Lory,Python's datetime module has no concept of the current timezone when you instantiate a new datetime object with `datetime.now()` right?
1445,2017-11-16T16:18:06.000639,Suellen,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime

1445,2017-11-16T16:18:38.000013,Suellen,you can make it happen :slightly_smiling_face:
1445,2017-11-16T16:22:52.000182,Mirian,and what do you return from that Flask controller?
1445,2017-11-16T16:33:50.000553,Lory,Ah no I just realized it's pulling off the system time
1445,2017-11-16T16:34:14.000230,Lory,which my server was just set to the UTC timezone when it's located in New York
1445,2017-11-16T16:34:21.000408,Lory,Causing me a lot of confusion
1446,2017-11-16T16:43:32.000561,Bradly,"This may be a stupid question, but how do I keep homebrew on OS X from constantly installing python as a dependency? I already have python installed from anaconda."
1446,2017-11-16T16:49:45.000126,Bradly,"And - more generally - how do I clean up my Python install on Mac OS? I have no idea exactly how many versions of python I have installed on here, where they’re located, and how to remove all of them so I’m only left with the base Mac version, so I can start from a clean slate?"
1446,2017-11-16T16:54:44.000665,Lory,"I'm not sure about your first question, but as far as your second question, through the terminal you can type `which python` and `whereis python` while also using tab to auto complete differing versions to find out where they are installed globally. If you're using virtualenv's, those commands won't be able to pick up the venv's install paths unless you currently have them activated"
1446,2017-11-16T16:54:49.000054,Lory,that's where I would start at least
1446,2017-11-16T16:55:21.000377,Bradly,"I’m using raw bash - that should get around any virtualenv issues, yeah?"
1446,2017-11-16T16:55:44.000113,Bradly,by “raw” I mean just out-of-box bash.
1446,2017-11-16T16:56:00.000541,Lory,"virtualenv is independent of your shell, if you haven't personally installed any then they probably don't exist on your machine"
1446,2017-11-16T16:56:09.000324,Lory,in which case don't worry about them
1446,2017-11-16T16:56:22.000575,Bradly,"Ah. I don’t recall installing any - would some python tools (PyCharm, Anaconda, etc) install a virtualenv?"
1446,2017-11-16T16:56:47.000043,Bradly,"I’ve screwed around with Python on and off over time, and my system has accumulated a LOT of weird junk because of that."
1446,2017-11-16T16:56:54.000523,Lory,"honestly not sure, I would presume they probably do but you wouldn't want to mess with those unless you're also uninstalling the software that uses them"
1446,2017-11-16T16:57:28.000444,Lory,in which case you can probably just use OSX's uninstall stuff to delete the software and they'll clean up after themselves
1446,2017-11-16T16:57:32.000225,Bradly,I literally only have PyCharm installed - that’s the only Python IDE I have installed right now. And if I recall correctly I can set it to use whatever Python version I have installed.
1446,2017-11-16T16:57:42.000571,Lory,I have not used OSX in years so I'm not sure of the exact procedure for uninstalling software packages
1446,2017-11-16T16:57:58.000371,Bradly,"The problem is, I’ve done things like `brew install anaconda`, and OS X has no method to clean that up."
1446,2017-11-16T16:58:10.000337,Bradly,"With OS X, it’s drag package to trash, OS cleans everything else up."
1446,2017-11-16T16:58:20.000072,Lory,"I would start by deleting pycharm then, and then running those commands I sent earlier"
1446,2017-11-16T16:58:25.000171,Tandra,man brew is your friend
1446,2017-11-16T16:58:26.000163,Lory,someone else would probably know better though
1446,2017-11-16T16:58:58.000242,Lory,if you want to get rid of pycharm that is
1446,2017-11-16T16:59:00.000261,Mallie,"<#C6E28H1HV|os_mac> may be of assistance, can't say how active it is"
1446,2017-11-16T16:59:26.000003,Tandra,packages installed with brew can be uninstalled with brew and deps pruned etc
1446,2017-11-16T16:59:37.000021,Bradly,"I do want to use PyCharm - however, I don’t think it installs anything Python-related, just uses whatever’s on the system."
1446,2017-11-16T16:59:57.000238,Bradly,"I ran brew prune earlier, looks like I only have a pretty minimal set of brew packages installed right now."
1446,2017-11-16T17:01:49.000324,Bradly,"So apparently anaconda messes with .profile, the .bashrc equivalent on Mac"
1446,2017-11-16T17:03:45.000202,Bradly,"holy crap, I still have npm garbage on here."
1446,2017-11-16T17:04:56.000261,Mallie,"`.profile` is a UNIX thing, it's not Mac-specific, and it's not exactly equivalent to `.bashrc` in terms of history/what reads it"
1446,2017-11-16T17:05:38.000098,Mallie,"But unless you care, I wouldn't bother reading more than just knowing that for now"
1446,2017-11-16T17:06:21.000040,Bradly,you have no idea how much I care :smile:
1446,2017-11-16T17:06:29.000224,Mallie,lol
1446,2017-11-16T17:06:55.000213,Bradly,I legit am interested in getting elbows-deep in the Unix-y bits of MacOS
1446,2017-11-16T17:07:33.000008,Bradly,"I’m just not sure what bits are common to all Unixes and what bits are MacOS, which results in some confusion"
1446,2017-11-16T17:09:00.000079,Mallie,"And I don't know anything about OSX, so when I see something I do know, it's obviously UNIX/Linux"
1446,2017-11-16T17:09:07.000284,Bradly,there ya go!
1446,2017-11-16T17:09:51.000032,Bradly,"So if there’s something that a Unix/Linux person doesn’t recognize, e.g. a .DS_Store, that’s Mac stuff."
1446,2017-11-16T17:11:13.000004,Mallie,All I know about DS_Store is I sometimes get it in downloads and it makes me angry
1446,2017-11-16T17:11:14.000346,Mallie,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1446,2017-11-16T17:12:06.000351,Bradly,"it’s a Mac thing, I believe it contains tagging information for the Mac file system - equivalent to the Windows desktop.ini that pollutes everything."

1446,2017-11-16T17:14:19.000057,Frieda,probably. you should go ahead and ask your question instead of asking to ask :smile:

1448,2017-11-16T18:22:07.000052,Bradly,WTF. Why does bash think pip is in a non-existent directory
1448,2017-11-16T18:23:07.000189,Bradly,"I have /usr/local/bin/pip present, it works perfectly fine"
1448,2017-11-16T18:23:43.000292,Bradly,"for whatever reason, whenever I try to run pip, it defaults to the anaconda path"
1448,2017-11-16T18:23:54.000193,Bradly,oh nvm just had to restart bash :&gt;

The question I have is, how exactly should I deal with creating  and opening the session? Should I persist the connection through the whole time the program runs as well as the session object? Or should I close the session/connection when it's not needed?"
1449,2017-11-16T20:08:44.000235,Patty,"<@Myong> you should generally keep the connection open but as for sessions, it can vary. depends on if you want to use session vs. transaction scope, or sometimes its kept around the length of a transaction (say, a request on an API)"
1449,2017-11-16T20:09:02.000239,Patty,SQLAlchemy has a good writeup of making the decision for scoping sessions here: <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_basics.html#session-faq-whentocreate>
1449,2017-11-16T20:12:42.000081,Myong,I actually just finished reading that same article. Its pretty much what I thought but I wasn't too sure.
1449,2017-11-16T20:14:25.000164,Myong,"I am wondering though, should I instantiate the session in my `__init__.py` then use it from there or on creating of my main class object (which essentially manages the whole program) set something like `self.session = Session()`"
1449,2017-11-16T20:56:09.000001,Myong,<@Patty> The transactions seem like they'll probably be occurring every 1 second. Not sure how long it takes to do all the database inserts to add the objects as of yet. I'm just trying to figure out the best approach.

1451,2017-11-17T04:57:42.000127,Collette,"<@Ronny> the error isn't in `requests`, but (much likely) in your system-wide openssl"
1451,2017-11-17T04:58:08.000203,Junita,"yeah my guess might be openssl version, but it’s just a guess"
1451,2017-11-17T04:58:37.000180,Junita,"also - when you say “randomly” do you mean randomly within the same domain, or for random particular domains (so in that sense, not really randomly)"
1451,2017-11-17T04:59:30.000032,Ronny,"Randomly within the main domain...I say randomly because I download about 10-20 files with this code and it fails in a non-consistent manner; sometimes with the 5th or so, sometimes at the first, sometimes not at all"
1451,2017-11-17T05:01:46.000127,Ronny,"I also tend to favor your hypotheses regarding the specific openssl configuration (btw, it's just a regular ubuntu).
At my personal laptop, I tinker configurations here and there and I imagine that I had changed something that I shouldn't have from the openssl or ca-certificates packages
However, at this new machine that is now failing as well, I touch nothing, it's a regular Ubuntu 16.04 machine"
1451,2017-11-17T05:02:44.000103,Junita,what do your coworkers have?

1451,2017-11-17T08:33:27.000146,Meg,<@Ronny> you can tell requests to ignore ssl verification

1454,2017-11-17T09:05:41.000167,Virgen,I'll probably spend some time going through this `<https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world>` and using that as a jump off point for my app.
1454,2017-11-17T09:06:02.000115,Virgen,unless there is strong consensus that im better off going with django...
1454,2017-11-17T09:18:25.000269,Jaquelyn,"<@Virgen> i think it really depends what you're looking for. django is probably going to be easier to start out with, unless you've already got pretty strong python skills and web development experience with (insert large established framework here). i'd say there's more extensions, more tutorials, a livelier community around django. it's also got some established conventions for how things are done (more or less) and that can help a lot if you've got a team. all that said, flask is great - it lets you build exactly what you want without all the extra batteries you might not need. (but as your project gets bigger, i think you'll discover that actually hey a lot of those things are going to be needed, and you'll end up needing to research and integrate a solution in flask). but, you spend a month building up a flask app vs a django app, and while you'd probably get further on the django app, you're also going to have a much deeper understanding of how flask works compared to the ""magic"" of django"
1454,2017-11-17T10:19:23.000254,Virgen,"<@Jaquelyn> Thank you for the response. I think I might head the django direction. In short, I am looking to get as much functionality as quick as possible. I'm a Sys/Network/Storage ""Engineer"", wearing many hats means minimal time for any of them. So, with this, I want it to work as fast as possible. If there is some ""magic"" going on in the background, I am fine with that. I dont feel that I need the deep understanding, I just need to know enough to make it work plus a little bit more..."
1454,2017-11-17T11:02:03.000466,Junita,"<@Virgen> I think it’s probably best to ask what you are trying to do, that’ll be the larger determinator of which will help you do the most in the shortest amount of time"

1455,2017-11-17T11:11:00.000663,Arica,"Hi All! :wave: 
I have what I believe should be an easy task, but am having a rather difficult time understanding. It is regarding dependencies installed via `pip`.
I installed tensorflow a while back (version 1.0.0), but now want to upgrade to `1.1.0`. I have this code snippet (`tf_version.py`) that prints the current version of tensorflow:
```
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```
When I run `python tf_version.py` in the terminal I get `1.0.0`. However, when I run `pip uninstall tensorflow` I get:
```
Cannot uninstall requirement tensorflow, not installed
```
Where could this dependency be hiding?"
1455,2017-11-17T11:23:28.000754,Fabiola,"Hi <@Arica>, which OS are you on?"
1455,2017-11-17T11:24:15.000473,Arica,macOS 10.13.1
1455,2017-11-17T11:25:00.000110,Fabiola,"I only know *bash, but let's try this."
1455,2017-11-17T11:25:08.000493,Junita,do you need authentication?
1455,2017-11-17T11:25:16.000326,Fabiola,What happens when you type `which pip` and `which python` into your shell?
1455,2017-11-17T11:25:18.000247,Junita,do you need to paginate the search results?
1455,2017-11-17T11:25:34.000546,Arica,`/usr/local/bin/pip`
1455,2017-11-17T11:25:45.000401,Virgen,paginate... not sure...
1455,2017-11-17T11:25:47.000760,Arica,`/Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin/python`
1455,2017-11-17T11:26:04.000537,Fabiola,"Ok, thought that might be the case ^^"
1455,2017-11-17T11:26:29.000175,Junita,if it’s just a simple query and display I’d actually say Flask would probably be quicker to get you up and running.
1455,2017-11-17T11:27:00.000325,Fabiola,"I'm not an expert, but it looks like you `pip` and `python` are in different distributions, and that's causing the issue"
1455,2017-11-17T11:27:04.000043,Junita,"it’s the bells and whistles like auth, pagination, database models, etc where Django can really help you by guiding you in what to do"
1455,2017-11-17T11:27:11.000583,Fabiola,Because of a conflict in paths
1455,2017-11-17T11:27:13.000226,Arica,well that's farther than I got!
1455,2017-11-17T11:27:21.000490,Arica,Thanks <@Fabiola>!
1455,2017-11-17T11:27:26.000376,Fabiola,I surprised that it picks up one and not the other
1455,2017-11-17T11:27:30.000167,Junita,in the end though I honestly don’t think you can go wrong either way
1455,2017-11-17T11:27:36.000761,Fabiola,Do you have a file called .bashrc in your home directory?
1455,2017-11-17T11:27:43.000021,Arica,yeah
1455,2017-11-17T11:27:52.000283,Fabiola,does it have a line in it added by anaconda?
1455,2017-11-17T11:27:59.000184,Junita,"If you have any local resources, like friends or coworkers who have experience in either one, that’d be a good way to prioritize which to choose"
1455,2017-11-17T11:28:00.000642,Virgen,"for pagination, I think I would really only need the main page and limit the number of results."
1455,2017-11-17T11:28:09.000163,Fabiola,"something like `export PATH=""/home/ogaday/miniconda3/bin:$PATH""`"
1455,2017-11-17T11:28:24.000810,Arica,no it doesn't
1455,2017-11-17T11:28:30.000845,Arica,"hmm, i may have accidentally removed it"
1455,2017-11-17T11:28:39.000316,Arica,if it was supposed to be there
1455,2017-11-17T11:28:56.000701,Fabiola,Interesting ^^ I think it's an option to put it there automatically when installing anaconda
1455,2017-11-17T11:29:33.000247,Virgen,hmm... I'm torn. I think I might go with django. I dont have any local resources for assistance. My understanding is that django has the more significant web community.
1455,2017-11-17T11:31:03.000111,Virgen,"and, if this is successful, I may start looking for other tasks that I can simplify by building a simple webapp, when that time comes, if I need some of those features you talked about in django, I would rather build on existing knowledge than learn django after having figured out flask..."
1455,2017-11-17T11:31:04.000726,Fabiola,"Do you want to do a bit of deeper troubleshooting, or do you just want to get on with other stuff right now?"
1455,2017-11-17T11:31:05.000555,Junita,"it might, although I’m not sure the difference would be significant enough to matter."
1455,2017-11-17T11:31:18.000549,Junita,yeah that sounds like a good plan
1455,2017-11-17T11:31:47.000471,Junita,"django definitely has a little more of a learning curve than flask, but it’ll shine when you get into intermediate level stuff"
1455,2017-11-17T11:37:49.000328,Virgen,thank you for the info! I do appreciate it!
1455,2017-11-17T11:38:30.000337,Fabiola,"Essentially: you want to be installing stuff using `/Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin/pip` instead of `/usr/local/bin/pip`, because the different `pip`s will install the packages to different places. If you try `/Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin/pip uninstall tensorflow` it should work. And in future you want to be using the anaconda pip, not your system pip, because you're using the python interpreter installed by anaconda, which will look for packages installed in the place the anaconda `pip` uses, which if why you could run that file without trouble before"
1455,2017-11-17T11:39:12.000450,Junita,np
1455,2017-11-17T11:41:30.000349,Fabiola,"In the future, rather than always writing `/Users/danilo.../pip` when using `pip` you can modify your `PATH` environment variable so that it points at `anaconda/bin` before `usr/lcoal/bin`"
1455,2017-11-17T11:46:04.000376,Fabiola,"Anther consideration for the future is that when doing projects you can create virtual environments, either using `conda` (<https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html>) or virtual envs (<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>). That way, each project will have it's own packages and dependencies. So you can use `tensorflow 1.0.0` for one project, and `tensorflow 1.2.0` for another. That way, code you wrote a year ago will still run. It takes a little bit more thought to manage, but it's worth it, in my experience"
1455,2017-11-17T11:50:53.000008,Fabiola,"I prefer `conda`, because it's better for things like `scipy`, `numpy`, etc.

Oh, and I think to fix your `PATH` variable you could put a line like `export PATH=""Users/danilo.herrera/anaconda/bin:$PATH""` in your `.bashrc` but I'm not sure. You can try and delete the line later if it doesn't work!"
1455,2017-11-17T11:52:20.000258,Fabiola,"To see what your `PATH` currently looks like, I think you can write `echo $PATH` in your shell"

1467,2017-11-19T14:41:03.000094,Ciera,would it not make more sense to use `dict` instead of `list` ?
1467,2017-11-19T14:42:11.000051,Krysta,"Yeah probably, I try a dictionary then"
1467,2017-11-20T02:34:37.000041,Ciera,I think you need to do the % yourself
1467,2017-11-20T02:34:52.000147,Ciera,but you can tell it to increment by a little bit for each line you read ?
1467,2017-11-20T02:57:23.000171,Krysta,"Thanks <@Ciera>, using  a dict seems much simpler, I just have a question"
1467,2017-11-20T02:58:18.000120,Krysta,"My code is ```listOne = {'itemOne': '£0.20', 'itemTwo': '£0.16'}

listThree = {'itemOne': '£0.00', 'itemTwo': '£0.10'}
listFour = {'itemOne': '£0.21', 'itemTwo': '£0.13'}

# WORKING EXAMPLE
for (a,b), (c,d), (e,f), (g,h) in zip(listOne.items(), listTwo.items(), listThree.items(), listFour.items()):
    if a == c == e == g:
        print(a, max(b, d, f, h))```"
1467,2017-11-20T02:58:54.000054,Krysta,"So in the above it print's out ```itemOne £0.21
itemTwo £0.43```"

1467,2017-11-20T03:02:01.000030,Krysta,"so i can manually see the £.21 came from listFour and then other from listTwo, I'm not sure how i can write this in code"

1467,2017-11-20T03:19:22.000303,Krysta,theres a chance the elements are missing
1467,2017-11-20T03:20:02.000143,Krysta,So itemOne might not be present in listTwo etc

1467,2017-11-20T03:23:03.000140,Krysta,So the above you gave is similar to mine and works :smile: but i need to access the name of the dictionary not the items etc
1467,2017-11-20T03:26:48.000035,Ciera,you could do something like:

1473,2017-11-20T11:41:40.000167,Glady,"hey guys. I have a question for those who have experience with `airflow`:
I have: 1 server with few different python applications and I need to set up jobs in airflow for all of them
questions:
1. what would be the best solution - use `airflow` instance per project(requirements.txt for a project) have 1 separate instance and configuration for jobs from all project in this repo
2. If 1 instance per project - there is a problem, that some of of tasks(from different projects - Task1 from project A, taks 4 from project C) resource consuming so there is an idea to group them and run only after each other - then you can’t do it when you have instance per project
3. if 1 separate instance for all projects - you have dependency with all commands paths for projects(`/var/projectA/run.sh`, `/var/projectB/run-123.sh`) and deploy changes becomes a bit tricky
sorry for these nubes questions, `airflow` smth new for me :slightly_smiling_face:"
1473,2017-11-20T14:19:29.000437,Meg,Try removing it from git tracking 
1473,2017-11-20T14:19:53.000186,Meg,Sounds like you added it to the repository before the gitignore was created 
1473,2017-11-20T14:20:27.000022,Meg,And the path to the file has to start with the location of the gitignore file as the root 
1473,2017-11-20T14:23:46.000086,Kiersten,`git rm db.sqlite3 --cached` will remove it from tracking but keeps the file

1474,2017-11-20T14:32:14.000443,Johnette,In python is there a way to have multiple locks and then your function attempt to acquire one of them?
1474,2017-11-20T14:33:11.000121,Johnette,"I have a resource that only accepts 4 connections. In my multithreaded function, I want to say if one of the 4 locks are available grab it, otherwise wait"
1474,2017-11-20T14:35:47.000325,Suellen,do you use threads or async?
1474,2017-11-20T14:35:53.000464,Johnette,threads
1474,2017-11-20T14:36:11.000118,Suellen,"<https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#semaphore-objects>
Will something like this work for you?"
1474,2017-11-20T14:36:25.000380,Suellen,"&gt; if the internal counter is larger than zero on entry, decrement it by one and return immediately. If it is zero on entry, block, waiting until some other thread has called release() to make it larger than zero."
1474,2017-11-20T14:37:01.000040,Suellen,"i.e. you can initialize a semaphore with value = 4, and you will have no more than 4 threads acquiring it at the same time"
1474,2017-11-20T14:38:25.000525,Johnette,"That might work, lemme give it a shot. thanks"
1474,2017-11-20T15:52:54.000609,Johnette,"Learn something new everyday, that worked, thanks <@Suellen>"

1474,2017-11-20T18:08:34.000165,Suellen,"sometimes you need threads, sometimes you need processes"
1474,2017-11-20T18:09:02.000049,Suellen,"processes are easier to contol, i.e. kill"
1475,2017-11-20T18:06:35.000407,Marilyn,Is multiprocessing favored instead of threading?
1476,2017-11-20T20:39:35.000152,Myong,"Using `SQLAlchemy` I have 3 tables. One of the tables is newly added and should act as a main reference for another table.

1476,2017-11-20T20:46:54.000051,Myong,I suppose I can use ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ...

1478,2017-11-21T13:53:07.000234,Jesusa,I'm wondering how to more easily manage a list of regexes + functions
1478,2017-11-21T13:54:07.000393,Jesusa,I would pretty much want people be able to select which of these they want
1478,2017-11-21T13:55:21.000040,Jesusa,it's now unusable because it is in a list of a class
1478,2017-11-21T13:55:38.000208,Jesusa,"but the other extreme, having to import all these, is also bad"
1478,2017-11-21T13:56:49.000512,Jesusa,"i guess i'll have to make groupings that are logical to ""end users"" so they'll just have a few boolean flags"
1478,2017-11-21T13:57:11.000631,Jesusa,though there should also be a way for them to register their own patterns
1478,2017-11-21T14:07:02.000480,Bernarda,"Anyone know how to use the multiprocessing module with elasticsearch-dsl? I am trying to figure out how to create a ""Fresh connection"" to elasticsearch in a test I am creating that validates concurrency.

^^ See notes section about needing a fresh connection."
1478,2017-11-21T14:13:04.000175,Vita,"<@Jesusa> maybe have a docs/explanation section that explains the difference between each option, and then put a select box below with the names of each to tell the program which one to use"
1478,2017-11-21T14:14:02.000087,Jesusa,<@Vita> the program will be a library though :slightly_smiling_face:
1478,2017-11-21T14:20:43.000124,Vita,Unless this is deciding what regex a service should use...then I am at a loss of what to do
1479,2017-11-21T14:15:53.000382,Vita,"Ahhh, then I would recommend having each one separated so that they have to specify which one they want to import"
1480,2017-11-21T15:08:22.000568,Season,"Hi,  got what I hope is an easy question…   I am wondering how to find the index position of a row in JSON with out a loop.  Say I have this JSON…
```
[
    {""Network"": ""net1"", ""Device"": ""111111""},
    {""Network"": ""net2"", ""Device"": ""222222""},
    {""Network"": ""net3"", ""Device"": ""333333""},

]
```
And I want the value for device for net2… Is there a way to quickly look that up without having to iterate through it?"
1480,2017-11-21T15:10:05.000226,Patty,nope
1480,2017-11-21T15:10:53.000431,Patty,unless `net2` is always the second in the list
1480,2017-11-21T15:14:02.000328,Season,<@Patty> so I have to loop is what you are telling me?
1480,2017-11-21T15:14:13.000161,Patty,Yep
1480,2017-11-21T15:14:35.000694,Patty,unless the `Device` you want to get at `net2` is _always_ second in the list
1480,2017-11-21T15:16:04.000379,Season,no I cant say that for sure
1480,2017-11-21T15:16:22.000375,Patty,"Okay, then yep, you’ll have to loop through it"
1480,2017-11-21T15:19:47.000002,Season,"I am comparing to find when a previous value in the “list of dictionaries” :slightly_smiling_face: changes, so I will be looping 700 rows and then needing to loop up-to 700 times for each comparison.  Is there a better way I can store that data that would allow me to look up the values more efficiently?"
1480,2017-11-21T15:21:54.000162,Antionette,Are the network names unique? If so you can store it as a dictionary keyed to the network name with the value as the device name
1480,2017-11-21T15:23:45.000359,Antionette,And I don't think this changes anything because when you're working with it then its probably a list of dictionaries but as is it looks like valid json besides the trailing comma
1480,2017-11-21T15:27:28.000014,Antionette,"Hmmm I'm pretty sure the top level can be either an object or an array, possibly any valid json value as well"
1480,2017-11-21T15:31:34.000038,Patty,"yeah nevermind i was loking at something different, i shouldnt be doing like 15 things at once"
1480,2017-11-21T15:34:24.000403,Patty,"anyway, my brain being elsewhere aside, to echo <@Antionette> if the network names are unique put it all in a dictionary, lookup is much more performant"
1480,2017-11-21T15:34:44.000482,Patty,(or if the devices are unique)
1481,2017-11-21T15:45:31.000380,Jesusa,here's for a fun challenge
1481,2017-11-21T15:46:08.000525,Jesusa,"make a ""datetime.datetime"" object that when evaluated in any way always returns a current ""now"" value"

1481,2017-11-21T15:46:52.000016,Jesusa,`now.second == datetime.now().second`
1481,2017-11-21T15:55:52.000539,Jesusa,it was trickier than i thought
1481,2017-11-21T15:56:14.000206,Jesusa,I'll post my version here (attempting to hide spoilers)
1482,2017-11-21T16:20:35.000311,Season,"<@Patty> <@Antionette> Thanks, I’ll try that!"
1482,2017-11-21T16:23:26.000551,Season,"A new question.  I just upgraded from 2.6 to 3.6 and some code I was using before doesn’t work ay more and I am not clear on how to fix it.  I am using some sample google api code to send an email and it seems the base64  module doesnt play the same.

1489,2017-11-22T11:49:44.000147,Sheila,But `arg1` is always required since it doesn't have a default value (the `=something`) in the function's signature

1491,2017-11-22T13:12:22.000304,Sharolyn,<@Lilliam> It would depend on what GUI framework(if any) you are using. If you are using PyQT for example it can be done using signals and slots
1491,2017-11-22T13:17:01.000393,Lilliam,not using that <@Sharolyn> using tkinter
1491,2017-11-22T13:24:09.000003,Sharolyn,in tkinter you can use StringVar.trace to update your menu when the associated variable is changed

1493,2017-11-22T16:12:48.000313,Ciera,"a 502 means that nginx can't connect to the stuff it need to proxy to, In this case your flask app"

1495,2017-11-23T07:44:46.000061,Federico,you need to pass arguments into your getter argument
1495,2017-11-23T07:45:17.000028,Federico,are the fields you are calling 'get()' on from your framework?
1495,2017-11-23T07:45:50.000012,Federico,"or from your superclass Frame, which I assume is coming from your framework"
1495,2017-11-23T07:46:02.000237,Lilliam,yes all the other get() fields work it is the self.BD.get() that is giving issues because it is in a dictionary
1495,2017-11-23T07:47:00.000181,Lilliam,"and in this line 

```
    def update(self, *args):

1495,2017-11-23T07:47:02.000409,Federico,in this case you are trying to access a value rom your dict
1495,2017-11-23T07:47:16.000084,Federico,which is why it expects a key-parameter
1495,2017-11-23T07:47:30.000193,Lilliam,yes trying to figure out what arg to pass
1495,2017-11-23T07:47:49.000200,Federico,what are you trying to do wit the dict?
1495,2017-11-23T07:48:25.000042,Lilliam,dynamically update my option menu which i do but when i try to make the text and macro file it doesnt work
1495,2017-11-23T07:48:46.000225,Federico,well then parse the dict into a json string
1495,2017-11-23T07:49:27.000012,Federico,that way you just read the value
1495,2017-11-23T07:50:58.000226,Lilliam,not familiar with json
1495,2017-11-23T07:51:16.000097,Lilliam,there is no way just to do it in python
1495,2017-11-23T07:52:47.000413,Federico,it is still in python
1495,2017-11-23T07:52:53.000109,Federico,json is a way to represent data structures
1495,2017-11-23T07:53:25.000341,Federico,like XML
1495,2017-11-23T07:55:51.000277,Lilliam,oh ok nice to know thanks I will look into those but I would want to do it in python still learning a lot
1495,2017-11-23T08:12:59.000084,Federico,"it seems like you're trying to access an attribute which does not exist, in this case opt_b"
1495,2017-11-23T08:13:05.000002,Federico,I assume it's a dictionary?
1495,2017-11-23T08:20:00.000026,Lilliam,no opt_b is the opt menu that is updated

How do I get desired output?"
1502,2017-11-24T11:49:22.000141,Meg,you need to make an accumulator function that will iterate over the list items and consolidate everything
1502,2017-11-24T11:57:38.000168,Seema,<@Pasquale> are you seeking output like the first format and you are getting the second one?
1502,2017-11-24T11:59:08.000268,Meg,"thats what I gather. problem is, scrapy runs in a loop, so you need to have some accumulator function outside of that loop to maintain overall state"
1502,2017-11-24T12:00:33.000020,Seema,"then I agree, but... scrapy...  :disappointed:"
1502,2017-11-24T12:00:56.000151,Seema,"there's also a <#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping> channel that could use some love, lol"
1503,2017-11-24T12:20:52.000021,Pasquale,the second one.

1503,2017-11-24T12:21:45.000025,Pasquale,the first one

1504,2017-11-24T15:14:37.000149,Lakeesha,"Hi, I hope this is the right place to ask! I'm currently trying to figure out a way to generate values from a system of first-order differential equations (namely the Lotka Volterra equations) without specifying a certain timeframe (e.g. it acts like a generator, yielding new values each time it's called). I have a rudimentary generator using a more advanced Euler's Method, but I know there's a class from SciPy (namely Odeint) that also does something akin to this; would anyone be able to help me understand SciPy's Odeint function? Thanks so much!! I'm ideally going to try and graph these points with Matplotlib dynamically, but I've had some trouble with that too, haha."
1505,2017-11-24T18:15:12.000039,Doreen,Is anyone familiar with the Curses library?
1505,2017-11-24T23:46:21.000014,Seema,I suspect you would like a coroutine.  Unfortunately when you search for coroutine you'll get all sorts of asyncio.  Here's a simply example of coroutine where the coroutine spits out a result iteratively
1505,2017-11-24T23:46:24.000043,Seema,"```def fibonacci_co():
    current = 0
    next = 1

    while True:
        current, next = next, next + current
        yield current

for n in fibonacci_co():
    if n &gt; 1000:
        break

    print(n, end=', ')````"

I am trying to insert ~2 millions rows into a Postgres DB and no matter what method I try with SQL Alchemy It's super slow ( &gt; 5minutes ). Even using raw SQL it's slow, so I think I need to consider chunking more rows into the insert statement - is there a limit? Any other tips or advice on how best to do large inserts at once?"
1506,2017-11-25T01:57:52.000030,France,"<@Wonda> I don't have any solution to improve that. but insert 2 millions rows into database at the same time is bad.
Let's think in cache. My solutions for that is cache everything, after then we will using a bot or service to handle cache."

1507,2017-11-25T03:38:43.000016,Suellen,TLDR: Use `bulk_insert_mappings()` and commit after every thousand inserts or so

1509,2017-11-25T15:27:27.000040,Zelma,hey guys
1509,2017-11-25T15:27:52.000060,Zelma,"So i am new to python, I am on linux and i seem to have python (v2.7) and python3 preinstalled"
1509,2017-11-25T15:28:40.000077,Zelma,when i open my vscode IDE it tries to install a bunch of things like my linter (which will run the commands against the /usr/bin/python binary and not the v3 one)
1509,2017-11-25T15:29:01.000020,Zelma,Am i supposed to change the symlink on my install if i want to use python3?
1509,2017-11-25T15:29:25.000033,Zelma,Or do i have to upgrade the default version? Or what do i do?
1509,2017-11-25T15:31:42.000043,Ciera,before installing anything you should check out virtualenv
1509,2017-11-25T15:32:00.000002,Ciera,you don't want to install stuff on your system python as it's widely used by other tools
1509,2017-11-25T15:35:24.000017,Zelma,I see.. so it isolates it for your project
1509,2017-11-25T15:35:48.000055,Zelma,basically like NPM / Composer so you have your dependencies for your project only?
1509,2017-11-25T15:36:11.000042,Ciera,yeah exactly
1509,2017-11-25T15:36:45.000058,Ciera,depending on your system you might also want to compile the latest python `3.6.3` so you can learn with the newest
1509,2017-11-25T15:37:27.000045,Ciera,there are multiple tools that can help you with that. I would recommend `pyenv` or `pythonz`
1509,2017-11-25T15:39:16.000059,Zelma,"so wait.. i dont even know what all those things are yet.. i want to run a python script and now i hear about virtualenv, pip, pyenv, pythonz"
1509,2017-11-25T15:39:52.000015,Zelma,pythonz is like nvm?
1509,2017-11-25T15:42:37.000076,Ciera,If you just want to run a python script you can easily run it with your system python. Then if you need to install dependencies you should use a virtualenv that split dependencies per project and you use pip to install the modules you need
1509,2017-11-25T15:43:51.000021,Ciera,What you can also do is install other version of python if you want to develop on them. Theses version should be installed alongside your system python because replacing it could cause some bugs for your system
1509,2017-11-25T15:44:43.000043,Zelma,I see.. but what do i point to in my python scripts? #!/usr/bin/env python ?
1509,2017-11-25T15:45:10.000068,Ciera,If you are on a recent linux your python3 version should be at least `3.5.x`. There is now python `3.6.x` but it doesn't changes a lot of things especially if you are a beginner
1509,2017-11-25T15:45:38.000084,Ciera,I believe `#!/usr/bin/env python` is correct but I usually don't put a shebang so I'm not sure
1509,2017-11-25T15:48:11.000045,Zelma,Well if i want to use v3 for it (any 3.* version should be compatible with any v3 version if python follows semver) So would i target python3?
1509,2017-11-25T15:50:09.000008,Ciera,if your script only run on python3 yes
1509,2017-11-25T15:50:27.000020,Ciera,usually python without version point to python2
1509,2017-11-25T15:51:57.000029,Zelma,I see..
1509,2017-11-25T15:52:34.000063,Zelma,So what is pyvenv? the pythonz docs point to it if python &gt;= 3.3
1509,2017-11-25T15:52:50.000043,Zelma,I want to use the latest version of python.. so definitely &gt;= 3.3
1509,2017-11-25T15:53:56.000081,Ciera,If you build on python3 I personally recommend aiming compatibility for python3.5 and up
1509,2017-11-25T15:54:06.000084,Ciera,but then it can depends on what you are doing
1509,2017-11-25T15:54:54.000058,Zelma,Why does it matter if i use 3.4 or 3.5 or 3.6? Shouldn't they all work with python3
1509,2017-11-25T15:55:41.000051,Ciera,they are all forward compatible but 3.5 and 3.6 brings new features that aren't supported on older version
1509,2017-11-25T15:57:28.000030,Zelma,that sounds like it is not  forward compatible at all if they aren't supported
1509,2017-11-25T15:58:24.000045,Zelma,That they have new features should be obvious (hence the version bump)
1509,2017-11-25T16:00:29.000041,Ciera,well a new feature in 3.5 is not supported in 3.4
1509,2017-11-25T16:05:25.000065,Zelma,Yeah of course
1509,2017-11-25T16:05:42.000086,Zelma,so having in mind that i want to use python &gt;= 3.3
1509,2017-11-25T16:06:18.000070,Zelma,And i already have installed pythonz and my pthon 3.6.2 is ready to go
1509,2017-11-25T16:07:01.000012,Zelma,whats the next step for me here? Do i install virtualenv or venv (Which seems to be the new thing since python 3.3?)
1509,2017-11-25T16:07:58.000068,Ciera,you can create a virtualenv with `/path/to/python -m venv path/to/env`
1509,2017-11-25T16:08:19.000002,Ciera,and then activate it with `. path/to/env/bin/activate`
1509,2017-11-25T16:09:17.000037,Zelma,"""/path/to/env"" is my directory? like a npm project directory?"
1509,2017-11-25T16:09:38.000023,Zelma,and the path/to/python is just any python version? Or do i have to use the pythonz binary path)
1509,2017-11-25T16:10:30.000033,Ciera,paht to env is the path to the env direcory. So usually your/project/.env
1509,2017-11-25T16:10:48.000002,Ciera,and you need to use the python executable of the version you want your env to be in
1509,2017-11-25T16:12:03.000052,Zelma,so in my case pythonz locate 3.6.2
1509,2017-11-25T16:12:23.000039,Ciera,yep
1509,2017-11-25T16:15:22.000072,Zelma,So i did this and it created a pyenv.cfg file and a bunch of folders
1509,2017-11-25T16:18:34.000049,Zelma,So following the docs from <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments>
1509,2017-11-25T16:18:49.000104,Zelma,i activated the environment with source ./bin/activate
1509,2017-11-25T16:19:13.000013,Zelma,and now executing the script which was targeting python now outputs v3.6.2
1509,2017-11-25T16:19:17.000071,Zelma,so that seems like a good start
1509,2017-11-25T16:19:41.000005,Ciera,now you can `pip install stuff` safely without risking to mess your system python :thumbsup:
1509,2017-11-25T16:20:13.000033,Zelma,And if i change projects i pretty much do the same there but then activate the other project and install stuff there via pip
1509,2017-11-25T16:21:09.000105,Ciera,yes
1509,2017-11-25T16:21:37.000055,Zelma,So why did you point me to virtualenv in the beginning? Did you assume i was using a python version below 3.3? or is there some additional benefit of using it?
1509,2017-11-25T16:22:44.000045,Ciera,"I'm just used to say virtualenv. They are all the same things, it's just the way to create them that changed"
1509,2017-11-25T16:25:43.000060,Zelma,ahh i see..
1509,2017-11-25T16:28:39.000039,Zelma,i am getting a bunch of errors trying to pip install things
1509,2017-11-25T16:28:54.000043,Zelma,first of all i installed setuptools using sudo pip install setuptools
1509,2017-11-25T16:29:02.000049,Zelma,"and it gives me ""Requirement already satisfied: setuptools in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages"""
1509,2017-11-25T16:29:19.000051,Ciera,you shouldn't need to `sudo`
1509,2017-11-25T16:29:20.000061,Zelma,which does not really sound like it is inside the virtual env?
1509,2017-11-25T16:29:32.000081,Zelma,that gave me a permission error earlier without sudo
1509,2017-11-25T16:29:37.000064,Ciera,and are you sure your env is activated ?
1509,2017-11-25T16:29:56.000083,Zelma,"it says ""(python_test) name@name-pc ~python_test $"
1509,2017-11-25T16:30:14.000032,Zelma,so it sounds like it is correct
1509,2017-11-25T16:30:33.000036,Zelma,"but the fact that it points to 2.7 doesn't sound right, does it"
1509,2017-11-25T16:30:37.000028,Ciera,can you do `which pip` ?
1509,2017-11-25T16:30:46.000023,Ciera,and `python --version`
1509,2017-11-25T16:31:03.000007,Zelma,but return the correct thing
1509,2017-11-25T16:31:16.000008,Zelma,python_test/bin/pip and v3.6.2
1509,2017-11-25T16:31:40.000084,Lakeesha,"anyone here good with matplotlib, specifically the FuncAnimation aspect?"
1509,2017-11-25T16:32:06.000020,Ciera,can you do `pip install requests` and copy the error here if you got one :slightly_smiling_face:
1509,2017-11-25T16:32:13.000005,Zelma,"when i run  pip install pyside Command ""python setup.py egg_info"" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-z7ojhvbi/pyside/"

1509,2017-11-25T16:33:48.000063,Ciera,that might be a problem with pyside then

1509,2017-11-25T16:34:43.000051,Ciera,can you do `pip install -U pip setuptools`

1511,2017-11-25T21:15:35.000052,Meg,questions
1511,2017-11-25T21:15:47.000012,Zelma,which one?
1511,2017-11-25T21:15:52.000008,Meg,learning how to phrase a question will get you far in getting answers
1511,2017-11-25T21:16:10.000003,Meg,"you’re being very fragmented, and its hard for anyone to understand the issue you’re having"
1511,2017-11-25T21:16:28.000038,Corrinne,`pip list` is a handy little command
1511,2017-11-25T21:17:00.000050,Zelma,i was going to get to my question regarding why it doesnt work in a bit
1511,2017-11-25T21:17:05.000037,Zelma,once i rule out some other factors
1511,2017-11-25T21:24:21.000021,Zelma,i dont even know where to start.. its a huge output when i am trying to install pyside
1511,2017-11-25T21:25:58.000046,Zelma,Seems like the package itself has some missing files? Does someone here use pyside?
1511,2017-11-25T21:31:21.000015,Collette,<@Zelma> you should paste the whole output
1511,2017-11-25T23:09:05.000010,Zelma,Well does anyone else have that problem?
1511,2017-11-25T23:09:33.000089,Zelma,If none else has that problem then something else must be wrong
1511,2017-11-25T23:14:11.000063,Collette,You need to paste the whole output if you want to receive any help.
1512,2017-11-25T21:29:51.000028,Meg,"Never heard of it, sorry 
But seems like that's an issue with the pyside package. Is there anything in the project repository issue tracker about installation problems?"

1517,2017-11-26T17:27:07.000053,Staci,Question
1517,2017-11-26T17:30:06.000100,Staci,"I'm helping someone out with a homework problem, and their teacher/textbook has them naming class attributes with double underscores. What is the purpose of this?

for example we have a class Nation:
```
class Nation:
    def __init__(self, name, continent, population):
        self.__name = name
        self.__continent = continent
        self.__population = population
```"
1517,2017-11-26T17:31:09.000033,Staci,"What does the double underscore do here? I know it does something because when I create an instance, I can't access the attributes with .__name"
1517,2017-11-26T17:31:22.000106,Staci,I have to access with ._Nation__name
1517,2017-11-26T17:31:28.000091,Staci,What is the purpose of this?
1517,2017-11-26T17:33:26.000029,Corrinne,"__double_leading_underscore: when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar, __boo becomes _FooBar__boo; see below).

__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__: ""magic"" objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces. E.g. __init__,  __import__ or __file__. Never invent such names; only use them as documented."
1517,2017-11-26T17:34:28.000003,Corrinne,Not sure if this helps
1517,2017-11-26T17:34:30.000006,Corrinne,"Naming an attribute in your class self._var1 indicates to the user of the class that the attribute should only be accessed by the class's internals (or perhaps those of a subclass) and that they need not directly access it and probably shouldn't modify it. You should use leading underscores in the same places that you would use a private or protected field in Java or C#, but be aware that the language doesn't actually enforce non-access - instead you trust your class's user to not do anything stupid, and leave them the option of accessing (or modifying) your class's private field if they're really, really sure that they know what they're doing and it makes sense."
1517,2017-11-26T17:35:16.000059,Corrinne,I wondered the same thing a while ago. Quite a good answer here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1301346/what-is-the-meaning-of-a-single-and-a-double-underscore-before-an-object-name>
1517,2017-11-26T17:36:05.000097,Staci,"Based on the assignment, and the textbook, it looks to me like the class is heavily influenced by Java/C# principles that aren't really relevant in python"
1517,2017-11-26T17:36:36.000024,Staci,"What is the purpose of ""Name Mangling""?"
1517,2017-11-26T17:39:23.000008,Staci,"Ah, nevermind. I think I see it here in pep8"
1517,2017-11-26T17:39:24.000058,Staci,"To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to invoke Python's name mangling rules.

Python mangles these names with the class name: if class Foo has an attribute named __a, it cannot be accessed by Foo.__a. (An insistent user could still gain access by calling Foo._Foo__a.) Generally, double leading underscores should be used only to avoid name conflicts with attributes in classes designed to be subclassed."
1517,2017-11-26T17:39:37.000106,Staci,avoiding name clashes with subclasses
1517,2017-11-26T17:39:47.000047,Corrinne,Still learning myself. I think it's a way of protecting certain class attributes
1517,2017-11-26T17:40:13.000031,Staci,"Yea, I've heard of using a single _ to note that it should only be used internally"

1522,2017-11-27T04:03:33.000005,Ciera,where do you loop on the rows ?
1522,2017-11-27T04:05:17.000332,Ciera,basically you can't append to a file
1522,2017-11-27T04:05:37.000218,Ciera,so each time you open you delete everything inside.
1522,2017-11-27T04:06:02.000134,Ciera,what you could do is open it before looping on the rows and write each row in it
1522,2017-11-27T04:07:05.000155,Ciera,"```
with open(...) as f:
  writer = csv.writer(f)
  for row in rows:
    writer.writerow(...)
```"
1522,2017-11-27T04:07:48.000446,Ciera,See <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files>

1524,2017-11-27T04:47:27.000053,Jazmine,"In a rule how to I deny and allow further crawling? For example parse `<http://udemy.com|udemy.com>` links, but not follow links further in it"
1524,2017-11-27T04:47:48.000145,Jazmine,`follow=True` doesn't seem to work that way

1525,2017-11-27T08:02:57.000004,Zelma,Can someone explain to me the pip3 vs pip thing?
1525,2017-11-27T08:03:06.000397,Zelma,pip seems to be at version 9.0.1 for me
1525,2017-11-27T08:03:14.000377,Zelma,and i use the venv which uses python 3.6.2
1525,2017-11-27T08:04:26.000101,Ciera,if you are in a python3 virtualenv `pip` and `pip3` should be the same
1526,2017-11-27T08:31:22.000111,Robbin,Is there a way of running a management command that can dodge errors like 'debug_log_name is not defined'
1526,2017-11-27T08:32:48.000252,Meg,write your own exception handlers :smile:
1526,2017-11-27T09:03:20.000434,Robbin,"So i'm getting an error when i run my management command. It's upset about missing log files, but they are their. 

I think my staging server is using my Dev settings as it is complaining it cannot find '/logs/django_debug.log"" But that is only set in dev/settings. it should be looking for ''/logs/twm_django_debug.log' 

I'm not to sure what to do here, any suggestions?"
1526,2017-11-27T09:05:16.000058,Meg,what you probably want to do is use the `--settings` flag and specify the module path to the settings
1526,2017-11-27T09:05:55.000258,Meg,eg `./manage.py runserver --settings=project.settings.development 0.0.0.0:8080`
1526,2017-11-27T09:06:38.000379,Robbin,ah okay!

1526,2017-11-27T09:07:31.000199,Meg,that applys to `manage.py` as well

1528,2017-11-27T13:23:50.000242,Season,ah….  gotcha
1528,2017-11-27T13:23:58.000196,Meg,"though, I would suggest you migrate to using requests"
1528,2017-11-27T13:24:17.000525,Meg,its pretty much the defacto lib for making http calls with python

1528,2017-11-27T13:26:53.000244,Ciera,based on the http name
1528,2017-11-27T13:26:55.000754,Meg,"ok, then with that, you’d want to catch a RequestException"
1528,2017-11-27T13:27:14.000074,Ciera,but the new example seems to be requests

1529,2017-11-27T13:21:36.000290,Season,"Hi, quick question.  I have a python3 script that iterates through the Meraki API but the connection or API isnt very stable and I get these errors…

  File ""/usr/lib/python3.5/http/client.py"", line 266, in _read_status
    raise RemoteDisconnected(""Remote end closed connection without""

Which part of this is the exception for me to use in a try catch? would it be “RemoteDisconnected”?"
1530,2017-11-27T15:31:46.000073,Season,"My manager just walked up and asked if I can write scripts for windows machines. I told him I havent in many years but I can learn anything…  My first though was powershell, and my second was, wait, why not python…. I think its just a matter of moving files around on the network but I don’t have project details yet..  So any thoughts on were one tool is better than the other?"
1530,2017-11-27T15:32:23.000472,Ciera,it depends who is going to run the script
1530,2017-11-27T15:33:03.000576,Ciera,python you need to install it so it might be a bit more complex if random users needs to use it
1530,2017-11-27T15:33:07.000094,Mallie,"Python is not installed by default on Windows, that's one thing"
1530,2017-11-27T15:35:21.000561,Season,I wouldn’t imagine I’d get push back on installing python but I have no issues with learning powershell either.
1530,2017-11-27T15:36:14.000342,Seema,"I'd recommend PowerShell if you're on a Windows DC, else whatever floats your boat"
1530,2017-11-27T15:37:14.000213,Ciera,and if you have the time to learn PowerShell might as well do it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1530,2017-11-27T15:38:13.000402,Seema,DC = Domain Controller
1530,2017-11-27T15:39:38.000506,Season,yeah active directory is in place here
1530,2017-11-27T15:42:04.000164,Seema,"I'm going to assert (from past experience) that it's much easier to ask the domain admin to create an account in order to authenticate with AD.  Python can connect to the LDAP directory, query, and authenticate though you're asking python to ""be"" a windows user and depending on how the AD is setup, you/domain admin might get (weird) errors about the ticket system or use of resources or other arcane stuff"
1530,2017-11-27T15:43:02.000028,Seema,and to troubleshoot you'll have to dig through event viewer logs on the server to figure out why you can X but not Y
1530,2017-11-27T15:44:18.000140,Seema,PowerShell has 20+ years (from mmc console) of getting passed the TGT (more fun Windows trivia).   You'll learn a lot trying it with Python though you may or may not want to have a new respect for Windows.  YMMV  :wink:

1530,2017-11-27T15:47:01.000210,Seema,I fully admit I haven't waded into this in 3ish years and might be harder or easier at this point.
1530,2017-11-27T15:47:43.000568,Season,lol  Powershell it is…
1530,2017-11-27T15:48:27.000532,Seema,It's quite mature at this point
1530,2017-11-27T15:51:19.000007,Johana,you can use python and subprocess to execute powershell scripts
1530,2017-11-27T15:51:59.000293,Seema,<@Johana> way to square the circle!
1530,2017-11-27T15:53:23.000386,Johana,that’s what we did to setup employee on-boarding.

1537,2017-11-28T08:27:50.000006,Meg,me either… only reason I can think of is lowercase options were set at a different time than the uppercase

1541,2017-11-28T13:24:10.000663,Micheline,It's more efficient to have `a.method_one()` run on import for my case since it could be a operation that takes a short while. Is there an alternative I can do in my tests?

1559,2017-11-29T19:01:58.000528,Glinda,"the other thing I'd recommend is that if you are having trouble keeping track of your segments within a template it's a good idea to break up the template into multiple parts. You can trick jinja2 into multiple inheritance through `extends`, `include` and `import` which allows you to do things like template segments for header, footer, if say it's a separation aggreement you'll have a section that waives liability of the lawyer on almost every divorce document so you can create a standard template for this. Having a template with hundreds of pages or even 10s could be reduced to 10 templates, each with about 20 sets of brackets that you can easily check for."

1563,2017-11-30T09:53:38.000570,Suellen,"&gt; One useful application of the second form of iter() is to read lines of a file until a certain line is reached. The following example reads a file until the readline() method returns an empty string:

&gt;        process_line(line)"

I think a lot of those timezone fields are not super standardized so it depends what libs are underneath, and I only really have experience on the Linux side of those libs. No idea what it does in Windows/other. Might be the same, might not. If you're especially concerned about it, you might use datetime to fetch the GMT offset and then convert to time zone codes yourself. If it's not especially critical you can just leave it to the library"

1577,2017-12-01T03:22:32.000286,Ciera,well $TIME2 can be a param you pass to the script and it shutdown by itself at that time
1577,2017-12-01T03:23:37.000248,Suellen,can be messy :confused:
1577,2017-12-01T03:23:46.000429,Suellen,what if it's doing something
1577,2017-12-01T03:23:58.000097,Suellen,I don't really like self-exiting stuff :slightly_smiling_face:
1577,2017-12-01T03:24:30.000022,Ciera,well I don't know the script but I would imagine a `while time.time() &lt; $TIME2`
1577,2017-12-01T03:25:03.000037,Ciera,so you don't just nuke everything at the end :smile:
1577,2017-12-01T03:34:15.000119,Marg,running everything in linux ( openbox)
1577,2017-12-01T03:35:24.000453,Suellen,Is the program interactive or is it just displaying things?
1577,2017-12-01T03:38:14.000323,Marg,just displaying
1577,2017-12-01T03:48:07.000244,Suellen,"Then <@Ciera>’s advice is the way to go. You can provide a command-line argument to this script, which would be, for example, a number of seconds to run.
And then you launch it using cron at 9:00 for 7 hours:
`/path/to/script1.py 25200`"
1577,2017-12-01T03:48:34.000622,Suellen,"I'm not exactly sure about cron and graphical applications, let me check"
1577,2017-12-01T03:49:18.000509,Ciera,if it's a modern linux I would use systemd timers instead of cron :slightly_smiling_face:
1577,2017-12-01T03:49:29.000313,Suellen,"oh, right"
1577,2017-12-01T03:49:37.000534,Suellen,haven't had the chance to use this yet
1577,2017-12-01T03:49:45.000416,Suellen,cron is just so comfy :slightly_smiling_face:
1577,2017-12-01T03:50:09.000542,Ciera,yeah cron is easy
1577,2017-12-01T03:50:28.000031,Ciera,but for more complex things systemd timers are nice.
1577,2017-12-01T03:51:22.000487,Suellen,"oh, you can even stop the service after a number of seconds"
1577,2017-12-01T03:51:32.000232,Suellen,no need to code anything in the app itself
1577,2017-12-01T03:51:53.000212,Ciera,yeah but then you nuke everything I suppose and don't cleanup
1577,2017-12-01T03:52:09.000941,Ciera,or you would need to listen for `SIGHUP` / `SIGKILL`
1577,2017-12-01T03:52:11.000271,Suellen,"afaik, systemd doesn't really `kill -9` right away"
1577,2017-12-01T03:52:55.000480,Ciera,yeah and they also implemented a watchdog to restart your service if not responding
1577,2017-12-01T06:02:09.000437,Sara,guys is there any existing library in python to get disk speed / IO  and network IO  apart from psutil
1578,2017-12-01T06:02:58.000128,Suellen,why isn't psutil suitable?
1579,2017-12-01T08:35:40.000840,Ivonne,Hi guys! Can som1 help me with making a script. I am new in Python. I have one script that downloads files every 15s and put them in the zip and now I need to make another script that follows the changes of those files and if the zip folders are'nt increasing in size the notification should be sent on particular email.
1579,2017-12-01T08:48:23.000337,Ciera,Hey <@Ivonne>. I don't think anyone here will do the work for you. Maybe try to do something by yourself and if you get stuck ask for help on a specific issue.  If you are new to python we often recommend <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>
1580,2017-12-01T09:03:35.000585,Robbin,"Hey guys, so im trying to get all the duplicate part_no's that i have stores in a table, and have that in a report that can be downloaded at anytime.

```
def duplicate_components(request):
    response = HttpResponse(content_type='text.csv')
    response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=""duplicate_components.csv""'
    dups = Component.objects.values('part_no').annotate(name_count=Count('id')).order_by().filter(name_count__gt=1)

    writer = csv.writer(response)
    #for components in Component.objects.filter(part_no__in=[item['part_no'] for item in dups]):
    writer.writerow(dups)
    return response
```
Now its working but the output format is not the best, i think its lists in a dict. 
```
{'part_no': u'', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u' ', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'?', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'000000000', 'name_count': 11}	{'part_no': u'0340460000', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'0383560000', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'06127501301', 'name_count': 2}	{'part_no': u'06b Renold 38 Chain', 'name_count': 3}
```

Outputs to the file like that, as a csv file so im getting `{'part_no': u'', 'name_count': 2}` in each field. 
How would i change the out put to a normal format eg: 
```
Part_no, Count,
345345345, 4
453453434, 5```"
1580,2017-12-01T09:06:01.000902,Meg,what I’d do is look at <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/>
1580,2017-12-01T09:06:13.000053,Meg,use that to generate an excel spreadsheet
1580,2017-12-01T09:06:43.000567,Meg,but your original question… your output is doing exactly what you’re telling it to do
1580,2017-12-01T09:07:14.000007,Meg,because `dups` is a queryset
1580,2017-12-01T09:07:34.000360,Meg,how do you iterate over a queryset to extract the values you need to some intermediate object?
1580,2017-12-01T09:07:45.000664,Robbin,"Yeah i know, im struggling with how i can convert it so i can use keys to print them to a csv file"
1580,2017-12-01T09:08:03.000208,Meg,"well, you’re telling it to use values"
1580,2017-12-01T09:08:46.000638,Robbin,"I have tried to use values_list, i don't know any other alternatives."
1580,2017-12-01T09:10:50.000557,Meg,assuming you have a loop like `for dup in dups`
1580,2017-12-01T09:11:13.000221,Meg,"you’d access the property with a dot variable like `dup.part_no`, `dup.name_count`"
1580,2017-12-01T09:11:31.000831,Meg,"oh, wait"
1580,2017-12-01T09:11:31.001031,Robbin,I have tried: So i have other reports that i have created
1580,2017-12-01T09:11:37.000629,Meg,its a dict set
1580,2017-12-01T09:11:47.000155,Meg,so it’d be `dup.get('part_no')`
1580,2017-12-01T09:12:06.000020,Robbin,ahhhhh
1580,2017-12-01T09:12:18.000203,Meg,"yeah, because with that one, you’re using the queryset with the actual model objects"
1580,2017-12-01T09:12:37.000884,Meg,"with `values`, its just pulling out the field and value alone, and you have to use dict notation"
1580,2017-12-01T09:13:22.000364,Robbin,"writer.writerow([dups.get('part_no'), dups.get('name_count')])"
1580,2017-12-01T09:13:51.000129,Meg,no
1580,2017-12-01T09:13:57.000523,Meg,because `dups` is a list of dicts
1580,2017-12-01T09:14:16.000049,Robbin,thats why i need the for loop?
1580,2017-12-01T09:14:29.000218,Meg,yes
1580,2017-12-01T09:14:49.000496,Meg,unless there’s some way `writerow` will take in a dict
1580,2017-12-01T09:15:11.000361,Meg,"hmm, you can use dictwriter instead"

1580,2017-12-01T09:39:39.000375,Winnie,<@Suellen> it was a problem of iterating an iterator twice
1580,2017-12-01T09:40:15.000774,Winnie,that's the second time I've had that bug
1580,2017-12-01T09:40:35.000412,Winnie,any tips on how to stop shooting myself in the foot like that?
1580,2017-12-01T09:43:05.000109,Suellen,don't iterate over already exhausted generators ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1580,2017-12-01T09:43:15.000459,Winnie,but I don't know that they're generators...
1580,2017-12-01T09:43:38.000332,Winnie,my functions took in an items field
1580,2017-12-01T09:43:52.001032,Winnie,but I had items as Counter.elements()

1582,2017-12-01T10:00:09.001138,Lilliam,thanks any free ebooks out there or anything?
1582,2017-12-01T10:01:16.000682,Lilliam,I plan on purchasing this though this seems good but do you know of any free material
1583,2017-12-01T10:08:55.000077,Glinda,By counter you mean `collections.Counter` ?
1583,2017-12-01T10:16:20.000455,Glinda,"Couple of problems I might not be understanding correctly. 
1. You aren't sure if you are getting an iterator or a iterable. In the first case you exhaust your iterable when you compare. The second case you can do a good check later. 

2. You are always getting an iterator and will always run into the exhausted iterator when you want to use the values. 

In the first case you can deal with this by using `isinstance(obj, type)` and the `collections` library. 
```from collections.abc import Iterable, Iterator

def my_iterator(): 
    yield 1

i = my_iterator()
a = []

isinstance(i, Iterator) # True
isinstance(a, Iterator) # False```"
1583,2017-12-01T10:18:29.000517,Glinda,"So in the case that you actually have an iterable you don't need to worry about exhausting your iterable. This leads us to how do you deal with exhausting an iterable? Well one way is to create an iterable like a list, but this gets rid of the advantages of an iterable- the returned contents could be really large."
1583,2017-12-01T10:19:19.000436,Glinda,"Here's a function that goes over another method that keeps it in an iterable, and lets you deal with not having large memory concerns. 
<http://www.effectivepython.com/2015/01/03/be-defensive-when-iterating-over-arguments/>"
1583,2017-12-01T10:29:37.000551,Glinda,return True if y else False
1583,2017-12-01T10:30:52.000693,Glinda,"```def test_funct(y_val):
    return True if y_val else False

    print(test_funct(None))
    print(test_funct(1))```"
1583,2017-12-01T10:31:58.000764,Lory,"That's making it longer, I know you can do a one line statement for when you have a boolean operation, I just can't remember the syntax for it"
1583,2017-12-01T10:33:01.000070,Glinda,So you want `single line if else value assignment?`
1583,2017-12-01T10:33:09.000151,Glinda,not single line None checking?
1583,2017-12-01T10:33:22.001059,Glinda,Because if you want to check if a value is none
1583,2017-12-01T10:34:42.000602,Lory,"I don't necessarily care if it is None, I just have a value that will be either True or None and I want to save it as a False or True. Which I know of the classic `y = True if x else False` but I know I've used something along the lines of `y = if x` in the past for boolean operations like that"
1583,2017-12-01T10:34:49.000913,Glinda,`small = x if x &lt; y else y`

    test_funct(1)
    ```"
1583,2017-12-01T10:36:54.000449,Glinda,I think what you're getting at is
1583,2017-12-01T10:37:43.000554,Glinda,"I have two conditions I want to check, `y== True`, `y==False`. Now there's other conditions you could have to consider `y == anything else`"
1583,2017-12-01T10:40:56.000953,Glinda,"Since you know  the value ""will be either True or None and you want to map `None -&gt; True` or map `True -&gt; False` Then you only have two actual conditions."
1583,2017-12-01T10:41:37.000398,Glinda,in that case you can do this assignment: `x = True if not y else False`
1583,2017-12-01T10:43:59.000302,Lory,Yea I mean I understand all that and that's not where my confusion is. I just thought I remember there being some super shorthand way to achieve the same goal but I think I'm mistaking it with something like `x = not y` which is possible
1583,2017-12-01T10:48:23.000983,Glinda,"Looks like you can chain ternary operators, but the only case I've seen requires 3 conditions: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/2919360/8143102>"
1583,2017-12-01T10:48:41.000636,Glinda,`1 if a &gt; b else -1 if a &lt; b else 0`

1583,2017-12-01T11:52:10.001303,Glinda,"It looked like he wanted to map `True or None and I want to save it as a False or True` True =&gt; False, None =&gt; True"

1583,2017-12-01T12:39:03.000596,Suellen,or that :stuck_out_tongue:
1583,2017-12-01T12:39:58.000074,Ciera,reversed is a builtin so it should be faster than consume the `enumerate` iterator
1583,2017-12-01T12:40:00.000289,Ciera,but not sure

1583,2017-12-01T12:42:54.000861,Ciera,yeah it's something I discovered not to long ago. You can define a `__reverse__` dunder
1583,2017-12-01T12:43:14.000718,Ciera,if not it will consume everything and then reverse it

1583,2017-12-01T12:43:41.001133,Suellen,Not sure why I wrote it in such a way
1583,2017-12-01T12:44:10.000538,Suellen,It's more logical to reverse and then enumerate

1583,2017-12-01T12:51:41.000140,Glinda,But now the index doesn't correspond to the original index.
1584,2017-12-01T11:46:09.000352,Loris,"`y = bool(x)`, however in almost all cases just using `x` is what you want.  You usually don't want a `bool`, you want something that is ""truthy"" or ""falsey"", and x already is that."

1587,2017-12-01T14:07:58.000157,Sirena,<@Moses> sounds like you need to call pip with sudo because you don't have permissions to write to that folder.
1587,2017-12-01T14:08:41.000900,Sirena,possibly it's a sign that you didn't set permissions correctly when you installed python
1587,2017-12-01T14:09:53.000305,Suellen,`pip install --user ...`

1587,2017-12-01T14:46:33.000991,Suellen,"they should be `il, li, 1i, 1l, l1` and so on... :slightly_smiling_face:"
1587,2017-12-01T14:46:35.001059,Sirena,... or `O0` in case anyone was considering it
1587,2017-12-01T14:46:53.001207,Ethyl,"yes, in the real code you want meaningful names"
1587,2017-12-01T14:51:20.000467,Glinda,"Good point on the speed alex, didn't think about that consideration."
1587,2017-12-01T14:51:37.000392,Glinda,Really though 2 list comprehensions is more readable.
1587,2017-12-01T14:53:34.000851,Sirena,"so I have a performance question, if anyone cares to weigh in"
1587,2017-12-01T14:53:47.000052,Sirena,I have a problem like this:

1587,2017-12-01T14:56:15.001164,Sirena,but it seems quite slow to do this by text matching

1587,2017-12-01T15:00:38.000676,Sirena,looks like.... maybe 8000 rows?
1587,2017-12-01T15:00:52.000454,Suellen,I honestly have no experience with OS X
1587,2017-12-01T15:01:00.000821,Sirena,definitely fits in memory with ease
1587,2017-12-01T15:02:54.000762,Sirena,trying to translate a big heap of ID/value pairs into essentially enum strings
1587,2017-12-01T15:03:00.000922,Suellen,"I mean, I would just load into in-memory sqlite database and query that. Blazing fast even at 100k rows probably"
1587,2017-12-01T15:05:04.001071,Sirena,you happen to have a link handy for sqlite for dummies? I'm not especially experienced with it
1587,2017-12-01T15:05:26.000237,Suellen,Sure: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html>
1587,2017-12-01T15:06:07.000117,Suellen,"or you could just make a dict where a key is an ID, so that you can narrow down from 8000 to a way smaller number of entries in O(1) time"
1587,2017-12-01T15:06:22.000999,Sirena,"yah, that was sorta where I was starting"
1587,2017-12-01T15:06:25.000887,Suellen,"and then iterate over (lower, upper) and check if it's in range"
1587,2017-12-01T15:06:30.000526,Suellen,and if it is - you got it
1587,2017-12-01T15:06:56.001093,Sirena,I don't think I have many (maybe 0?) sub-tables bigger than like 16 entries
1587,2017-12-01T15:07:10.000582,Suellen,"oh, then it's going to be fast"
1587,2017-12-01T15:08:48.000047,Sirena,"alright, thanks for the tips"

1588,2017-12-01T16:45:45.000906,Ethyl,"Do you let cron to run your jobs? If the answer is yes, you can use synchronization mechanism provided by your OS (take a look here: <http://blog.vmfarms.com/2011/03/cross-process-locking-and.html>). If you have 2 python threads, use Lock or Semaphore."
1588,2017-12-01T16:47:38.000393,Ethyl,But if I ha to run 2 jobs sequentially I would put everything in one thread.

1591,2017-12-01T22:26:15.000160,Staci,Any idea why someone would get 'access is denied' they they try to run `pip --version`

1591,2017-12-01T22:41:34.000221,Winnie,maybe there's something wrong with the permissions of the actual pip script?
1591,2017-12-01T22:42:15.000414,Staci,"It should be the standard pip that's included with Python 3.6.3, would it make sense to try and reinstall python?"

1591,2017-12-01T22:53:57.000031,Winnie,I watched a talk once that talked about how one of the permissions in windows that checks if a file is already opened stopped someone from installing things

I did achieve the task.. but how is it normally done, for example I have some url patterns I already created for the app..

```urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),
    url(r'^(?P&lt;pk&gt;[0-9]+)/$', views.DetailView.as_view(), name='detail'),
    url(r'^(?P&lt;pk&gt;[0-9]+)/results/$', views.ResultsView.as_view(), name='results'),
    url(r'^(?P&lt;question_id&gt;[0-9]+)/vote/$', views.vote, name='vote'),
    url(r'^(?P&lt;question_id&gt;[0-9]+)/addchoice/$', views.addchoice, name='addchoice'),

    url(r'^api/v1/question/$',views.question_list,name = 'question.api'),
    url(r'^api/v1/question/(?P&lt;pk&gt;[0-9]+)/detail/$',views.question_detail,name = 'question_detail.api')
]```


and then I added the last two apis for json response of something similar to what the first two urls would output in html, since I have seen api usually having such names for versions and stuff.. I know i am doing something wrong. So how are they actually separated or are they not? apis and html urls."

1610,2017-12-04T20:31:07.000075,Meg,doubt it
1610,2017-12-04T20:31:25.000175,Meg,you will probably have to update openssl or your python version
1610,2017-12-04T20:31:41.000077,Meg,since 2.7.5 is _really_ old
1610,2017-12-04T20:32:00.000080,Meg,are you on linux or mac?
1610,2017-12-04T20:33:49.000315,Erwin,I'm on linux
1610,2017-12-04T20:35:44.000241,Meg,what’s the output of `openssl version`
1610,2017-12-04T20:36:19.000304,Erwin,OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013
1610,2017-12-04T20:36:45.000027,Meg,alright
1610,2017-12-04T20:36:49.000307,Meg,what are you doing to get that error?
1610,2017-12-04T20:36:51.000034,Meg,code?
1610,2017-12-04T20:38:37.000089,Erwin,that is the acctual code and I'm trying to change splunk default password using ansible
1610,2017-12-04T20:38:39.000018,Erwin,like this
1610,2017-12-04T20:39:02.000048,Erwin,"- name: change default password

1610,2017-12-04T20:39:14.000265,Meg,"hmm, ok"
1610,2017-12-04T20:39:19.000200,Meg,this is using ansible?
1610,2017-12-04T20:39:27.000025,Erwin,the binding.py is located under splunklib-1.6.2
1610,2017-12-04T20:39:31.000175,Erwin,yes
1610,2017-12-04T20:40:07.000225,Meg,"in that case, probably <#C22DMH61M|devops> would be the best place to post since configuration as code is commonly discussed there"
1610,2017-12-04T20:40:43.000085,Erwin,"I did spend time on this one, but this is not something related to the ansible"
1610,2017-12-04T20:40:57.000179,Erwin,I'm sure this issue is coming from Python

1616,2017-12-05T09:03:34.000184,Sara,what are the units of measuremnt
1616,2017-12-05T09:03:39.000018,Patty,Right but `disk_io_counters()` returns read and write times on non-BSD systems
1616,2017-12-05T09:03:44.000524,Sara,is it per sec ?
1616,2017-12-05T09:03:51.000288,Sara,ya correct i dnt extract that value
1616,2017-12-05T09:03:58.000366,Patty,it’s per the read or write time
1616,2017-12-05T09:04:28.000159,Sara,this is the read time read_time=1540250161347L

1616,2017-12-05T09:05:31.000310,Sara,like in bsd if you type

1616,2017-12-05T09:07:17.000760,Sara,any idea

1616,2017-12-05T09:07:46.000343,Patty,just a heads up though all of this is in the `psutil` docs <https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#psutil.disk_io_counters>
1616,2017-12-05T09:08:10.000052,Sara,in bsd `disk_io_counters()` returns me read and write bytes but i am not sure about units of measurement
1616,2017-12-05T09:08:17.000641,Patty,bytes
1616,2017-12-05T09:08:29.000289,Sara,bytes /sec ?
1616,2017-12-05T09:08:31.000309,Sara,you mean
1616,2017-12-05T09:08:54.000390,Patty,"no, just bytes"
1616,2017-12-05T09:09:11.000169,Patty,it’s `bytes_read` not `bytes_read_per_second` or anything
1616,2017-12-05T09:09:45.000489,Sara,ya that is not the right approach
1616,2017-12-05T09:10:20.000404,Sara,but when it is read or write it has to per unit right ?
1616,2017-12-05T09:10:31.000016,Sara,i mean speed
1616,2017-12-05T09:10:31.000035,Meg,unit is bytes
1616,2017-12-05T09:10:33.000298,Meg,no

1616,2017-12-05T09:10:52.000278,Meg,its taking the units of bytes at the exact time you make the call
1616,2017-12-05T09:11:04.000343,Patty,"```
read_bytes: number of bytes read
write_bytes: number of bytes written

1616,2017-12-05T09:11:54.000530,Sara,hmm but not solving my purpose
1616,2017-12-05T09:12:15.000134,Sara,<@Meg> any idea how to get disk io on freebsd system ?
1616,2017-12-05T09:12:22.000043,Sara,any other way
1616,2017-12-05T09:12:37.000436,Patty,Have you looked anything up?
1616,2017-12-05T09:12:55.000462,Sara,i looked but i could not find anything
1616,2017-12-05T09:13:22.000309,Sara,there is a command in freebsd systat -vmstat
1616,2017-12-05T09:15:35.000037,Patty,You could always run that and parse the results
1616,2017-12-05T09:16:10.000464,Sara,but when you write it to file its messes up the file
1616,2017-12-05T09:16:28.000094,Sara,as the output refreshes after some interval
1616,2017-12-05T09:17:16.000093,Sara,when i just redirect it to a file
1616,2017-12-05T09:17:19.000613,Sara,and open that file
1616,2017-12-05T09:17:24.000147,Sara,it looks like this

1616,2017-12-05T09:17:51.000171,Sara,i am just trying this way systat -vmstat &gt; text
1616,2017-12-05T09:19:37.000499,Patty,I mean run it within a subprocess and get the output all within the script if you need it in python
1616,2017-12-05T09:20:03.000225,Sara,ya i have tried that
1616,2017-12-05T09:20:05.000279,Sara,does not work
1616,2017-12-05T09:20:51.000004,Sara,as i told you the command output of systat -vmstat is refreshing every now and then
1616,2017-12-05T09:21:01.000146,Patty,`iostat` has a simpler output to be parsed
1616,2017-12-05T09:21:11.000358,Patty,yes but you can capture output from a subprocess once
1616,2017-12-05T09:21:37.000528,Sara,hmm unfortunately my fsd is controlled one as dnt have iostat in it
1616,2017-12-05T09:21:42.000422,Sara,i mean bsd
1616,2017-12-05T09:22:05.000034,Sara,i dnt have iostat on my freebsd system
1616,2017-12-05T09:23:27.000535,Patty,its part of BSD base installs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1616,2017-12-05T09:24:09.000232,Sara,buts mine is customised one so not all the libs are present
1617,2017-12-05T10:14:00.000429,Glinda,Anybody ever seen this pycharm issue?
1617,2017-12-05T10:14:18.000873,Glinda,any dropdown on click is detached
1617,2017-12-05T10:14:48.000867,Glinda,"Unless I'm on my primary monitor, setup is left top, left bot (primary) right middle"
1617,2017-12-05T10:15:24.000099,Meg,nope.. that’s really weird
1617,2017-12-05T10:15:34.000066,Meg,what version pycharm?
1617,2017-12-05T10:15:44.000049,Glinda,"newest, proffessional"
1617,2017-12-05T10:16:08.000109,Glinda,before updating to 2017.3 2017.2 did same.
1617,2017-12-05T10:16:19.000853,Meg,:thinking_face:
1617,2017-12-05T10:16:27.000142,Meg,what os?
1617,2017-12-05T10:17:49.000133,Glinda,"windows, dell laptop, video connection through usb-c docking."
1617,2017-12-05T10:18:06.000331,Glinda,Only program I've had this issue with is pycharm
1617,2017-12-05T10:18:24.000031,Glinda,I looked through their issues yesterday and didn't see anything like it.
1617,2017-12-05T10:18:48.000435,Meg,I run pycharm/webstorm in the upper right one
1617,2017-12-05T10:19:01.000290,Glinda,Really frustrating because I really want to run pycharm in the top left.
1617,2017-12-05T10:19:36.000119,Meg,think it might be the dock?  can you run vga out and hdmi just for comparison?
1617,2017-12-05T10:20:59.000312,Glinda,mini display port to vga cable on right monitor; dvi -&gt; dvi on top left.
1617,2017-12-05T10:21:07.000279,Glinda,I don't have other cables around.
1617,2017-12-05T10:22:26.000447,Glinda,I'll probably submit an issue to the repository.
1617,2017-12-05T10:46:32.000285,Patty,<@Glinda> try passing -Dsun.java2d.uiScale.enabled=false VM option to PyCharm (in vmoptions file: Help &gt; Edit custom VM options).
1617,2017-12-05T10:48:04.000018,Glinda,That worked.
1617,2017-12-05T10:48:54.000453,Glinda,Even more interesting is that it didn't happen with clion
1617,2017-12-05T10:49:44.000268,Patty,"It may be because one resided on two monitors at some point, that makes Jetbrains IDEs wonky"
1617,2017-12-05T10:51:48.000605,Glinda,"Thanks for your help, been dealing with it for a while. did you use intellij search for that or something else? I searched for a bunchof variations yesterday and didn't find appropriate issues."
1617,2017-12-05T10:53:46.000532,Patty,Just googled “intellij dropdown menu not in correct location”
1617,2017-12-05T10:55:17.000536,Lashell,anyone using aws lambda?
1617,2017-12-05T10:57:58.000435,Patty,"<@Lashell> Yep, a few of us do, what’s up?"
1617,2017-12-05T11:09:17.000257,Patty,So you want to use lambda to host a proxy for all of the calls?
1617,2017-12-05T11:10:56.000107,Patty,"You’d have to set up a proper trigger, probably with an API Gateway (<https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/>) but if this is going to be proxying every call, the lambda is going to be called a lot, which is not going to be cheap"
1617,2017-12-05T11:11:17.000858,Patty,"Depending on the load, you are probably better off running a small instance on EC2 or whatever you prefer to host the proxy"
1617,2017-12-05T11:12:40.000237,Patty,"but if its low enough load, it may be cheaper for the lambda, depending on how long that lambda takes to run"
1617,2017-12-05T11:13:23.000387,Lashell,I don’t expect the calls to be too frequent. But I think you’re right that it would probably be cheaper using an ec2 instance.
1617,2017-12-05T11:13:37.000720,Patty,"Well, if it’s light enough, then it’s not cheaper"
1617,2017-12-05T11:14:52.000172,Collette,"Just don't try to setup lambda manually. Use a framework, like serverless (<https://github.com/serverless/serverless>)"
1617,2017-12-05T11:15:20.000313,Collette,"I had to do that once, for two dependent functions, using cloudformation, and it was a nightmare"
1617,2017-12-05T11:15:40.000357,Patty,thanks <@Collette> i was looking for that
1617,2017-12-05T11:15:45.000498,Lashell,Is lambda free tier eligible? I know that I could get 1 year free using the ec2 instance.
1617,2017-12-05T11:15:53.000081,Lashell,Is it the same story for using lambda

1618,2017-12-05T10:47:28.000507,Patty,if that doesnt work there are already several issues opened around this: <https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/115000134584-When-using-multiple-monitors-popup-windows-and-context-menus-are-not-positioned-correctly->

I just have a simple express server that I am using as an http proxy for an api (requests to my api will go through this proxy server so that I can hide the api key from the public).

1620,2017-12-05T11:49:13.000866,Myong,Does anyone know the best way to go about matching likeness of strings? We have a large dict of string mappings for `correct_input : known_incorrect_inputs`. I want to compare these input strings against all values for each key and determine which `correct_input` key had the most likeness based on the values it mapped to
1620,2017-12-05T11:50:33.000541,Myong,Something like sequence matcher?
1620,2017-12-05T11:58:45.000053,Meg,check out levishtein distance
1620,2017-12-05T12:12:37.000430,Myong,<@Meg> that's what seems to be most recommended. I'll look into it. Thanks also <@Joann>

1620,2017-12-05T12:17:37.000030,Patty,fuzzywuzzy is levenshtein anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1620,2017-12-05T12:17:49.000503,Myong,Might decide to basically take the value list and select highest likeness ration then compare all the picked ones and choose the best match of them all
1620,2017-12-05T12:18:00.000188,Myong,Or average the ration between the whole list?
1620,2017-12-05T12:18:03.000584,Myong,hmmmmm
1620,2017-12-05T14:16:54.000554,Frieda,there's the built-in `json` module
1620,2017-12-05T14:19:10.000554,Meg,"and if you’re using django with django rest framework, it allows you to construct the serializer definition.  much like jackson, IMO"
1620,2017-12-05T14:20:26.000143,Jeffery,Thank you - i will read the docs
1620,2017-12-05T14:25:52.000448,Meg,"json will do alot, but IIRC it has trouble with dates, so you oftentime have to make a custom handler for that"

I also found this here for mapping json into an object:

1620,2017-12-05T14:33:26.000722,Junita,I usually serialize to unix time (seconds since epoch)
1620,2017-12-05T14:34:18.000173,Junita,"kept in UTC too, it’s sort of a helpful baseline to be able to assume throughout a project"
1620,2017-12-05T14:39:47.000319,Myong,"So I got the word matching to work quite well. For the most part it picks the correct items, I do wish there were a way to change the weight of suffixes or preffixes on the word though"
1621,2017-12-05T14:16:07.000806,Jeffery,"Hello Folks :-),
is there a Json mapper like Jackson for python? Or an easy way to convert a dict into an object?

1622,2017-12-05T14:50:09.000380,Season,"Hi quick question…  I want to run a python script from cron to add/modify entries to the /etc/hosts file on Ubuntu, daily.  I have never been good at reg ex and struggling this this simple code.  I admittedly googled this syntax and don’t completely understand it.

```
with open('/tmp/hoststest', 'r') as hosts_file:
    hosts_data = hosts_file.read()
    print(hosts_data)
    new_hosts_data = re.sub(r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)',r'\1' + new_hosts_data + r'\3',hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)
    print(new_hosts_data)
```
Result
```
#StartStoreLocations
#StartStoreLocations
10.242.90.195    VN0394
#EndStoreLocations
#EndStoreLocations
```
Original Contents
```
#StartStoreLocations
10.242.90.195    VN0394
#EndStoreLocations
```
So it looks like its finding the section to replace but not replacing the start and close tags. I’ve been playing with it for an hour and cant figure it out."
1623,2017-12-05T15:16:34.000231,Sirena,have you considered dns instead?
1623,2017-12-05T15:17:33.000255,Season,:slightly_smiling_face: I knew someone would mention that. Yes I would love to use DNS but in this situation I dont have that control
1623,2017-12-05T15:19:48.000101,Season,"this will serve my needs but for my education, I’d like to understand the regex better"
1623,2017-12-05T15:22:11.000549,Frieda,"so the pattern is `r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)'`. what does that pattern do, as you understand it, <@Season>?"
1623,2017-12-05T15:26:03.000293,Sirena,"um, I don't think new_hosts_data is defined inside the re.sub function?"
1623,2017-12-05T15:27:00.000616,Sirena,"this is pretty convoluted, would you be able to transmit a diff and then use `patch` to apply it to your /etc/hosts?"
1623,2017-12-05T15:30:23.000536,Season,"its there and sort of working, I jsut must have a problem with my regex because its putting the data inside the file but not replacing the starting and ending tags.  so it replaces 
```
#StartStoreLocations
10.242.90.195    VN0394
#EndStoreLocations
```
With
```
#StartStoreLocations
#StartStoreLocations
10.242.90.195    VN0394
#EndStoreLocations
#EndStoreLocations
```"
1623,2017-12-05T15:31:01.000103,Sirena,"it seems to me like new_hosts_data already has the tags, so you're inserting them between the literal tags in your regex"
1623,2017-12-05T15:31:05.000250,Sirena,that's just a guess
1623,2017-12-05T15:31:57.000027,Season,yes that exactly what happening.  I just cant figure out how to fix it
1623,2017-12-05T15:32:27.000034,Sirena,"```new_hosts_data = '#nhdtag\ninfo\#nhdtag'

yields:
#StartStoreLocations
#nhdtag
info
#nhdtag
#EndStoreLocations```"
1623,2017-12-05T15:32:51.000269,Sirena,you'll fix it with
1623,2017-12-05T15:33:11.000404,Sirena,"`new_hosts_data = re.sub(r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)`"
1623,2017-12-05T15:33:21.000750,Sirena,if you want to keep the new_hosts_data tags
1623,2017-12-05T15:33:57.000261,Sirena,"if you want to keep the literals but throw away the new_hosts_data tags, then I'd suggest preprocessing new_hosts_data to drop those lines"
1623,2017-12-05T15:34:33.000125,Frieda,does `#StartStoreLocations` or `#EndStoreLocations` ever change?
1623,2017-12-05T15:35:35.000051,Season,<@Frieda> no
1623,2017-12-05T15:36:04.000703,Season,<@Shavonda> that worked except it wiped out the rest of the file with the new data
1623,2017-12-05T15:36:34.000074,Sirena,? you said the original file only had 3 lines
1623,2017-12-05T15:36:40.000344,Sirena,at least in your example
1623,2017-12-05T15:37:18.000276,Season,I simplified it. there are other entries in my hosts file.  I want to update those.
1623,2017-12-05T15:37:43.000287,Frieda,"if they never change, make them non-matching groups and only replace the parts in between"
1623,2017-12-05T15:37:54.000007,Frieda,"at it is now, it looks like you're always copying them back in"
1623,2017-12-05T15:38:12.000151,Season,"thats why I was placing the entries between those tags.  here is my current code with your tweaks

```
with open('/etc/hosts', 'r') as hosts_file:
    hosts_data = hosts_file.read()
    if '#StartStoreLocations' in open('/etc/hosts').read():
        new_hosts_file = re.sub(r'(#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+)(.*)(#EndStoreLocations)', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)
    else:
        new_hosts_file = hosts_data + new_hosts_data
    
with open('/etc/hosts', 'w') as outfile:
    outfile.write(new_hosts_file)
```"
1623,2017-12-05T15:40:37.000383,Season,"<@Frieda> agreed,  thats what I want to do but I am literally brain dead when it comes to regex.  I cant figure out the syntax, which is why I posted here."
1623,2017-12-05T15:46:51.000371,Sirena,"if new_hosts_data has the tags, just do:
`new_hosts_file = re.sub(r'#StartStoreLocations.*?\n+(.*)#EndStoreLocations', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)`"
1623,2017-12-05T15:48:44.000220,Sirena,"I personally don't really like that `.*?` because it's slippery, so I might change it to `new_hosts_file = re.sub(r'#StartStoreLocations\s*(.*)#EndStoreLocations', new_hosts_data ,hosts_data, flags=re.M|re.DOTALL)`"
1623,2017-12-05T15:49:24.000039,Sirena,"but if you like it, it's sorta personal preference"
1623,2017-12-05T15:49:44.000260,Season,I like what works at this point :slightly_smiling_face:  trying to wrap my head around it still
1623,2017-12-05T15:51:09.000053,Sirena,"can even drop the perens around `(.*)` since you're not using the backrefs any more, but I think they make it easier to read"
1623,2017-12-05T15:51:46.000681,Season,<@Shavonda> works PERFECTLY  thanks!  Now I need to make sure I understand it.  Ive been coding off and on for 20 years and regex has always made my head hurt
1623,2017-12-05T15:52:18.000104,Sirena,"yeah, I wrote a decent bit of perl for like 4 years, but there's a reason people sometimes call regexes a ""write only language"""

1623,2017-12-05T15:54:53.000150,Season,I don’t use reg much so whenever I looks at it my eyes are like wtf am I looking at.  I’ll go watch a lynda video or something sometime soon
1623,2017-12-05T16:05:42.000765,Sirena,"yah, I sorta recommend against it. I don't know where your input comes from or anything, but as a cron job you might just consider transmitting diffs around and apply them using `patch`"
1623,2017-12-05T16:06:03.000445,Sirena,it's a pretty well established and understood format with tools built around it
1623,2017-12-05T16:07:11.000747,Sirena,"in your case, your format is pretty straightforward, and hosts files already have a format that generally will avoid any weird regex problems, so it probably doesn't matter"
1623,2017-12-05T16:12:57.000174,Vita,"Anyone have an example (for the front end mainly) of a way to organize a bunch of different reports? I want to make them easier to find, but I am not sure what I should use for it"

1626,2017-12-05T18:37:21.000273,Arlene,"`| jq '.[] | .[] | select(.name==""${NAME}"") | .id')""` tried this as well and no luck"
1626,2017-12-05T18:37:57.000127,Glinda,"Also not sure you are paring all your quotes, (which order they are nested in). you have two sets of each."

1626,2017-12-05T18:38:46.000057,Arlene,this works
1626,2017-12-05T18:40:26.000194,Arlene,I just cant seem to be able use the variable instead of bar
1626,2017-12-05T18:40:29.000452,Arlene,jq bombs out
1626,2017-12-05T18:50:48.000001,Glinda,"I don't know anything about jq, are you trying to parse the string in python for the value `$NAME` and `$TOKEN`? What is the actual string you want ID to look like?"
1626,2017-12-05T18:51:56.000215,Arlene,"<@Glinda> this is in shell, ID will look like this ID=int"
1626,2017-12-05T18:52:00.000070,Arlene,ID=1234
1626,2017-12-05T18:52:19.000080,Arlene,Token is just a token
1626,2017-12-05T18:52:32.000014,Arlene,"It works when I hardcode the name=""bar"" part"
1626,2017-12-05T18:52:45.000161,Arlene,but I seem to be having some string escaping issues i think
1626,2017-12-05T18:52:57.000340,Marcie,shell variables dont get parsed in single quotes `'`
1626,2017-12-05T18:54:15.000297,Arlene,"`select(.name==""$NAME"")` this wont parse the variabke $NAME either?"
1626,2017-12-05T18:54:28.000133,Marcie,"this should technically work:

1626,2017-12-05T18:55:45.000221,Marcie,ahh the fun of bash
1626,2017-12-05T18:55:57.000399,Arlene,i spent like 30 min on that one line lol
1626,2017-12-05T18:56:31.000020,Arlene,everything works fine when its hardcoded. :disappointed:
1626,2017-12-05T18:58:39.000163,Staci,"Alright, I got a question I'm hoping one of you might be able to point me in a better direction.

I'm trying to identify an item based on the name given in an a Description. There are about 25-30 possible items and each possible item has anywhere from 2-20 possible spelling/spacing/wordorder/special characters combinations in the description. For example something like this:

```
ICE_WATER = [""ice/water shield"", ""i/w shield 1 sq"", ""i/w shield 1sq"", ""i/w"",
""i/w shield - surface area"", ""i/w valley"", ""i/w shield"", ]
```

There are overlaps in the description names with other items, so I don't think using any ""distance"" or other search algo will get me accurate results. Hence why I've resorted to exact name matching. (If you disagree maybe I could give you some more examples and I could look into it more.)

originally, I put these all the possible names in one large dictionary with the function to call as the value. I didn't really like how long and ugly the list was and difficult to maintain (as I find new possible items or terms are added) so I'm wondering how ugly/slow using a long list of `if/elif desc in ITEM_LIST` might affect my program (as long as it doesn't add more than a second I think I'll deal with it) or if there is another alternate (possibly even obvious) method I can use to identify these items (each with different calculations that need to be performed). And route them to the appropriate (now) methods."
1626,2017-12-05T18:59:00.000152,Arlene,"You mean, curl request get response"
1626,2017-12-05T18:59:08.000232,Arlene,than in other variable do the jq stuff?
1626,2017-12-05T19:01:33.000072,Staci,"I'll probably clean it up to where I'm only assigning 2 or 3 attributes per item rather than a separate method for each, but I still need a better way to identify them."
1626,2017-12-05T19:01:56.000080,Arlene,it be nice if .py had switch statement
1626,2017-12-05T19:02:02.000059,Arlene,i think it make this easier
1626,2017-12-05T19:02:14.000123,Arlene,but maybe you can write your own switch
1626,2017-12-05T19:02:26.000068,Staci,You can make a switch with a dictionary
1626,2017-12-05T19:02:37.000430,Staci,That's essentially what I had before
1626,2017-12-05T19:02:45.000273,Marcie,"<@Arlene> from testing this might do it
```ID=""$(curl -X GET $PLATFORM_URL/foo \
                     -H ""x-cookie: token=$TOKEN"" \
                    | jq "".[] | .[] | select(.name==\""$NAME\"") | .id"")""```"
1626,2017-12-05T19:03:17.000202,Marcie,"as this works:
```NAME=foobar
echo ""$(cat ./test.json | jq "".[] | select(.name==\""${NAME}\"")"" )""```"
1626,2017-12-05T19:03:20.000122,Staci,I guess I could put all of the descriptions in a table with their appropriate attributes and query the table
1626,2017-12-05T19:04:24.000210,Arlene,<@Marcie> :boom: that works
1626,2017-12-05T19:04:30.000215,Arlene,Oh man I am tired today.
1626,2017-12-05T19:04:31.000063,Arlene,lol
1626,2017-12-05T19:04:39.000320,Arlene,<@Marcie> Thanks for taking the time sir!
1626,2017-12-05T19:05:07.000135,Marcie,<@Staci> you could have descriptions and associated calls in a dict
1626,2017-12-05T19:07:11.000141,Marcie,"something like
```checks = {
    'ice_water': [""ice/water shield"", ""i/w shield 1 sq"", ""i/w shield 1sq"", ""i/w"",
""i/w shield - surface area"", ""i/w valley"", ""i/w shield""]
}

def identify_item(self):
    for func_name, attributes in checks.items():
        if self.desc in attributes:
            getattr(self, func_name)()
            break```"
1626,2017-12-05T19:08:04.000246,Marcie,though i'd probably move away from the whole bunch of methods on self to more of a composition style in general
1626,2017-12-05T19:09:09.000235,Marcie,yeah thats my normal flow
1626,2017-12-05T19:14:48.000099,Staci,"Yea, that is my plan, I just need a way of identifying the items so I can assign the appropriate attributes"
1626,2017-12-05T19:15:41.000173,Staci,"I think I may have talked myself into just creating a table, that way it won't require a code change if/when I need to add items in the future"
1626,2017-12-05T19:15:50.000039,Staci,or descriptions rather
1626,2017-12-05T19:16:34.000373,Staci,but I appreciate your feedback <@Marcie> I like that pretty well
1627,2017-12-05T20:56:59.000115,Ora,"Hello, so i want to write a script that reads from an excel sheet made by my collegues, and  based on that, will send some mails (reading both the mailadress to sent to and the mail contents from the spreadsheet). So with my limited knowledge, i feel i have few ways to go around that, and i want to pick up the least painful direction. So:"
1627,2017-12-05T20:57:08.000264,Ora,"1. is it easier to use pandas or openpyxl and work directly on the spreadsheet, or convert .xls to .csv and go with that?
2. The actual mailsending thourgh smtplib seems pretty straitghforward, but i would like to use the local account to which my collegue is logged in on thunderbird - i fear it might cause troble (security). Also, how difficult would using an ssl certificate be?
2. Ideally, i would like to make an executable from the script, so that my collegues can easily use that on their PC. Can you recommend pyinstaller?"

1636,2017-12-06T10:33:52.000508,Winnie,"<@Ivonne> 
You
&gt; notifies me when files are changed
but also
&gt;  I can get notified ONLY when files are NOT CHANGED OR CREATED"
1636,2017-12-06T10:34:05.000509,Winnie,can you clarify?
1636,2017-12-06T10:37:08.000824,Ivonne,"Yeah sure. Script I am running is monitoring my folder. In that folder i have files tar.gz that are being updated every 5 sec. In my script I get notifications about every change that happens in specified folder. Now, because I wont to get those notifications on email, I need to rewrite script so it doesn't notify on every change because my email would be spammed. I need to modify it in the way that notifies me ONLY when files in specified folder are not being changed/updated or created so I would know when my other script(that is making those files to be updated) has stopped working."
1636,2017-12-06T10:38:28.000588,Sirena,are these like rolling log files?
1636,2017-12-06T10:38:51.000210,Sirena,do you maybe only want a notification when a new file gets created?
1636,2017-12-06T10:39:17.000394,Scot,Sounds like he just wants to be notified when his script crashes
1636,2017-12-06T10:42:37.000589,Sirena,Could just put an atexit handler on the script
1636,2017-12-06T10:42:56.000202,Scot,What happens if the host crashes?
1636,2017-12-06T10:43:11.000395,Scot,Not saying it's relevant in this case
1636,2017-12-06T10:43:15.000660,Sirena,then the script-monitoring script probably went with it
1636,2017-12-06T10:43:21.000096,Sirena,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1636,2017-12-06T10:43:43.000483,Sirena,need a little more specifics if we're going to go down this particular rabbit hole
1636,2017-12-06T10:44:28.000443,Ciera,I think it might be easier to use a process manager to monitor the first script
1636,2017-12-06T10:44:43.000213,Ciera,than check if files are being created/modified
1636,2017-12-06T10:45:13.000354,Sirena,depends on how the first script typically stops working
1636,2017-12-06T10:55:30.000685,Ivonne,"I need to monitor files, not script guys."
1636,2017-12-06T10:56:30.000161,Ivonne,Script can be runing but the server that are downloading files from can be busy or at full capacity so my files wouldn't get updated and changeed
1636,2017-12-06T10:57:13.000762,Ivonne,I just need to modify script which i've put above in the link so it can notifies me when the files are NOT updated
1636,2017-12-06T10:57:34.000152,Meg,sounds like you should define the files you want to be notified of updates with a unique prefix or suffix
1636,2017-12-06T10:58:02.000448,Meg,and your script will check all modified files for that
1636,2017-12-06T10:58:08.000571,Meg,"if it matches, send an email"
1636,2017-12-06T11:00:17.000630,Ivonne,"I am monitoring whole folder, and i can get notifications on every change. Now I just need tomake little change to notifies me when the files are not changing but I don't know how to do that"
1636,2017-12-06T11:00:49.000186,Meg,use an interval
1636,2017-12-06T11:00:55.000127,Sirena,are you certain there will not be any files there which are _normally_ not changing?
1636,2017-12-06T11:01:00.000527,Meg,check every 30 seconds or so for changes
1636,2017-12-06T11:01:21.000003,Sirena,"yah, just stat the files and check for update times more than X seconds old"
1636,2017-12-06T11:05:33.000262,Sirena,"```for file in file_list:
  if (os.path.getmtime(file) - time.time()) &gt; 30:
    print 'it has been more than 30 seconds since {} was updated'.format(file)```"
1636,2017-12-06T11:05:37.000578,Sirena,something like that
1636,2017-12-06T11:08:25.000675,Ivonne,Well I think this is helpfull but before this I would need to make a function that states whenever the file is created it should be added in the file_list so I can iterate within it. Right?
1636,2017-12-06T11:09:52.000548,Ivonne,I was more looking to find some simple solution to modify watchdog
1636,2017-12-06T11:09:58.000271,Ivonne,script above
1636,2017-12-06T11:18:34.000179,Sirena,"I don't know how many file notification events you were getting before, or how long you want to wait between checking for activity, but this is probably more efficient than the event based system"
1636,2017-12-06T11:19:50.000382,Sirena,"the problem with the watchdog is that any event you get will always be the brand new, so you won't really be able to use it to check how 'stale' a file is unless you add some pretty wacky logic"
1636,2017-12-06T11:20:09.000021,Sirena,you _could_ use the watchdog to build up your file list and add new files to the list any time you catch a file creation event
1636,2017-12-06T11:27:34.000082,Johana,you could also use something else that is built for watching files. you may be able to configure syncthing’s inotify to watch the folder and hit the syncthing rest api. <https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/events.html>
1636,2017-12-06T13:45:26.000095,Jama,"Guys, I have an API client and I want to extend it to track all API calls and keep logs of each call in an SQLite DB.

1636,2017-12-06T13:47:39.000023,Jama,Whats the best way of doing that? Can I used decorators on those functions for this? Can decorators interact the variables in the decorated function scope? Or do I have to extend those functions and inject the logging/tracking stuff before the return for each of the functions that call these?
1636,2017-12-06T13:58:16.000539,Myong,You could create a decorator for sure

1636,2017-12-06T14:34:21.000179,Myong,Yeah so basically you need to figure out what python interpreter it's using
1636,2017-12-06T14:34:55.000344,Cecille,how would I go about doing that?
1636,2017-12-06T14:36:46.000216,Sirena,"maybe ```import sys

1636,2017-12-06T14:36:57.000007,Sirena,?

1636,2017-12-06T14:38:22.000142,Seema,"anaconda installs a pseudo-environment, I find it easier to use the whole thing in a virtualenv"
1636,2017-12-06T14:38:45.000218,Seema,then it will conda install things into its own path and that may or may not be the same sys.path as the repl
1636,2017-12-06T14:39:11.000483,Cecille,"Thats fine, I just need to temporarily use these packages for some projects"
1636,2017-12-06T14:39:29.000310,Cecille,If I need to install everything into the psuedo enviornment that is fine
1636,2017-12-06T14:39:47.000041,Cecille,Should I be using the conda cli then and installing the packages?
1636,2017-12-06T14:39:57.000366,Seema,you can cd anaconda and then source bin/activate then go pip install crazy
1636,2017-12-06T14:40:37.000285,Seema,I've had too many of the issues you've described and I find doing a clean anaconda environment is the cleanest way for me to manage the different packages (and their installs)

1650,2017-12-07T10:27:47.000641,Myong,Oh that's interesting. Friends company down here in Florida does a lot of work with embedded devices and IoT. I don't think they work with LoRa in particular but they have some proprietary devices they implement
1650,2017-12-07T10:33:35.000240,Myong,For xlsxwriter is there a function similar to `writerow()` in the `csv` module where I can simply pass in a list of row items?\
1650,2017-12-07T10:34:02.000191,Myong,I guess I can always do something like...

1650,2017-12-07T10:43:19.000625,Myong,It looks like it's really modular so you use what you need
1650,2017-12-07T10:45:17.000002,Myong,Wow you legitimately just add a list of list to an ordered dict and it does everything else for you

1652,2017-12-07T12:01:50.000907,Glinda,it doesn't like the `ws` in on_open.
1652,2017-12-07T12:02:32.000613,Seema,in the comments because of scope?
1652,2017-12-07T12:04:54.000546,Glinda,`parameter 'ws' is not used`
1652,2017-12-07T12:05:12.000315,Seema,"<@Glinda> you can suppress individual types of error by pressing alt+enter in PyCharm and choosing ""Ignore errors like this"""

The check E133 is mutually exclusive with check E123. Use switch --hang-closing to report E133 instead of E123.

1652,2017-12-07T12:08:26.000238,Glinda,come again?
1652,2017-12-07T12:09:45.000796,Seema,"errr getting my style and my zen mixed up, they used Zen of Python to justify their Pep8"
1652,2017-12-07T12:13:13.000358,Cordie,I need to find certain identifiers(datetime related keywords) in JQL (jira query language) and possibly remove them without breaking syntax. How do I go about parsing this JQL? Is there a well known tool or a better approach?
1652,2017-12-07T12:13:17.000224,Glinda,"```# noinspection PyUnusedLocal

1652,2017-12-07T12:32:48.000262,Jeffery,@leo where are datetime saved? Changelog?
1652,2017-12-07T12:33:03.000111,Cordie,no for example
1652,2017-12-07T12:33:44.000068,Jeffery,It depends. In my Opinion you can‘t find all via jql
1652,2017-12-07T12:33:53.000140,Cordie,jql=“label=‘string’ AND blah &gt; ‘2017-10-11’
1652,2017-12-07T12:34:12.000218,Cordie,i want to remove “blah &gt; ‘2017-10-11’”
1652,2017-12-07T12:34:32.000243,Cordie,but it is not as simple as using just a regex
1652,2017-12-07T12:35:18.000794,Cordie,i think the link you provided is more to do with working with jira’s api
1652,2017-12-07T12:35:30.000228,Cordie,my problem is more on parsing a language…
1652,2017-12-07T12:42:43.000088,Jeffery,"I see. I can‘t really help you.
But just of curiosity - what is the use case?

Who wants to do this change? And through which interface?"
1652,2017-12-07T12:47:39.000235,Glinda,<@Cordie> are these values strings or datetimes?
1652,2017-12-07T12:48:45.000335,Cordie,<@Jeffery> it’s just an app I am building. Jira has a kanban board and i am importing the jql that populates the board
1652,2017-12-07T12:49:08.000028,Cordie,<@Glinda> well i need to cover all hahaha
1653,2017-12-07T13:26:39.000390,Patty,I don’t really see the value of letting you know there are unused params when it can simplify functions or signal you’re doing something off ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1653,2017-12-07T13:34:45.000262,Patty,why would you be writing functions with unused params anyway?
1653,2017-12-07T13:35:43.000258,Myong,"Yeah, I agree"
1653,2017-12-07T13:39:57.000185,Cecille,Anyone here use jupyter notebooks  &amp; anaconda to manage their environments? I’ve managed to create and manage my packages using the enviornments from anaconda but I can’t seem to get jupyter notebooks to read from the right enviornment too
1653,2017-12-07T13:40:22.000270,Glinda,"joe, it's something with `websocket`"

1653,2017-12-07T13:40:29.000571,Cecille,I’ve legit been stuck for 2 days now on this issue :cry:
1653,2017-12-07T13:42:21.000460,Glinda,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37085665/in-which-conda-environment-is-jupyter-executing>
1653,2017-12-07T13:43:13.000230,Glinda,I'm a little out of practice with jupyter/ conda but me switching away from those two was partly due to issues with virtual environments.
1653,2017-12-07T13:43:48.000587,Patty,<@Glinda> if it’s `on_open` then you just do `ws.on_open = on_open` and drop the `ws` argument since it’s not used. it’s not required for websockets
1653,2017-12-07T13:44:00.000763,Cecille,Dude it fucking blows <@Glinda> but every data scientist I run into uses it :disappointed:
1653,2017-12-07T13:44:40.000129,Glinda,So just drop ws?
1653,2017-12-07T13:44:43.000344,Patty,yep
1653,2017-12-07T13:44:49.000294,Patty,same with in `on_close`
1653,2017-12-07T13:44:53.000343,Glinda,"Hmm, must have been a python 2 thing"
1653,2017-12-07T13:45:07.000487,Glinda,Bunch of what I was doing was ported from python 2 :confused:
1653,2017-12-07T13:45:20.000650,Glinda,Aite thank you.
1653,2017-12-07T13:45:58.000408,Patty,"if any argument _must_ be there and isn’t used, naming it `_` is also a preferred method"
1653,2017-12-07T13:46:42.000097,Glinda,<@Cecille> the problem from transitioning from anaconda to pip is that you're going to run into issues with numpy/ pandas.
1653,2017-12-07T13:46:50.000062,Glinda,conda is great for installing those packages.
1653,2017-12-07T13:47:26.000661,Glinda,"And it's really not difficult for someone who has experience with python to do it, but dealing with the binaries _while_ learning python and wanting todo data science is probably the biggest reason I see people pushc onda."
1653,2017-12-07T13:48:18.000552,Glinda,"If you have a student id, you can get pycharm pro for free and they are working their darndest to steal that data science money from spyder/ conda."
1653,2017-12-07T13:50:04.000450,Glinda,"Give me a second, I want to see if the new changes make it easy to deal with numpy/ pandas in a windows"
1653,2017-12-07T13:53:19.000566,Patty,"btw <@Glinda> you’re right, the `ws` lib is going to provide that argument by default, so `_` may be better if you aren’t using it"
1653,2017-12-07T13:53:57.000593,Glinda,"Thanks man,  the main reason for asking isn't finding a working solution but best practice."
1653,2017-12-07T13:54:58.000141,Glinda,It's probably better to treat the socket as a class.
1653,2017-12-07T13:56:29.000597,Glinda,"<@Cecille> So I opened a new pycharm project. Typed `ctrl +alt+ s` and created a new virtual environment and applied to this project. Then I  created a folder with these imports. ```import pandas as pd

1654,2017-12-07T14:11:21.000464,Myong,Hry guys just found a small bug
1654,2017-12-07T14:11:55.000412,Myong,In inserting rows of data I have a small thing for inserting `None` in cells which are missing data in order to keep formatting in order for headers and what not
1654,2017-12-07T14:12:45.000724,Myong,"But my issue is that in some cases when there are two or more cells of data missing, the way I am inserting the data into excel is as such"
1654,2017-12-07T14:13:14.000349,Myong,nvm cant put the code
1654,2017-12-07T14:13:33.000274,Myong,"but, my question is, is there a way to order a list based on the order of another list?"
1654,2017-12-07T14:14:07.000420,Myong,"so if I have something like `[""hello"", ""bye"", ""ok""] and [""ok"", ""bye""]`"
1654,2017-12-07T14:14:25.000589,Myong,"I want the resulting list to be `[""bye"", ""ok""]`"
1654,2017-12-07T14:14:44.000029,Myong,Wait I think I got it actually
1654,2017-12-07T14:21:25.000535,Myong,Figured it ou!
1654,2017-12-07T14:21:27.000721,Myong,out
1654,2017-12-07T14:22:41.000332,Glinda,nice job
1654,2017-12-07T14:23:01.000043,Glinda,Do you use windows 64 python 3?
1655,2017-12-07T14:41:54.000282,Myong,"Uh oh, another issue :confused:"
1655,2017-12-07T14:42:35.000429,Glinda,?
1655,2017-12-07T14:42:52.000097,Glinda,Maybe take a step back and explain the problem
1655,2017-12-07T14:45:14.000221,Myong,So basically I have an excel file I'm generating
1655,2017-12-07T14:45:38.000690,Myong,Now the response from the GET I make to this API send me XML with a bunch of nodes that have child nodes
1655,2017-12-07T14:45:48.000441,Myong,I grab the text from the child nodes in the order which it appears
1655,2017-12-07T14:46:04.000146,Myong,But in some cases the data doesnt contain every node which the header contains
1655,2017-12-07T14:46:28.000683,Myong,so say the header covers 38 columns cause it can contain 38 different pieces of data
1655,2017-12-07T14:46:46.000638,Myong,Sometimes I only get 35 from any given node
1655,2017-12-07T14:46:53.000297,Myong,so I'm missing data
1655,2017-12-07T14:47:00.000261,Myong,But I wanna insert it under the correct header
1655,2017-12-07T14:47:18.000595,Myong,"so I have a list of headers and the headers are the ""id"" nodes which are always included in the response"
1655,2017-12-07T14:47:39.000002,Myong,"I also store each different main node as a dictionary, and place the dictionary in a list"
1655,2017-12-07T14:47:43.000284,Glinda,Can you show an example of the response?
1655,2017-12-07T14:48:04.000101,Myong,I can not actually
1655,2017-12-07T14:48:05.000401,Glinda,"Even just the header list with id, and another row list of id."
1655,2017-12-07T14:48:27.000012,Myong,I cant do snippets on this computer
1655,2017-12-07T14:48:37.000231,Myong,I would just post my code if i could
1655,2017-12-07T14:48:47.000179,Glinda,snippets?
1655,2017-12-07T14:49:21.000018,Glinda,Do you not have `` key?
1655,2017-12-07T14:51:51.000207,Glinda,So since you say order of nodes matter you get the header data first right? So can you get the key from each header item and use it later to match the column from the rows of data?
1655,2017-12-07T14:53:29.000605,Myong,Yeah basically I have all possible headers and theyre in the proper order
1655,2017-12-07T14:54:02.000130,Myong,I put the masterlist of headers and also the current headers for the current set in a `set()`
1655,2017-12-07T14:54:13.000773,Myong,then I take the difference of one set minus the others
1655,2017-12-07T14:54:25.000179,Glinda,Any chance you tried to use a dictionary?
1655,2017-12-07T14:54:27.000221,Myong,to get the headers which arent in the data set
1655,2017-12-07T14:54:35.000210,Myong,"I am using a dictionary, yes"
1655,2017-12-07T14:54:41.000082,Myong,When I first filter the data
1655,2017-12-07T14:55:34.000147,Myong,But I still have to check if the key exists in the data and if it does not I dont add a key to it for that header
1655,2017-12-07T14:55:46.000540,Myong,debugging right now i have one id i know is messing up
1655,2017-12-07T14:56:29.000084,Myong,I think I know actually what is happening
1655,2017-12-07T14:56:31.000069,Glinda,"Without seeing your data and what you want to happen, or code. It's pretty hard for me to help more."
1655,2017-12-07T14:56:37.000207,Myong,Yeah I know
1655,2017-12-07T14:56:42.000411,Myong,But I think I know the issue
1655,2017-12-07T14:56:45.000216,Myong,if there are like 3 keys
1655,2017-12-07T14:57:01.000334,Glinda,Explain why you are using `set()` to filter?
1655,2017-12-07T14:57:18.000331,Myong,with set you can use `set1 - set2`
1655,2017-12-07T14:57:21.000343,Myong,so like
1655,2017-12-07T14:57:31.000685,Glinda,set doesn't preserve order
1655,2017-12-07T14:58:03.000137,Myong,I reorder it
1655,2017-12-07T14:58:08.000750,Myong,with filter
1655,2017-12-07T14:58:17.000303,Myong,`filter()` based on index of headers
1655,2017-12-07T14:58:19.000568,Myong,but the issue is this
1655,2017-12-07T14:58:22.000153,Myong,just realize
1655,2017-12-07T14:58:48.000332,Myong,when inserting into a list with different size than the main header list so like inserting into a size 35 list based on indexes of size 38 list
1655,2017-12-07T15:00:35.000053,Myong,"So if I have `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` as a main list"
1655,2017-12-07T15:00:47.000537,Glinda,"Okay so if you wishto preserve order and subtract items from list_2 from list_1 this is one way you can do it:
```list_1 = []
list_2 = []


list_removed = []
for item in list_1:
    if not item in list_2:
        list_removed.append(item)
        ```"
1655,2017-12-07T15:02:18.000096,Glinda,"If you wish to add a space to the list when you remove: ```list_1 = []
list_2 = []

list_removed = []
for item in list_1:
    if not item in list_2:
        list_removed.append(item)
    else:
        list_removed.append(None)```"
1655,2017-12-07T15:03:28.000104,Myong,It seems mostly to be an issue when two missing cells are next to each other towards the end of the list
1655,2017-12-07T15:03:37.000039,Myong,and there is also a missing cell towards the beginning
1655,2017-12-07T15:03:44.000095,Glinda,"This will also work: `map(lambda x:x if not x in list_2 else None, list_1)`"
1655,2017-12-07T15:06:19.000483,Glinda,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [1,7,8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(map(lambda x:x if not x in b else None, a))
[None, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, None, None]```"
1655,2017-12-07T15:06:26.000357,Glinda,Actually that works. forgot the not
1655,2017-12-07T15:16:53.000146,Harlan,"<@Myong> So you're receiving XML, and ultimately you want to build a spreadsheet with it? I'm assuming you're generating a csv file that you're opening in excel, is that right?"
1655,2017-12-07T15:17:24.000148,Myong,"Yes, I can do pretty much everything but there is an issue with formatting it correctly"
1655,2017-12-07T15:17:31.000653,Harlan,It seems like you're manually generating the csv yourself.
1655,2017-12-07T15:17:50.000348,Myong,It's pretty complicated to explain you can read back but for now im just debugging it
1655,2017-12-07T15:18:29.000123,Harlan,Have you tried <https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter>
1655,2017-12-07T15:19:45.000560,Harlan,"If you can get the XML into a dict, you can throw each one into a DictWriter object and it will take care of everything for you."
1655,2017-12-07T15:22:08.000296,Myong,I got it
1655,2017-12-07T15:22:24.000176,Myong,I think it actually worked the whole time and I looked at the wrong file :upside_down_face:
1655,2017-12-07T15:36:49.000164,Myong,Okay now I found the issue
1655,2017-12-07T15:37:00.000133,Myong,It's in deciding what order to insert the items
1656,2017-12-07T15:19:01.000104,Harlan,you can even specify a restval to fill in gaps where you don't have a value for the field.
1657,2017-12-07T16:05:42.000088,Cecille,<@Glinda> got it!
1657,2017-12-07T16:07:20.000268,Glinda,What did you did up doing?
1657,2017-12-07T16:09:34.000635,Cecille,Found a stackoverflow which pointed to a conda package called ``` nb_conda``` that you need to install
1657,2017-12-07T16:10:05.000239,Cecille,Which is also in the docs butttt they don’t mention that you need to install nb_conda  on the machine and the env
1657,2017-12-07T16:10:15.000178,Cecille,"or maybe im just a scrub, who knows. But it works!"
1658,2017-12-07T18:15:32.000028,Sabra,I can’t find the function definition for settimeout in <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/socket.py>
1658,2017-12-07T18:15:41.000070,Sabra,where is settimeout defined?
1658,2017-12-07T18:24:12.000283,Patty,<@Sabra> <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/d3187158c09cf899e9849f335bdff10594209167/Modules/socketmodule.c#L2584>
1658,2017-12-07T18:26:59.000195,Sabra,Thanks <@Patty>
1658,2017-12-07T18:27:15.000245,Patty,No problem!
1659,2017-12-07T19:27:17.000042,Bette,"Guys in python lists there is a method called insert ,can someone clarify can it insert or single element or multiple elements in to the list ?"
1659,2017-12-07T19:34:30.000095,Patty,"`list.extend()` can take an iterable and add all of that to the list, <@Bette>"
1659,2017-12-07T19:34:45.000217,Patty,<https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists>
1659,2017-12-07T19:39:06.000299,Marcie,an extend with an index is a bit trickier to do but also possible
1659,2017-12-07T19:39:48.000163,Marcie,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; base_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
&gt;&gt;&gt; insert_0_list = ['1', '2', '3']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [base_list.insert(1, item) for item in reversed(insert_0_list)]
[None, None, None]
&gt;&gt;&gt; base_list
['a', '1', '2', '3', 'b', 'c', 'd']```"
1659,2017-12-07T19:44:08.000191,Bette,"@joe  it will allow single argument like append or multiple argument like extend that's my question,hope you got it"
1659,2017-12-07T19:44:24.000077,Marcie,single argument
1659,2017-12-07T19:44:37.000267,Bette,Thanks Johnson :+1: 
1660,2017-12-07T20:56:53.000108,Toby,So im not sure if im doing it wrong or just not understanding but how do you make a server using asyncio? I dont get how you write the web handlers
1660,2017-12-07T21:02:34.000137,Johana,i also think requests now supports asyncio.
1660,2017-12-07T21:02:45.000186,Johana,let me find a link.
1660,2017-12-07T21:03:10.000045,Toby,"Like in node and express you use app.get/app.post then the url after the server url, isnt there a sinple way to do this in python?"
1660,2017-12-07T21:09:54.000131,Patty,I find <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> to be the most express-esque python server
1660,2017-12-07T21:11:17.000153,Toby,"Well their home page is nice haha, looks very node/express-y"
1660,2017-12-07T21:12:48.000206,Patty,<@Tangela> when you use the `with cursor` context manager it closes the cursor after the code block
1660,2017-12-07T21:13:38.000167,Patty,so you need to move all `cursor.execute()` statements to be within that context manager
1660,2017-12-07T21:17:40.000086,Winnifred,<@Patty> :taco:
1660,2017-12-07T21:18:09.000228,Winnifred,(you beat me to the answer)
1660,2017-12-07T21:18:13.000112,Winnifred,:stuck_out_tongue:
1660,2017-12-07T21:18:31.000089,Toby,"<@Patty> any help on running flask? Haha
Their example on how to run it doesnt work"
1660,2017-12-07T21:19:17.000057,Patty,"sure I can help, let’s take it to <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> to be in the right channel"
1661,2017-12-07T21:02:16.000131,Johana,you would need to use the equivalent of something like requests which is aiohttp.
1661,2017-12-07T21:17:57.000176,Patty,thanks <@Winnifred> :slightly_smiling_face:
1662,2017-12-07T21:17:03.000073,Tangela,Thanks @joe worked perfectly
1663,2017-12-07T22:24:39.000089,Glinda,What exceptions are you worried about?
1663,2017-12-07T22:28:09.000059,Tangela,string too long and invalid chars...
1663,2017-12-07T22:36:36.000041,Glinda,You kind of have a lot of things happening in this single statement.
1663,2017-12-07T22:37:21.000162,Glinda,"What do you want to happen when you encounter 1. string too long, and 2. invalid chars?"
1663,2017-12-07T22:40:40.000105,Glinda,"Also can you paste the code here, I'd rather not retype most of it the images are helpful."
1663,2017-12-07T22:44:38.000202,Tangela,"1. When encounter a string too long I want inform the user that string is too long for store it on db, 2. The user cannot store on column emails invalid characters like /, *,&amp;, %, etc."
1663,2017-12-07T22:54:00.000011,Glinda,Are you using python &lt; 2.7
1663,2017-12-07T22:56:21.000131,Tangela,I'm using 2.7
1663,2017-12-07T22:56:23.000137,Glinda,Okay
1663,2017-12-07T22:56:39.000188,Glinda,So I split your system into three parts.
1663,2017-12-07T23:00:07.000019,Glinda,"So now you have a single location where you might have an exception `db_cursor.execute('INSERT INTO {table_name}s({table_name}) VALUES {row}'.format(table_name=table_name, row=row))`"
1663,2017-12-07T23:02:37.000047,Tangela,Thank you very much <@Glinda> I was using try..except in everywhere but with your code was reduced to 3 at least
1663,2017-12-07T23:03:00.000116,Glinda,"You know, I don't think you need the `cursor.close()`"
1663,2017-12-07T23:03:50.000175,Glinda,"Couple of things: 1. Don't use user=root, pw = '' set your password to something if you must use root."
1663,2017-12-07T23:04:04.000046,Glinda,2. Try to define functions and make them reusable
1663,2017-12-07T23:04:29.000152,Glinda,Make your functions do as limited as possible
1663,2017-12-07T23:04:39.000159,Glinda,"The more they do, the harder it is to debug."
1663,2017-12-07T23:07:00.000037,Glinda,"A bunch more things I can suggest. But primarily, try and use python 3, and try and use a ORM like sqlalchemy."
1663,2017-12-07T23:07:30.000093,Glinda,"If you're just getting into python, it's better to start off with python 3."
1663,2017-12-07T23:08:41.000109,Glinda,"Anyways, feel free to ask any more questions, or more help. I'll be around here for a little while longer tonight."
1663,2017-12-07T23:09:49.000180,Tangela,"I see, from now on I will write more generic functions, I usually don't do that, later I got lost in the errors, py2.7 should be discontinued so maybe better try the most actual, there huge differences between it?"
1663,2017-12-07T23:32:41.000158,Glinda,Probably the biggest thing you'll notice is in python3 print is a function `print('string')`
1664,2017-12-08T01:37:18.000058,Blaine,"hi guys. a ver beginner question. considering this piece of code, that should sort an array of strings by their length ```def sort_by_length(arr):
    
    return sorted((a for a in arr), key=(len(a) for a in arr))```the 3.6 compiler tells me : `Traceback:
   in &lt;module&gt;
   in sort_by_length
TypeError: 'generator' object is not callable`. can someone be so kind to tell me whats going on, without to much solution spoilers :slightly_smiling_face: good morning EU and thanks in advance"
1664,2017-12-08T01:45:08.000212,Gisele,The `key` should be a function.  <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#key-functions> might help you.
1664,2017-12-08T01:52:03.000217,Blaine,"ok, but len is a build_in? i will read and contemplate."
1664,2017-12-08T02:14:32.000246,Blaine,"thank you <@Gisele> i've learned a lot on this. Solution is very compact ```def length(word):
    return len(word)

def sort_by_length(arr):
    return sorted(arr, key=length)```"
1664,2017-12-08T02:15:35.000196,Blaine,even shorter with this
1664,2017-12-08T02:15:41.000100,Blaine,"```def sort_by_length(arr):
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: len(x))
    
````"
1664,2017-12-08T02:15:54.000037,Gisele,"yes, len() is built in."
1664,2017-12-08T02:17:53.000214,Gisele,"this may be a spoiler, but

```def sort_by_length(arr):
    return sorted(arr, key=len)```

is shoter a bit."
1664,2017-12-08T02:21:59.000101,Blaine,"argh, i see, even shorter and also more intuitve. sometimes i think way to complicated"
1664,2017-12-08T02:22:14.000001,Blaine,thanks for your attention. may the code be with you :slightly_smiling_face:

1667,2017-12-08T09:22:40.000087,Jacki,"Hi guys. I am working with Celery, and it’s pretty cool. However, I would need a way to communicate with my application and I was thinking of nameko due to the wide range of communication protocols."
1667,2017-12-08T09:22:57.000052,Jacki,"I am still in the learning mode, so I am not sure if it is a good idea or not"
1667,2017-12-08T09:23:45.000520,Jacki,how do you usually provide your application with a communication layer
1667,2017-12-08T09:23:57.000617,Jacki,that can be rpc or pub/sub?
1667,2017-12-08T09:30:43.000263,Ciera,From what I know most of the times people try to use redis to store celery result
1667,2017-12-08T09:33:34.000628,Patty,"Or rabbitmq, those are probably the 2 big backends"
1667,2017-12-08T09:36:50.000079,Jacki,"oh yes, if you need to store results  you can use a few backends service. However, my questions is about the integration of the two project."
1667,2017-12-08T09:37:23.000321,Jacki,Let say that the main business logic of the workers is made with celery.
1667,2017-12-08T09:37:37.000368,Jacki,but I need to expose a public api
1667,2017-12-08T09:37:50.000030,Jacki,and I don’t want to use flask or some other REST api
1667,2017-12-08T09:38:04.000437,Jacki,"oh well, I would like to use something different than that"
1667,2017-12-08T09:38:17.000166,Jacki,something more message oriented.
1667,2017-12-08T09:38:43.000363,Jacki,I am not sure if combine together the functionalities of nameko and the logic of celery is a good catch or a bad idea
1667,2017-12-08T09:47:00.000708,Ciera,you want to expose an API over the network other than HTTP ?
1667,2017-12-08T09:48:45.000078,Ciera,nameko seems to be over http or AMQP
1667,2017-12-08T09:51:14.000104,Jacki,yes. I am trying to integrate it with AMQP

I tried convert the xml stream to json stream using xmltojson module .. after that I got the json steam ... But when I try to iterate over the json items I am getting error saying like.. attribute Error. 'str' object has no attribute 'items' ... I tried in Google but luck .. pls help me if u know the way to to
1667,2017-12-08T10:16:05.000414,Wade,<@Alexa> you are probably missing a conversion from json string to dict
1667,2017-12-08T10:16:22.000047,Wade,json.loads(your_str)
1667,2017-12-08T10:16:40.000192,Alexa,I have that in my code ... 
1667,2017-12-08T10:19:37.000520,Alexa,A = json.loads(json.dump(xmltodict.parse(xmlstream))) this my conversation code
1667,2017-12-08T10:20:02.000364,Alexa,After this I am trying to iterate using for loop 
1667,2017-12-08T10:22:36.000672,Wade,"<@Jacki> i don't know if i understood your question. Are you worried about using nameko and celery in your service, because both are over AMQP protocol?"
1667,2017-12-08T10:23:29.000247,Meg,<@Alexa> why are you converting to json when you alreayd have xml to dict conversion?
1667,2017-12-08T10:24:03.000326,Wade,"<@Alexa> could you post the code here as pyhon snippet? And yeah, loads after dumps is nosense."
1667,2017-12-08T10:24:25.000602,Alexa,<@Meg>  i am not able extract data from dict.. also  
1667,2017-12-08T10:24:25.000612,Meg,"if I read your code right, you’re converting xml to a dict, then to json string, then load that string it as a dict"
1667,2017-12-08T10:25:26.000573,Meg,what do you get when you do `type(xmltodict.parse(stream))`?
1667,2017-12-08T10:25:46.000109,Alexa,<@Meg> let me check
1667,2017-12-08T10:27:01.000308,Wade,that should be a dict
1667,2017-12-08T10:27:07.000192,Wade,<https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict>
1667,2017-12-08T10:28:37.000229,Alexa,<@Meg>  i am getting OrderedDict ([(....
1667,2017-12-08T10:28:54.000203,Meg,"ok, that’s a dict there"
1667,2017-12-08T10:29:03.000264,Meg,so how are you accessing the keys?
1667,2017-12-08T10:29:11.000424,Alexa,<@Wade>  any way to achieve this 
1667,2017-12-08T10:29:11.000757,Wade,<@Alexa> btw beware: json.dump and json.dumps are quite different methods
1667,2017-12-08T10:29:27.000233,Meg,"one relies on a file, and the other relies on a string"
1667,2017-12-08T10:29:53.000103,Meg,<@Alexa> use this for code formatting

1667,2017-12-08T10:31:42.000307,Meg,"because what’s appearing here is you’re doing the wrong thing with loading the data into a dict, and reading from the dict"
1667,2017-12-08T10:39:19.000146,Alexa,'for i in A.items():'
1667,2017-12-08T10:41:39.000227,Meg,and then?

1667,2017-12-08T10:42:32.000402,Meg,on the left side of the 1 key
1667,2017-12-08T10:42:37.000207,Meg,usually
1667,2017-12-08T10:42:40.000225,Meg,:smile:
1667,2017-12-08T10:43:18.000736,Meg,"ok, there are a number of problems here"
1667,2017-12-08T10:43:35.000251,Meg,"first, you have to use `items()` for `A`, and not inside it"
1667,2017-12-08T10:44:10.000419,Alexa,it was type mistake items only there..
1667,2017-12-08T10:45:07.000592,Meg,"eg 

```for i in A.keys():
    for k, v in i.items():
        print(k, v)
```"
1667,2017-12-08T10:45:28.000253,Meg,because you need to specify _what_ you’re trying to get from the dict
1667,2017-12-08T10:45:37.000459,Alexa,ok
1667,2017-12-08T10:45:41.000016,Alexa,lmc
1667,2017-12-08T10:45:43.000140,Meg,because its not an iterable by default
1667,2017-12-08T10:47:04.000508,Wade,"this will fail if one of your ""outer"" dict values are not dict themselves"
1667,2017-12-08T10:47:56.000329,Wade,uh wait
1667,2017-12-08T10:47:58.000010,Alexa,<@Wade> <@Meg> not i am getting above error
1667,2017-12-08T10:48:44.000236,Meg,that doesn’t make any sense at all
1667,2017-12-08T10:48:57.000493,Meg,are you using `A = xmltodict(stream)`?
1667,2017-12-08T10:49:46.000224,Wade,"in your snippet ""i"" is one of the keys of a dict"
1667,2017-12-08T10:51:27.000313,Wade,"and it's not possible it's a dict, because dicts are not hashable by default (probably OrderDicts are, but idk)"
1667,2017-12-08T10:54:20.000523,Wade,(and dict keys needs to be hashable...ofc)
1667,2017-12-08T10:54:59.000132,Jacki,"<@Wade> yes, I was wondering if it is a good solution in terms of performance and design. What I would like to have is an agnostic adapter for the APIs side of the application. Moreover, I’vent found that much about nameko and AMQP. Do you have any good example how to use it with Redis or Rabbit? Thanks a lot "
1667,2017-12-08T10:56:50.000146,Jacki,<@Tangela> could you show what kind of data your CSV have? 
1667,2017-12-08T10:57:30.000780,Alexa,<@Wade>  got it but it is not the key.. in dict let me ping the full code then u guys will get the clear idea ..
1667,2017-12-08T11:02:20.000173,Wade,"<@Tangela> other than the error you are getting (probably because that 'row' is invalid) , there is another kind of error (a LOT worst). You are exposing your system to be SQLInjected. If someone puts in that CSV a malicious snippet of SQL code, you run it in your database :slightly_smiling_face: look at psycopg2 docs and about SQLInjection generally <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html>"
1667,2017-12-08T11:03:36.000212,Tangela,Thanks <@Wade>! going to check it
1667,2017-12-08T11:05:10.000316,Wade,"<@Jacki> no, i'm sorry. I've not used celery or nameko. I only heard of them and look'd at their API some time ago"
1667,2017-12-08T11:07:28.000289,Meg,"I use celery alot, but not with nameko"
1667,2017-12-08T11:07:53.000157,Meg,"celery tasks are integrated with django apps, so I call them through regular django HTTP API calls"
1668,2017-12-08T09:57:22.000500,Alexa,Hi .. how to iterate over json stream.. to prient both key and value for all the items in the json steam.. pls help me on this 
1668,2017-12-08T10:09:23.000248,Alexa,Here is the full info ... 
1669,2017-12-08T11:19:13.000032,Season,"Hey slackers,  I started work for a new company 6 weeks ago, that is in desperate need of automation across the board..  I have been implementing python and bash scripts here and there to prove concepts and add some immediate value.  I want to step this up a notch and implement some type of integration platform that I can use to consume and push to rest APIs.   This is what I have been doing with python, bash and cron, but I’d like some sort of platform versus a bunch of scripts and cron.  I was looking at <https://zato.io/> and wondered what you all thought about it and if there are others I should check out as well."
1670,2017-12-08T11:41:30.000107,Patty,"That won’t prevent SQL injection, you’re putting the values directly into the query without sanitizing them"
1670,2017-12-08T11:42:05.000366,Patty,<http://bobby-tables.com/python>
1670,2017-12-08T11:42:34.000422,Patty,though it depends on which database module you are using
1670,2017-12-08T11:44:38.000082,Patty,"Also, a small thing, but it’s a lot easier to share code/output on here with snippets or code formatting with backticks instead of screenshots"
1670,2017-12-08T11:52:55.000781,Wade,"idk MySQLdb syntax, so you should check the API yourself. Consider using psycopg2, which support almost all SQL drivers <http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html>"
1670,2017-12-08T11:53:09.000380,Wade,in the usage there is also the example to avoid SQLInjection
1670,2017-12-08T11:59:06.000002,Patty,`psycopg2` supports other dialects?
1670,2017-12-08T11:59:58.000634,Keneth,you sure psycopg2 supports mysql?? I can't find anything about it mentioned in their documentation or anywhere else...
1670,2017-12-08T12:00:41.000212,Patty,I’m 99% sure `psycopg2` is specifically postgres
1670,2017-12-08T12:01:14.000089,Keneth,"for mysql he should be using MysqlDb, which also supports DB API2"
1670,2017-12-08T12:01:33.000285,Keneth,"me too, I got really surprised when I read such an statement"
1670,2017-12-08T12:25:33.000172,Wade,"<@Patty> <@Keneth> aww gawd, i'm so dumb. Yeah it's postgresql specific :sweat:"
1671,2017-12-08T12:14:46.000273,Tangela,"So, maybe should be better using a ORM like SQLAlchemy?"
1671,2017-12-08T12:22:38.000089,Glinda,"Realistically you should be using some type of framework that makes it so you don't have to write out the sql statements. I like sqlalchemy, but my experience level is like maybe a total of 50 hours. Some people here can provide you good alternatives."
1671,2017-12-08T12:26:31.000074,Wade,#sorry
1671,2017-12-08T12:26:59.000238,Tangela,"I used SQLAlchemy some years ago, was my first touch with a ORM, I guess will not be problematic try to implment,  anyway better that use pure sql statements. Thanks <@Wade>  <@Patty> <@Keneth> <@Glinda>"
1671,2017-12-08T12:28:09.000428,Keneth,"<@Tangela> if you are adventurous enough, give a try to peewee. A simpler and smaller ORM, but yet powerful enough. I've been using it with Flask and I love it."
1671,2017-12-08T12:29:05.000032,Keneth,"it has extensions for some of the most used databases, and it's quite awesome. The author, owner and maintainer helps with doubts on Stackoverflow quite quickly."
1671,2017-12-08T12:30:06.000177,Keneth,"anyway, there's no problem using SQL sentences, if you need them. But the DBApi2 interface supports parameters, which sanitizes the input for you for the values, so things like SQLInjection are less prone."
1671,2017-12-08T12:46:02.000526,Wade,<@Keneth> +1 for peewee. I tried it and was so smooth and easy
1672,2017-12-08T12:45:41.000101,Tennie,"Hi ... I am new to django and I keep running to migration problems like `django.db.utils.DatabaseError: ORA-00904: ""CORE_COMMAND"".""HIGH_RISK_JUSTIFICATION"": invalid identifier`.  Is there a trick in trouble shooting these sort of issues?"
1672,2017-12-08T12:46:05.000035,Meg,is this oracle?
1672,2017-12-08T12:46:18.000331,Tennie,yes
1672,2017-12-08T12:46:29.000007,Meg,what happens when you google examples of that error
1672,2017-12-08T12:47:09.000151,Meg,"not sure how oracle handles it, but invalid identifier seems to me its a bad type or null value when there’s something expected"
1672,2017-12-08T12:48:34.000616,Tennie,oh its pretty clear that the column high_risk_justifitication does not exist in the core_command table.  But the the django core/model.py references that field.
1672,2017-12-08T12:48:49.000392,Meg,did you make a migration?
1672,2017-12-08T12:48:52.000419,Meg,"a new one, that is"
1672,2017-12-08T12:49:04.000407,Tennie,and I have done the makemigrations and migrate
1672,2017-12-08T12:50:03.000401,Patty,is the first in the migrations?
1672,2017-12-08T12:50:19.000341,Meg,about the only thing I can think of is there’s some sort of migration out of order.
1672,2017-12-08T12:50:40.000267,Patty,or one didn’t generate correctly and the SQL may show the field wasnt being created
1672,2017-12-08T12:51:13.000477,Meg,"is this a new column name, or is it being re-used from a previously deleted/renamed column?"
1672,2017-12-08T12:54:43.000474,Tennie,There is a migration file that adds so I'd say it s new column
1672,2017-12-08T12:55:33.000327,Meg,do you set a default value for the field?
1672,2017-12-08T12:55:34.000152,Tennie,would zapping the pyc files help at all or be a disaster
1672,2017-12-08T12:55:47.000070,Tennie,I'll check for a default value
1672,2017-12-08T12:56:24.000672,Tennie,nope no default value
1672,2017-12-08T12:56:54.000158,Meg,"ok, if the field is not nullable, that’s a bad thing"
1672,2017-12-08T12:57:18.000079,Meg,"because if you’re changing a db table by adding in a not null field,you need to specify _some_ value to be inserted"
1672,2017-12-08T12:57:23.000650,Tennie,"`    high_risk_justification = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)`"
1672,2017-12-08T12:57:51.000329,Tennie,so I need to add a default?
1672,2017-12-08T12:58:16.000260,Tennie,looks like it is nullable ...
1672,2017-12-08T12:58:23.000292,Meg,what I’d do is remove `null = True`
1672,2017-12-08T12:58:32.000157,Meg,<https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tips/2016/07/25/django-tip-8-blank-or-null.html>
1672,2017-12-08T12:58:51.000699,Meg,"&gt;Now, where most developers get it wrong: Defining null=True for string-based fields such as CharField and TextField. Avoid doing that. Otherwise, you will end up having two possible values for “no data”, that is: None and an empty string. Having two possible values for “no data” is redundant. The Django convention is to use the empty string, not NULL."
1672,2017-12-08T12:59:47.000199,Tennie,would that fix my oracle ORA-00904 issue or is that just a best practice suggestion
1672,2017-12-08T12:59:54.000195,Meg,best practice
1672,2017-12-08T13:00:13.000140,Meg,because I really don’t have a clue why that migration error is happening
1672,2017-12-08T13:00:36.000464,Meg,if you run `manage.py migrate --list` do you have any unapplied migrations other than that one
1672,2017-12-08T13:00:46.000013,Tennie,cool thanks I'll try that
1673,2017-12-08T14:13:31.000445,Tennie,turned out that my django db user does not have privs to drop the tables before running my tests
1673,2017-12-08T14:14:04.000018,Tennie,so I had to log in via sqlplus as more priv'ed user and drop the tables
1673,2017-12-08T14:18:16.000632,Meg,interesting.  too bad the migration errror didn’t give more detail about that…
1673,2017-12-08T14:18:21.000050,Meg,nice find though
1674,2017-12-08T14:46:33.000303,Lory,"after an `os.fork()`, from a a child process, how do I pick up from the parent process when the child calls `os._exit(n)`? I don't want my parent to wait on the child because I need to fork a few times, I just want to be able to poll for when all child processes have completed and then continue execution from there"
1674,2017-12-08T14:50:01.000094,Meg,is there any way you can refactor from fork to use suprocess instead?
1674,2017-12-08T14:51:06.000532,Lory,That's the eventual goal but I'm trying to understand the root basics of forks and inter process communication before I use subprocess to hide the details
1674,2017-12-08T14:53:00.000149,Lory,"That and I tried it with subprocess first when I initially wrote the code but failed and ended up running everything in serial instead because it was simpler and faster to develop, but now I have time to go back and learn more about it so I'm starting at the very bottom"
1674,2017-12-08T14:53:30.000011,Lory,It's easier to learn when I can see the actual forks and exits and everything happening within the code itself
1675,2017-12-08T17:38:45.000460,Aliza,"Hey, is anyone keen to briefly discuss a database design 2-3 tables with me ?"
1676,2017-12-08T21:14:17.000121,Bette,Hi guys one of my friend told to use a IDE that will show code in left and it's output in right while typing 
1676,2017-12-08T21:15:00.000030,Bette,So that my code understanding will be improved like that he told can anyone name such IDE for python ?
1676,2017-12-08T21:18:07.000084,Corrinne,"It doesn't quite work like that in Python. You write a script, execute the code and you can display output using the print function, either in your terminal or an IDE. It doesn't just output on the fly.

1676,2017-12-08T21:23:57.000060,Bette,Apart from programming skills how did you improved your logical skills ?
1676,2017-12-08T21:24:02.000085,Bette,Any tips

1676,2017-12-08T21:42:20.000077,Nicole,But I'd probably not recommend a new student rush out and sign up for a course in it.
1676,2017-12-08T22:49:20.000062,Bette,Symbolic logic ?

1678,2017-12-09T05:37:49.000068,Tangela,"When I used other approach previously, worked perfectly..."
1678,2017-12-09T05:41:49.000016,Louis,<@Tangela>: You should never do it that way; it's actually usually simpler to do it without a `.format()`.
1678,2017-12-09T05:42:26.000070,Louis,"And it's not just about SQL injection attacks; you have to quote the values correctly just for the query to work correctly at all, in the first place, so you don't have problems like the above."
1678,2017-12-09T05:53:56.000049,Tangela,"<@Louis> I know that's dangerous, I am just using this way because is I'm trying to find the error point so I did simple just to debug easier. Do you mean quote the {row} value? Well,  I tried put into double quotes, what print something like VALUES(""[\'<http://00author.com|00author.com>\']"")\' However I get the same error about syntax"
1678,2017-12-09T05:54:24.000027,Louis,"<@Tangela>: Well, it's not just dangerous; it often just won't work at all. :)"
1678,2017-12-09T05:54:35.000076,Louis,Python string escaping just is not the same as DB escaping.
1678,2017-12-09T05:54:45.000050,Louis,"If it worked before, it only worked by accident."
1678,2017-12-09T05:55:07.000049,Louis,"What's the actual data you have, and the query you want?"
1678,2017-12-09T05:57:04.000051,Tangela,"I have a list of domain and url's, I want insert into database, There are so many entries, so I using a loop."
1678,2017-12-09T05:57:52.000025,Louis,"You can do it in a single `executemany()`, without a loop."
1678,2017-12-09T05:58:02.000033,Louis,What are the rows?
1678,2017-12-09T05:58:56.000023,Tangela,row in this case are  each line of file

1678,2017-12-09T07:02:56.000064,Louis,It shouldn't; your previous examples showed it being parsed as expected.
1678,2017-12-09T07:05:42.000071,Tangela,Not in really
1678,2017-12-09T07:05:54.000082,Tangela,could be txt

1678,2017-12-09T12:48:28.000001,Glinda,Why are you trying to make a method private?
1678,2017-12-09T12:49:15.000009,Micheline,"The method is only helpful for that class and not any other classes, so I think it should be private."

1678,2017-12-09T12:53:01.000023,Micheline,But can you do the patching while keeping it private?
1678,2017-12-09T12:53:34.000017,Lachelle,"not sure about the patching, but if you do prefer to mark something as an implementation detail and not relevant to anybody else, prefixing with a _ is the pythonic way of doing that"
1678,2017-12-09T12:54:10.000058,Glinda,"it could be that by marking it private, it's preventing the patching from not working, because you're trying to access a private method."
1678,2017-12-09T12:54:25.000022,Glinda,I'm not really sure
1678,2017-12-09T12:54:40.000112,Lachelle,double underscore prefixes should generally be avoided
1678,2017-12-09T12:54:51.000074,Nicole,agreed

1687,2017-12-11T10:59:42.000876,Jacki,consumed
1687,2017-12-11T11:00:19.000792,Jacki,and let say that serviceB is my Celery application in charge of dealing with tasks
1687,2017-12-11T11:00:42.000142,Jacki,how I can request to serviceB to run tasks?
1687,2017-12-11T11:01:09.000639,Jacki,"so, in other words,"
1687,2017-12-11T11:01:25.000518,Jacki,how do you expose the APIs of the serviceB
1687,2017-12-11T11:01:26.000062,Jacki,?
1687,2017-12-11T11:01:59.000610,Jacki,"<@Patty>, yes i am looking to send tasks"
1687,2017-12-11T11:02:06.000950,Meg,"makes sense.

what I do is each django app’s celery tasks are integrated with the exposed api for that app"
1687,2017-12-11T11:02:23.000357,Meg,where some POST requests explicitly trigger one or many tasks
1687,2017-12-11T11:02:52.000633,Jacki,"ok, but what if I do not have django but just a stand alone backend application"
1687,2017-12-11T11:03:01.000574,Jacki,that just does one job
1687,2017-12-11T11:03:06.000632,Meg,just follow the regular celery documentation
1687,2017-12-11T11:03:09.000189,Meg,should be the same
1687,2017-12-11T11:03:30.000098,Meg,that would handle executing tasks
1687,2017-12-11T11:03:38.000047,Jacki,"oh well, is what I am doing, but still something it’s not that clear"
1687,2017-12-11T11:03:46.000196,Meg,what do you mean?
1687,2017-12-11T11:03:55.000399,Jacki,"moreover, I have to put that application into a docker container, so"
1687,2017-12-11T11:04:07.000622,Jacki,I need to communicate with that service
1687,2017-12-11T11:04:59.000400,Meg,"uhm, I think you’re not entirely understanding of what celery is"
1687,2017-12-11T11:05:23.000806,Jacki,"i am pretty new to Celery, but this is my structure"
1687,2017-12-11T11:05:27.000328,Jacki,‘’’json
1687,2017-12-11T11:05:29.000720,Jacki,"docker-cluster-with-celery-and-rabbitmq
  -- test_celery
    -- __init__.py
    -- celery.py
    -- tasks.py
    -- run_tasks.py
  -- docker-compose.yml
  -- dockerfile
  -- requirements.txt"
1687,2017-12-11T11:05:57.000258,Jacki,"so, I am able to run tasks, such as sending emails"
1687,2017-12-11T11:06:23.000271,Jacki,"but, my question is, do I need to integrate Celery with django or I can use it"
1687,2017-12-11T11:06:35.000122,Jacki,in a stand alone application adding a layer of communication
1687,2017-12-11T11:06:46.000467,Jacki,"like, RPC or REST or whatever"
1687,2017-12-11T11:07:45.000108,Jacki,and use it just as a distributed task Q
1687,2017-12-11T11:07:52.000136,Meg,"hmm, ok.  So to be clear, celery consists of three parts:
worker, broker and task"
1687,2017-12-11T11:08:01.000356,Meg,you’ve already written up the tasks
1687,2017-12-11T11:08:22.000051,Meg,and you apparently already use rabbit to handle the task queueing
1687,2017-12-11T11:08:41.000192,Myong,Can anyone recommend a library for grabbing an address from coordinates?
1687,2017-12-11T11:08:45.000562,Meg,"the worer is completely de-coupled from everything, and just listens to messages from the broker"
1687,2017-12-11T11:08:53.000664,Meg,geocoding?
1687,2017-12-11T11:09:19.000548,Meg,"so you have that cluster and communication, <@Jacki>"
1687,2017-12-11T11:09:33.000548,Meg,"thing is, tasks are highly specific, are they not?"
1687,2017-12-11T11:10:20.000373,Meg,"you can use OOP and task classes to create levels of inheritance, but in the end, a task is highly specific to the thing it is supposed to do"
1687,2017-12-11T11:10:34.000436,Jacki,true
1687,2017-12-11T11:10:51.000120,Jacki,"but still, if i have to send 100 email to 100 users"
1687,2017-12-11T11:11:05.000266,Jacki,I have to communicate the array of those 100 email addresses
1687,2017-12-11T11:11:09.000298,Meg,no
1687,2017-12-11T11:11:17.000385,Jacki,"oh,"
1687,2017-12-11T11:11:22.000090,Meg,"well, yeah.  but not exactly"
1687,2017-12-11T11:11:36.000663,Meg,you have the data from your backend service
1687,2017-12-11T11:11:43.000354,Meg,you post it to your rabbit broker
1687,2017-12-11T11:11:48.000165,Meg,and the workers pick it up
1687,2017-12-11T11:12:29.000556,Patty,<@Jacki> do you _want_ to handle sending emails to users? that can be a mess and end up with your email server running into all kinds of problems when it starts getting blacklisted. if youre looking to move this up to production-level i’d integrate with an external mailing service
1687,2017-12-11T11:12:42.000043,Jacki,and I suppose it’s the same with Redis
1687,2017-12-11T11:13:28.000321,Jacki,"<@Patty>, yes I already have an external mailing service where all the stuff"
1687,2017-12-11T11:13:50.000006,Jacki,and basically yes I have to send email mgs as result of some actions
1687,2017-12-11T11:14:08.000395,Meg,"so, long story short, you can indeed make a service layer of sorts to handle the task calling and execution"
1687,2017-12-11T11:14:27.000539,Meg,"question is, does having this explicit layer make sense in your overall application and project structure?"
1687,2017-12-11T11:14:52.000810,Jacki,"well, yes because I can only send a payload to a serviceA"
1687,2017-12-11T11:15:08.000538,Jacki,and I don’t have to take care of broker
1687,2017-12-11T11:15:13.000714,Jacki,or other technology stack
1687,2017-12-11T11:15:18.000763,Meg,uhm you _do_
1687,2017-12-11T11:15:22.000829,Jacki,serviceA will be in charge of
1687,2017-12-11T11:15:29.000176,Meg,because you need that for celery
1687,2017-12-11T11:15:32.000306,Jacki,do whatever he wants to do
1687,2017-12-11T11:15:39.000259,Meg,or for any kind of asynchronous task queue
1687,2017-12-11T11:15:47.000575,Jacki,"oh yes, serviceA has celery and use Redis in my example"
1687,2017-12-11T11:16:02.000614,Jacki,and he has a public endpoint
1687,2017-12-11T11:16:16.000066,Jacki,just to receive the work to perform
1687,2017-12-11T11:16:43.000070,Jacki,is that make sense?
1687,2017-12-11T11:17:46.000042,Meg,"What I get from you is Service A is a backend service, and you need it to pass off async tasks to celery workers."
1687,2017-12-11T11:18:40.000078,Jacki,"@http(‘POST’, ‘/api/email_dispatcher’)
          task = tasks.send_email.delay(payload_to_send,url_to_call)"
1687,2017-12-11T11:18:41.000819,Glinda,<@Ciera> question about slack api. I have two application credentials 1. real slack  2. test slack. I got my application to work using the test slack and now i want to go back and get the `xoxb-` token for real slack. Problem is when I try and use the real slack token it's apparently connected only to the test slack.
1687,2017-12-11T11:18:45.000068,Jacki,something like that
1687,2017-12-11T11:18:49.000470,Meg,"why not import the task module in Service A and execute it there via 

```task = SomeTask()
task.apply_async(args = [arg1, arg2], queue = 'specific_queue')
```"
1687,2017-12-11T11:19:39.000456,Myong,Is there a universal way to query an API to ask for entries where keys dont exist?
1687,2017-12-11T11:19:44.000436,Jacki,yes is what I did
1687,2017-12-11T11:20:03.000354,Jacki,"but,"
1687,2017-12-11T11:20:08.000279,Jacki,in my local env
1687,2017-12-11T11:20:19.000293,Jacki,I have one console with the celery worker runs
1687,2017-12-11T11:20:38.000123,Jacki,and another one where I run the serviceA
1687,2017-12-11T11:20:46.000308,Jacki,in order to expose the APIs
1687,2017-12-11T11:20:54.000069,Patty,"<@Myong> no, this is something that would only be available if the API implemented it"
1687,2017-12-11T11:21:04.000140,Myong,figured as much
1687,2017-12-11T11:21:15.000167,Jacki,but I don’t know how to put those guys into docker containers and then into production
1687,2017-12-11T11:21:33.000015,Meg,I don’t think you should dockerize celery in prod
1687,2017-12-11T11:21:40.000226,Meg,"since the workers are running as daemons, anway"
1687,2017-12-11T11:21:44.000095,Meg,"at least, they should"
1687,2017-12-11T11:21:52.000112,Meg,"so, docker really doesn’t apply here, IMO"
1687,2017-12-11T11:21:57.000593,Ciera,<@Glinda> are you sure you haven't mixed up your tokens ? :smile: A token is link to a slack team
1687,2017-12-11T11:22:22.000770,Glinda,Pretty certain
1687,2017-12-11T11:22:26.000896,Jacki,uhmm
1687,2017-12-11T11:22:38.000929,Jacki,but from an architectural point of view
1687,2017-12-11T11:22:42.000966,Glinda,"I tried it a few times last night, and even reinstalled application"
1687,2017-12-11T11:22:55.000548,Meg,<@Jacki> <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/daemonizing.html>
1687,2017-12-11T11:23:02.000049,Glinda,I'm trying to use the RTM api and I'm wondering if it's a cache issue.
1687,2017-12-11T11:23:07.000259,Jacki,does it make sense to have a serviceA with a public APIs and Celery?
1687,2017-12-11T11:23:24.000272,Meg,"uhm, yes"
1687,2017-12-11T11:23:49.000134,Jacki,"oh ok, but I think you can put it into a container"
1687,2017-12-11T11:25:04.000420,Jacki,but
1687,2017-12-11T11:25:11.000471,Meg,"oh, for development certainly"
1687,2017-12-11T11:25:22.000244,Jacki,if I can have a serviceA with public API and Celery inside
1687,2017-12-11T11:25:23.000974,Meg,but production?
1687,2017-12-11T11:26:23.000876,Jacki,I should have to run the serviceA with python service.py and at the same time
1687,2017-12-11T11:26:27.000409,Jacki,the celery worker
1687,2017-12-11T11:26:31.000629,Jacki,am I right?
1687,2017-12-11T11:26:38.000338,Meg,correct
1687,2017-12-11T11:27:10.000968,Jacki,"so, in the end, Can Celery be used as a standalone distributed task management?"
1687,2017-12-11T11:27:44.000522,Jacki,@dd2 thanks a lot for helping me.
1687,2017-12-11T11:28:20.000679,Jacki,@dd2 <https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/dockerize-a-flask-celery-and-redis-application-with-docker-compose>
1687,2017-12-11T11:28:50.000835,Meg,"yeah, I’ve seen that before, and have talked with Ken Cochrane at Docker about this very thing"
1687,2017-12-11T11:29:09.000005,Meg,"FWIW, I like that setup for development"
1687,2017-12-11T11:29:12.000110,Meg,"production, no"
1687,2017-12-11T11:29:28.000520,Jacki,what do you suggest for production?
1687,2017-12-11T11:29:46.000269,Meg,"so, I I have a 10 servers on AWS"
1687,2017-12-11T11:30:03.000122,Meg,and 12 different queues
1687,2017-12-11T11:30:45.000581,Meg,"workers on celery servers are daemonized, where workers are listening to one or more queues, depending on the task resource requirements, run time, etc"
1687,2017-12-11T11:31:10.000618,Meg,"for example, tasks that run in five seconds require fewer resources than tasks with 6 hours run time"
1687,2017-12-11T11:31:54.000650,Meg,then my app API pushes new tasks into the rabbit broker queues
1687,2017-12-11T11:31:57.000134,Jacki,and what about scalability
1687,2017-12-11T11:32:27.000219,Meg,"no problem.  Spin up 1 or 10 new servers, map them to the queues required and its hands off after that"
1687,2017-12-11T11:33:08.000277,Meg,"then when it comes time to spin down, shut down the worker processes and wait for them to finish executing the currently executing tasks"
1687,2017-12-11T11:33:24.000009,Jacki,"ok, makes sense."
1687,2017-12-11T11:33:36.000381,Meg,"once that’s done, the workers will stop listening to the queue, and the broker doesn’t care"
1687,2017-12-11T11:34:15.000113,Jacki,problably I am using a cannon to shot a fly
1687,2017-12-11T11:34:34.000645,Meg,"if all you’re doing is sending out emails with this, then yeah"
1687,2017-12-11T11:34:40.000046,Meg,much better ways to handle that
1687,2017-12-11T11:35:00.000117,Jacki,like coding a queue
1687,2017-12-11T11:35:08.000454,Jacki,and send email using aiohttp
1687,2017-12-11T11:35:24.000877,Meg,"no, use an external mailing service"
1687,2017-12-11T11:35:42.000206,Meg,because you’re running the risk of being blacklisted
1687,2017-12-11T11:35:47.000330,Jacki,i can’t really use an external service for policy
1687,2017-12-11T11:35:58.000057,Jacki,so no mailchimp or stuff like that
1687,2017-12-11T11:36:13.000557,Jacki,and I can assume that I won’t be backlisted
1687,2017-12-11T11:36:53.000799,Meg,something like this might make more sense for you
1687,2017-12-11T11:36:54.000256,Meg,<https://github.com/nvie/rq>
1687,2017-12-11T11:38:08.000008,Jacki,I’ll have a look at
1687,2017-12-11T11:38:10.000294,Jacki,thanks
1687,2017-12-11T11:38:21.000095,Meg,good luck :smile:
1687,2017-12-11T11:38:43.000749,Jacki,"so, in a nutshell, when Celery is a good solution?"
1687,2017-12-11T11:41:58.000247,Jacki,a large collections of vms taks deployments?
1687,2017-12-11T11:42:29.000463,Jacki,loading the top 100 stories from a remote services?
1687,2017-12-11T11:43:02.000257,Meg,when you have repeatable tasks that you want to keep out of the http request-response loop
1687,2017-12-11T11:43:18.000192,Meg,with quality scale up/down capability
1687,2017-12-11T11:45:45.000826,Meg,"for example, I just finished indexing 10 million mirrored web pages in solr for search using celery.  took 3 days to do"
1687,2017-12-11T11:46:12.000920,Meg,"brought online some extra servers from AWS to handle the extra load, and shut them down when it was done"
1687,2017-12-11T11:46:26.000824,Jacki,great.
1687,2017-12-11T11:46:44.000138,Jacki,"cool, I know how I’ll spend the rest of the day"
1687,2017-12-11T11:46:53.000581,Jacki,thanks again
1687,2017-12-11T11:47:03.000378,Jacki,I’ll try to sort it out
1687,2017-12-11T11:47:36.000046,Jacki,but may I ask you why you don’t like the docker solution
1687,2017-12-11T11:47:44.000002,Jacki,for a production env
1687,2017-12-11T11:48:07.000061,Jacki,"i mean, docker is strong enough and reliable"
1687,2017-12-11T11:48:23.000423,Jacki,is it something related to celery itself ?
1687,2017-12-11T11:48:42.000386,Meg,just don’t see the need for it
1687,2017-12-11T11:48:54.000057,Meg,because celery workers are already daemonized
1687,2017-12-11T11:49:05.000395,Meg,"so, why go through the docker layer?"
1687,2017-12-11T11:49:45.000734,Jacki,to have a configuration ready to start in different env
1687,2017-12-11T11:50:43.000128,Jacki,"you do the conf once, you can repeat everywhere, even localy"
1687,2017-12-11T11:50:51.000556,Meg,"```pip install -r requirements.txt
cp celery-default /etc/default/celeryd
sudo service celeryd restart
```"
1687,2017-12-11T11:51:12.000152,Jacki,I’ll try your way
1687,2017-12-11T11:51:34.000147,Meg,that’s pretty much it for me.
1687,2017-12-11T11:52:07.000369,Jacki,ok
1687,2017-12-11T11:52:51.000446,Meg,"that said, I am going to be teaching myself docker this winter.  It has benefits I can use"
1687,2017-12-11T11:53:30.000023,Meg,but I just don’t see any distinct advantage to containerizing celery on dedicated servers that are wholly responsible for async workers
1687,2017-12-11T11:54:21.000042,Jacki,portability is one of the main advantages
1687,2017-12-11T11:54:49.000666,Jacki,your container is not  coupled to your server
1687,2017-12-11T11:54:59.000603,Glinda,Where should I ask questions about test cases for a project?
1687,2017-12-11T11:55:29.000063,Jacki,"but, yes, I see your point"
1687,2017-12-11T11:55:49.000497,Jacki,anyway I am trying to put my celery app into a container
1687,2017-12-11T11:56:01.000675,Jacki,and see what’s going on

1691,2017-12-11T12:19:52.000462,Ciera,environment variables
1691,2017-12-11T12:20:15.000809,Ciera,and second choice would be args to pass at startup for testing

1691,2017-12-11T12:23:41.000081,Beula,"I tend to favor Environment variables as well, primarily because in the case of a deployed environment it allows you to change them without a re-deploy. I usually have a settings file that can be loaded that refrences the envvars to keep it tidy and not leak envvars all over the code base"
1691,2017-12-11T12:29:47.000297,Ciera,yeah environment variable is usually the way to go and it's really easy to load them in a script

1691,2017-12-11T12:47:18.000447,Myong,Turns out bings API isn't ratelimited and allows upwards of 250k queries a year so that should do.
1691,2017-12-11T12:47:51.000183,Myong,so I guess it is rate limited at 250k queries a year but whatever
1692,2017-12-11T13:28:55.000216,Jacki,does anyone has ever used Celery with Redis sentinels?
1692,2017-12-11T13:29:11.000539,Jacki,it is driving me crazy …
1692,2017-12-11T13:34:11.000307,Enid,"Question: I have a server-side application that automates downloading a bunch of excel files, performs some ETL, and writes them to a SQL db. I have like 30 functions that contain each search (automated through selenium, and the site's HTML doesn't really lend itself to iterating through those searches in a single function). I currently have one master function that calls all 31 functions, but is there a more pythonic way to run all of these searches without calling every function in another function? It just looks amtuerish to me."
1692,2017-12-11T13:46:30.000075,Antionette,Are the functions just different in terms of the search arguments they're called with or are they actually different functions?
1692,2017-12-11T13:48:13.000605,Nicole,"Also, is this a blocking function or are you using some sort of task queue like Celery?"
1692,2017-12-11T14:03:51.000001,Enid,<@Antionette> They are different functions.
1692,2017-12-11T14:04:29.000384,Enid,<@Nicole> I'm not using a task queue.
1692,2017-12-11T14:11:33.000619,Glinda,Is there an easy way to wrap a `slackclient` rtm_socket in a flask app so I can host on `pythonanywhere`
1692,2017-12-11T14:21:44.000493,Nicole,"<@Enid> Running a lot of discrete tasks server-side sounds, at least on the surface, like a possible application for Celery ... especially if the tasks don't have a lot of dependencies.  It doesn't really sound like a question of ""pythonic"" or not."
1693,2017-12-11T14:16:18.000390,Ciera,Not that I know of but the you could host it on digital ocean 
1693,2017-12-11T14:16:28.000026,Arlene,I didnt know time objects would be such a big pain today haha. If I have the time in a string like `2017-12-11 11:21:29` is there a good way to convert string times like that into UTC times in python?
1693,2017-12-11T14:17:24.000710,Ciera,There is the arrow lib <@Suellen> showed you or `datetime.strptime`
1693,2017-12-11T14:17:29.000468,Suellen,do you know the timezone?
1693,2017-12-11T14:18:12.000278,Arlene,"I do, but it be nioce not to have to know it"
1693,2017-12-11T14:18:44.000491,Suellen,you can't convert time to UTC without knowing its original timezone
1693,2017-12-11T14:19:46.000261,Arlene,whatever whatever -0600 is
1693,2017-12-11T14:19:52.000545,Arlene,central USA i think
1693,2017-12-11T14:20:08.000001,Arlene,yea lets say its central
1693,2017-12-11T14:22:53.000295,Nicole,And Celery is but one (popular) approach.
1693,2017-12-11T14:27:23.000028,Arlene,I think i got it with this
1693,2017-12-11T14:27:34.000218,Arlene,"```
In [48]: x
Out[48]: '2017-12-11 11:21:29'

1693,2017-12-11T14:42:59.000387,Ciera,this didn't change the time. You just added the timezone info to be UTC
1694,2017-12-11T14:43:03.000517,Ciera,is that what you want ?
1694,2017-12-11T14:46:28.000205,Arlene,thats what i wanted

1695,2017-12-11T14:53:38.000368,Beula,"I'd probably just do multiple passes to make it simple myself, it also allows you to provide better validation reasons for why it may have failed."
1695,2017-12-11T14:56:21.000681,Beula,"It would be a little more flexible to, as you effectively can make a rules engine:

```

1696,2017-12-11T16:10:16.000206,Myong,[Is there any way for me to replicate a POST/GET request sent to a java server to generate a query that way I can simply use the `requests` module to do so? Or is this something I have to do with `BS4` or a similar library by entering the data to fill in each form field
1696,2017-12-11T16:14:19.000278,Myong,I have the source of the form data from the POST in the format `owner_name=&amp;asr_r_zipcode=&amp;radiusChoice=all&amp;fiLatDeg=` and so on. Would I have to pass these form fields to `requests` in the form of a dictionary/json?
1696,2017-12-11T16:28:50.000401,Antionette,I believe requests would just accept them in the url but not 100% sure on that
1696,2017-12-11T16:28:59.000070,Antionette,You could use this to parse to a dictionary (<https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/urllib.parse.html?highlight=url%20parse#urllib.parse.parse_qs>)

1696,2017-12-11T16:57:46.000217,Myong,Not sure if that's because they have to be actually clicked or what.
1696,2017-12-11T16:58:01.000037,Antionette,It might need to be `asr_r_struct_code[]`

1696,2017-12-11T17:06:34.000252,Antionette,"When you say it doesn't select any of the 15 options shown, what do you mean? because none of the params come up filled in for the get request to that page.  Do you mean when you post its not returning the correct/expected results?"

1696,2017-12-11T17:23:15.000576,Myong,I guess it might actually be grabbing the content
1696,2017-12-11T17:23:28.000255,Myong,Gotta find the function to pretty print it
1696,2017-12-11T17:24:51.000272,Myong,Yeah not sure at this point actually.
1696,2017-12-11T17:26:26.000320,Antionette,You could try writing the response to a file and then opening that local file in a browser to see if it matches what you'd be expecting
1696,2017-12-11T17:27:50.000405,Antionette,alternatively the title of the results page is `ASR Registration Search Results` whereas the title of the search page is `ASR Advanced Registration Search` so you might be able to do a quick check of that to see if the page is at least right even if its a bit harder to check if the results match what you'd expect
1696,2017-12-11T17:32:05.000283,Myong,"Yeah it's the search itself, not the results"
1696,2017-12-11T17:33:10.000382,Antionette,ah kk

1697,2017-12-11T18:11:19.000297,Ora,"hello,
So lets say we have to process a list and compare every list indice to the next indice like this:
if foo(list[n]) == bar(list[n+1): 
The way I implemented that in my script (ignoring what the foo and bar actually do) is something like this:"
1697,2017-12-11T18:12:02.000157,Ora,And i feel like it's really unpythonic and bad : &lt;
1697,2017-12-11T18:20:22.000170,Marilyn,maybe try using enumerate and compare backwards instead of forwards
1697,2017-12-11T18:21:57.000525,Glinda,"So you want to compare each value in list to the next one, but you're actually doing `foo(value_1)` to `bar(next_value)`"
1697,2017-12-11T18:22:43.000211,Ora,"no, a value needs to be compared only to the next value"
1697,2017-12-11T18:23:13.000190,Glinda,So what is `foo` and `bar` in your syntax?
1697,2017-12-11T18:24:53.000207,Ora,"doesn't matter i think really, i'm just asking if writing code this way is good, actually we could get rid of foo and bar and just compare the values. The code actually works, but i think it could be made more readable"
1697,2017-12-11T18:27:03.000309,Glinda,"```def compare(input):
    for first, second in zip(input, input[1:]):
        if first == second:
            print('hooray!')
        
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    input = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    input2 = [1,2,3,4,4,6]
    compare(input)
    compare(input2)```"
1697,2017-12-11T18:28:23.000267,Glinda,That shouldwork nicely.
1697,2017-12-11T18:28:44.000017,Ora,awww this is so nice !
1697,2017-12-11T18:28:48.000020,Ora,thanks : D
1697,2017-12-11T18:29:39.000019,Glinda,replacing `==` with `is` also works for integers and strings
1697,2017-12-11T18:30:20.000419,Ora,gotta remember that
1697,2017-12-11T18:30:26.000468,Ora,on a side note
1697,2017-12-11T18:32:19.000035,Ora,"is it normal for a begginer that slowly starts to write code that actually does sometging meaningful, to look at my code and think ""this is such a mess"", even if it works? Also, do you know a good place where i can show more experienced people my code for review? I know there is a code review subreddit but didn't see much traffic there."
1697,2017-12-11T18:36:36.000058,Glinda,"1. I can't answer this one, I learned python after c/c++ so even the simple things looked less messier. 2. You can probably show anywhere you want, but there's _sooo_ many things to improve on don't feel bad if you're writing ""bad"" code. Just keep improving."
1697,2017-12-11T18:37:59.000126,Ora,"trying to, thanks for the help : )"
1697,2017-12-11T18:40:36.000300,Glinda,To clarify 1. Python looked much cleaner than c++
1698,2017-12-12T02:30:07.000156,Sara,"Team,i need some help in running a python script which is on windows via ubuntu machine"
1698,2017-12-12T02:30:19.000128,Sara,i have created a paramiko session to that machine
1698,2017-12-12T02:31:01.000034,Sara,"and when i pass this command to exec command func of paramiko  command = 'cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\python.exe C:\pythonattempt\try.py"""
1698,2017-12-12T02:31:03.000166,Sara,its not working
1698,2017-12-12T02:31:09.000056,Sara,can some one guide me here
1698,2017-12-12T02:31:19.000106,Sara,i have ssh server running on that machine
1698,2017-12-12T04:22:33.000459,Marg,can you import another python script only if time is in range ?
1699,2017-12-12T05:31:10.000303,Hipolito,"Hi all.
I have little problem with performance may little function:
```
import itertools


def removNb(n):
    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))
    pairs = list(itertools.combinations(numbers, 2))
    total = sum(numbers)
    pairs = list(filter(lambda par: par[0] * par[1] == total - (par[0] + par[1]), pairs))
    result = pairs + list(map(lambda par: (par[1], par[0]), pairs))
    result.sort()
    return result
```
Any idea haw make this better. I'm only beginner in Python :slightly_smiling_face:"
1699,2017-12-12T05:33:26.000004,Ciera,Could you explain what is the end goal of the function ? :slightly_smiling_face:
1699,2017-12-12T05:34:55.000208,Hipolito,a sorry
1699,2017-12-12T05:38:25.000319,Hipolito,"He says that the product of a and b should be equal to the sum of all numbers in the sequence, excluding a and b.
Given a number n, could you tell me the numbers he excluded from the sequence?
The function takes the parameter: n (n always n &gt; 0) and returns an list of the form: `[(a, b), ...]`
It happens that there are several possible (a, b). The function returns an empty array if no possible numbers are found.
#Example:
```
removNb(26) should return [(15, 21), (21, 15)]
```"
1699,2017-12-12T05:41:32.000037,Hipolito,"As I said, I'm a beginner :slightly_smiling_face:"
1699,2017-12-12T05:52:45.000245,Ciera,"I would start with something like ```
for x in range(n/2):
  for y in range(n/2, n):
    if ....
```"
1699,2017-12-12T05:57:40.000294,Hipolito,but `n/2` not always is int
1699,2017-12-12T05:58:26.000100,Ciera,oh yeah my bad. you should cast it to an int. `int(n/2)`
1699,2017-12-12T06:01:44.000018,Hipolito,"but still it does not give the intended effect because now `a` is max 12 and as you can see an example, `a` is equal to 15 and in the next tuple 21"
1699,2017-12-12T06:02:01.000046,Hipolito,a is x
1699,2017-12-12T06:03:28.000340,Hipolito,and should check all possible pairs of numbers
1699,2017-12-12T06:03:30.000400,Ciera,ah yeah my bad. I wasn't sure a `/2` would work.
1699,2017-12-12T06:03:57.000078,Ciera,anyways you can do two loops in `range(n + 1)`. (forgot the +1 also :p)
1699,2017-12-12T06:04:01.000168,Ciera,that's quite fast
1699,2017-12-12T06:05:07.000246,Ciera,it's the `map/filter` that are longer I suppose
1699,2017-12-12T06:05:37.000412,Ciera,I'm going to go eat something. I can make a better snippet afterwards if needed :slightly_smiling_face:
1699,2017-12-12T06:09:03.000420,Hipolito,"unfortunately, I have tried this too and it is even slower"
1699,2017-12-12T06:09:35.000403,Hipolito,"```def removNb(n):
    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))
    total = sum(numbers)
    result = []
    for first in numbers:
        for second in numbers:
            if first == second:
                continue
            if first * second == total - (first + second):
                result.append((first, second))
    return result```"
1699,2017-12-12T06:10:15.000286,Hipolito,this work nice if we have numbers below 100
1699,2017-12-12T06:10:49.000250,Hipolito,and after I try this way:
1699,2017-12-12T06:10:53.000460,Hipolito,"```def removNb(n):
    numbers = list(range(1, n + 1))
    pairs = list(itertools.combinations(numbers, 2))
    total = sum(numbers)
    result = []
    for first, second in pairs:
        if first * second == total - (first + second):
            result.append((first, second))
            result.append((second, first))
    return result```"
1699,2017-12-12T06:11:09.000006,Hipolito,still to slow
1699,2017-12-12T06:13:02.000541,Hipolito,"Bon Appetit,
and I would be very grateful for your help."
1699,2017-12-12T06:16:52.000410,Hipolito,"I'm back to work now if you find something please send to me directly, thx :slightly_smiling_face:"
1699,2017-12-12T06:22:20.000297,Ciera,I'm not sure what are the limits of `n` are but I think once you reach higher number you need to be clever about it and skip ranges of number.
1699,2017-12-12T06:23:12.000165,Fabiola,"Problem has piqued my curiosity! Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, <@Ciera>. Have to think about the mathematics of the problem and find a shortcut so you don't need to compute so much"
1699,2017-12-12T06:27:13.000023,Fabiola,which for large `n` should cut out a lot of pairs
1700,2017-12-12T06:26:25.000492,Fabiola,"For instance, you don't need to check pairs where both numbers are greater than `sqrt(sum(range(n)))`"
1700,2017-12-12T06:29:46.000248,Ciera,"I win a big chunk of time by removing the `list` from  `list(itertools.combinations(numbers, 2))` as it's not usefull"
1700,2017-12-12T06:30:31.000270,Fabiola,"What's the complexity of the naive approach? `sum(range(n))` is `n(n-1)/2`, and then by comparing all pairs, you check `n(n-1)/2 * n(n-1)/2` pairs"
1700,2017-12-12T06:30:48.000180,Fabiola,So the complexity is essentially `O(n**4)`?
1700,2017-12-12T06:31:37.000144,Fabiola,`n**2*(n-1)**2/4` pairs to check
1700,2017-12-12T06:34:50.000098,Hipolito,let's say that `n` will not exceed 1k
1700,2017-12-12T06:38:55.000096,Fabiola,"By checking for `(first  &lt; sqrt(sum(range(n)))) and (second &lt; sqrt(sum(range(n))))`, you can reduce that to..."
1700,2017-12-12T06:39:01.000244,Hipolito,"but anyway, from what I was leaving it, I do not know if it comes `n` to until 1k.
I suspect that the max is much lower."
1700,2017-12-12T06:41:55.000044,Fabiola,"If I'm not wrong, even if n=1000 that still requires checking 249500250000 pairs of numbers"
1700,2017-12-12T06:43:57.000157,Hipolito,"Well, that's a lot.
But as I said, I do not think it ever came to n = 1000.
I think it's going to be hard to make it halfway. (n=500)"
1700,2017-12-12T06:44:32.000223,Hipolito,"for research purposes, let's set it for not more than 300."
1700,2017-12-12T06:46:20.000164,Hipolito,"not only do you worry about the speed of action. If, for example, I have to check with 50 x `n` where `n` &lt; 100"
1700,2017-12-12T06:46:56.000280,Hipolito,"for this, this function should be as fast as possible"
1700,2017-12-12T06:48:54.000027,Ciera,It also depends what is as fast as possible. Maybe there are solutions in C library
1700,2017-12-12T06:52:57.000309,Hipolito,"I do not say that it must be done in this way, it is completely different solution that will give the desired result"
1700,2017-12-12T07:01:18.000185,Hipolito,"oki, then how this need looks?"
1700,2017-12-12T07:06:12.000144,Hipolito,I'm just learning this fascinating language and I can not get everything in flight yet.
1700,2017-12-12T07:06:37.000216,Hipolito,Any hint how it should look like? :slightly_smiling_face:
1700,2017-12-12T07:08:39.000343,Fabiola,"Your code earlier looked really nice. On the whole, list comprehensions are much faster than `for` loops, so I think your first answer looked pretty good. Like <@Ciera> suggested, you can remove the `list`structure"
1700,2017-12-12T07:10:25.000411,Hipolito,"oki, <@Ciera>, <@Fabiola> thanks for your help :slightly_smiling_face:"
1700,2017-12-12T07:14:26.000297,Hipolito,:+1:
1700,2017-12-12T07:16:10.000201,Fabiola,You can use the `itertools.product` to find combinations of the `range(n*(n-1)/2)` and `range(np.sqrt(n*(n-1)/2)`
1700,2017-12-12T07:16:56.000210,Fabiola,"And because the product is symmetric, at the end you can reverse all the pairs you have found and add them to the solution set"
1700,2017-12-12T07:17:22.000208,Fabiola,"ie. if `(a, b)` is a solution, then so is `(b, a)`."
1700,2017-12-12T07:18:06.000517,Hipolito,nice
1700,2017-12-12T07:19:48.000461,Hipolito,"Check it out as soon as I find a moment because now I am at work :slightly_smiling_face: and will certainly write back what I sent. Once again, thanks a lot for your help"
1700,2017-12-12T07:20:34.000324,Fabiola,"Yeah, me too, it's an interesting problem! I'll try an run some of my own benchmarks to see if my calculations reflect reality ^^"
1700,2017-12-12T07:21:42.000328,Fabiola,And <@Hipolito> you can give tacos to people if you found them helpful  :taco:
1700,2017-12-12T07:22:06.000467,Hipolito,haw do this? :slightly_smiling_face:

1701,2017-12-12T08:49:51.000213,Nickolas,"Hi all,
Has anybody successfully bundled OpenCV and PyQt using PyInstaller on OSX?  I’m having a nightmare getting it to work.    Everything works perfectly before bundling with PyInstaller, however when I run the app created by PyInstaller I get the following error:"
1701,2017-12-12T08:50:22.000065,Nickolas,If I comment out the ‘import cv2’ the app works (but without the opencv functionality obviously)
1701,2017-12-12T08:50:41.000668,Meg,"IIRC, opencv dependencies are a pita to make portable"
1701,2017-12-12T08:51:06.000153,Nickolas,Is there a better alternative?
1701,2017-12-12T08:51:25.000535,Meg,I just installed the deps using a linux vm
1701,2017-12-12T08:51:41.000099,Meg,and added the python binaries via a virtualenv
1701,2017-12-12T08:51:48.000212,Nickolas,I am attempting to create a short video file from individual image frames
1701,2017-12-12T08:54:05.000175,Nickolas,Installing deps on a linux vm won’t help me build an OSX app though will it?
1701,2017-12-12T08:54:33.000392,Meg,nope
1701,2017-12-12T08:55:28.000126,Meg,"so, with this, seems like its worth escalating to the pyinstaller repostitory issue page or going to the opencv mailing list"

1701,2017-12-12T08:56:58.000283,Meg,"that said, there are a number of projects where packaging is a pain, I feel"
1701,2017-12-12T08:57:01.000212,Meg,opencv is one
1701,2017-12-12T08:57:10.000331,Meg,"gis is another (geodjango, etc)"
1701,2017-12-12T08:57:30.000165,Meg,"and depending on the machine/OS, numpy/scipy, pandas…"
1701,2017-12-12T10:37:15.000539,Glinda,But right now both sub loggers are duplicating the file.
1701,2017-12-12T10:37:33.000615,Ciera,FYI you can also use yaml for the config file (can be more readdable :slightly_smiling_face: )
1701,2017-12-12T10:37:42.000663,Glinda,I saw that
1701,2017-12-12T10:37:48.000343,Glinda,I'm kind of regretting the json
1701,2017-12-12T10:37:56.000237,Ciera,there is a key to deactivate that
1701,2017-12-12T10:38:24.000048,Glinda,So both `new_event_logger` and `all_event_logger` have the same data.
1701,2017-12-12T10:38:24.000232,Ciera,see <https://github.com/pyslackers/sirbot-pythondev/blob/master/config/prod.config.yml#L96>
1701,2017-12-12T10:38:38.000072,Ciera,ah no you already have it
1701,2017-12-12T10:38:46.000302,Glinda,"` ""disable_existing_loggers"": false,`"
1701,2017-12-12T10:38:55.000547,Glinda,Maybe something to do with root?
1701,2017-12-12T10:39:51.000325,Ciera,the root logger use both handlers
1701,2017-12-12T10:40:27.000518,Ciera,how do you log a message ? `<http://all_event_logger.info|all_event_logger.info>('my log')` ?
1701,2017-12-12T10:40:32.000156,Glinda,Yes
1701,2017-12-12T10:41:25.000215,Ciera,I'm not a pro on logging but your config seems fine to me :confused:
1701,2017-12-12T10:42:04.000258,Glinda,maybe something to do with my setup function?
1701,2017-12-12T10:42:05.000007,Glinda,<https://github.com/OperationCode/operation_code_pybot/blob/master/utils/log_manager.py>
1701,2017-12-12T10:42:36.000724,Glinda,"Not sure if I need to have ```logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
new_event_logger = logging.getLogger(f'{__name__}.new_member')``` within that file"
1701,2017-12-12T10:43:24.000621,Ciera,you shouldn't use `__name__` there.
1701,2017-12-12T10:43:50.000639,Ciera,name is the python path of the file `mymodule.submodule.filename`
1701,2017-12-12T10:44:05.000535,Ciera,so you don't get the correct logger
1701,2017-12-12T10:44:27.000578,Glinda,Cause I'm using `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler`
1701,2017-12-12T10:44:36.000620,Ciera,you should do `logging.getLogger('my_module.new_member')`
1701,2017-12-12T10:51:39.000082,Glinda,I think that's working better :slightly_smiling_face:
1701,2017-12-12T10:52:52.000640,Ciera,for `all_events` it could be interesting to just set the message in DEBUG mode and log the debug elsewhere
1701,2017-12-12T10:53:52.000691,Ciera,haha I see you also had some trouble with the stupid `Bot ID`. I can't understand why they haven't changed that yet
1701,2017-12-12T10:54:11.000278,Glinda,I'm not even sure if I need it.
1701,2017-12-12T10:54:28.000941,Glinda,But was working with someone and he included that utility to get the bot id
1701,2017-12-12T10:55:05.000156,Glinda,"This first iteration we are just using the RTM, the next step is to turn it into an app so we can incorporate buttons. Do you know if that's something your wrapper can do?"
1701,2017-12-12T10:55:48.000096,Ciera,the wrapper doesn't handle button by itself but yeah it can handle messages with buttons.
1701,2017-12-12T10:56:08.000280,Ciera,try the `/gif` command to see some buttons :wink:
1701,2017-12-12T10:57:06.000045,Ciera,"it's a bit of work to get buttons and commands working correctly as you will need a webserver, Most likely Django, Flask or an async one"
1701,2017-12-12T10:57:49.000348,Ciera,you should use `logger.exception(e)` here

1701,2017-12-12T10:59:52.000626,Glinda,I really wanted to learn async using curio first.
1701,2017-12-12T11:01:48.000172,Glinda,Been hearing lots of crap about asyncio

1701,2017-12-12T11:02:39.000766,Glinda,I don't disagree
1701,2017-12-12T11:04:07.000477,Ciera,but I can understand that there is other implementations that are easier to get into
1701,2017-12-12T11:05:53.000097,Glinda,"```  while True:
            try:
                parse_slack_output(slack_client.rtm_read())
                time.sleep(delay)
            # TODO determine which exceptions can be ignored and which can be handled.

1703,2017-12-12T11:40:36.000405,Myong,But first gotta find the request necessary to download the info I need from the csv

1704,2017-12-12T14:20:26.000344,Virgen,"Short Question: Is it possible to use a MS Office file as a source to render a webpage with one of the web frameworks? If so, what would you use? (I am looking for a simple yes/no on the possible question. And if possible, just direct me to the package/module and I'll read the docs from there...)

Long Version: Our IT dept keeps our documentation in a bunch of MS office files. It is all quite well organized and standardized. A directory for each area of IT (network, storage, vmware, voip, etc). Each folder has a single .docx, a .xlsx, and a .vsdx.
The issue we run into is that we rarely update but frequently reference. Since we all have RW permissions to the files, whenever we open one of them, it locks the file so no one else can edit. So, whenever we have to make an edit, we have to find who has it open and ask them to close it.
Its not enough of a bother for anyone else to have done anything about it, much less be willing to spend anything on a better solution.
So, my thinking is that if I could use my django server (on which I am still learning...) to host a webapp that would render a page from each of those files, we could use that as reference and only open the file when we need to make an update. 

My general thoughts on the high level program would be as follows:
1. point the program at the root directory. 
2. it would generate links for each folder, once clicked, it would display another set of links for subdirs or files. If files, it would display a page rendered with the content of the office file. If folder, display links to folder contents, rinse repeate.

I dont know how to do any of this, yet. I'll figure it out.
What I am looking for is if it is even possible to render a page with Django using a MS Office file as a source.
If I know I can do that, I'll figure out the rest. 
If that is not possible, I wont be wasting my time trying to figure it out...

Thank you for any input!"

1719,2017-12-13T16:14:51.000555,Miguelina,is the problem of adding spaces or removing them? Looks like you need to get rid of B.strip() to me (since that is removing the spacing)

1721,2017-12-13T17:39:24.000375,Miguelina,<@Gemma> in that case you won't import that method but the whole class itself and instantiate the class into a var and then call the _execute method on that var in your python script

1726,2017-12-14T09:34:55.000536,Meg,what are you trying to do?
1726,2017-12-14T09:35:11.000511,Meg,"because if you’re printint the data out to a template, you don’t need to do the json stuff"
1726,2017-12-14T09:35:24.000448,Meg,"and if you’re logging to file, you don’t need that either"
1726,2017-12-14T09:35:59.000165,Meg,"basically, I think you’re driving yourself into an area of confusion about something that has zero relevance"
1726,2017-12-14T09:36:55.000542,Ozie,story of my life
1726,2017-12-14T10:44:36.000287,Alba,"<@Meg> sorry for the late reply, the data being presented by the endpoint included the `\\` and I just wanted to remove it to make the front end api calls easier."
1727,2017-12-14T11:07:41.000391,Myong,Would it be worth it to multi-thread a computationally heavy for loop with 3000+ iterations that takes 20+ minutes to complete?
1727,2017-12-14T11:08:11.000429,Junita,how often do you need to do this?
1727,2017-12-14T11:08:23.000390,Myong,Once a day
1727,2017-12-14T11:08:45.000301,Myong,Or should I just be creating a bunch of workers
1727,2017-12-14T11:08:51.000327,Joann,really depends- do you care that it takes 20m? :)
1727,2017-12-14T11:09:15.000109,Junita,"I’d go the multiprocessing route over threading, but yeah, like <@Joann> said - depends how much you care"
1727,2017-12-14T11:09:26.000146,Junita,could be a good excuse to try the technique though
1727,2017-12-14T11:09:42.000719,Myong,Currently sitting at my desk awaiting completion so I got 20 minutes lol
1727,2017-12-14T11:10:24.000662,Junita,heh
1727,2017-12-14T11:10:55.000121,Junita,I mean if it’s something you have to wait for the result for then I’d say yes.  How many cores does your machine have?
1727,2017-12-14T11:14:25.000611,Antionette,"if the work you're doing is cpu bound I'm not sure if traditional multi-threading will help that much, wouldn't it be stuck on one core anyway?"
1727,2017-12-14T11:14:52.000150,Myong,8 total with hyperthreading
1727,2017-12-14T11:14:52.000430,Joann,huh? no
1727,2017-12-14T11:16:06.000619,Joann,"well, idk what you mean by 'traditional multi-threading' to be fair, but Linux threads will certainly get you access to multiple CPUs..."
1727,2017-12-14T11:16:42.000273,Ciera,In pure cpython you are block by the GIL
1727,2017-12-14T11:16:53.000208,Antionette,I meant python threads vs a library like multi processing
1727,2017-12-14T11:16:57.000726,Myong,<@Antionette> I believe `ThreadPoolExecutor` works properly
1727,2017-12-14T11:16:59.000086,Ciera,you need to drop in C or use multiprocessing
1727,2017-12-14T11:17:36.000462,Joann,"oh, ugh, forgot which slack I was on. :)"
1727,2017-12-14T11:17:40.000808,Joann,silly python
1727,2017-12-14T11:17:55.000427,Myong,"Multithreading for IO bound, Multiprocess for CPU bound"
1727,2017-12-14T11:18:09.000642,Ciera,really good talk about concurrency in python <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zinZmE3Ogk> :slightly_smiling_face:
1727,2017-12-14T11:18:14.000851,Myong,IIRC
1727,2017-12-14T11:18:46.000293,Myong,How many processes should I have running at once?
1727,2017-12-14T11:19:16.000147,Joann,"with 8 HTs, I'd probably try 10"
1727,2017-12-14T11:19:51.000288,Joann,you could time that and then vary the # of processes and see if there's much change
1727,2017-12-14T11:19:59.000284,Ciera,n° of core + 1 is the rule I heard but I don't really know :smile:
1727,2017-12-14T11:20:13.000621,Joann,"it really depends on a lot of different things, heh."
1727,2017-12-14T11:20:18.000058,Suellen,yeah
1727,2017-12-14T11:20:31.000028,Suellen,very hard even to estimate
1727,2017-12-14T11:20:35.000877,Joann,The difference is likely to be relatively small in total runtime anyway tho.
1727,2017-12-14T11:20:52.000362,Suellen,but it's easy to shoot yourself in the foot and make parallel code work slower than one-core-one-thread
1727,2017-12-14T11:21:20.000490,Suellen,RE: multiprocessing communication overhead
1727,2017-12-14T11:25:39.000287,Myong,Now the attempt to get `tqdm` to work with this
1727,2017-12-14T11:26:41.000239,Fabiola,<@Myong> Looks like you can afford to spend about a day or two on this before you wipe out any gains in time you make over a year: <https://xkcd.com/1205/>
1727,2017-12-14T11:27:17.000409,Fabiola,Assuming you shave 5-10 minutes off the task
1727,2017-12-14T11:27:33.000481,Ciera,haha nice chart :smile:
1727,2017-12-14T11:27:54.000588,Suellen,relevant xkcd!
1727,2017-12-14T11:28:28.000332,Ciera,I like how some are greyed out. Like `you should have already done it` :smile:
1727,2017-12-14T11:28:49.000039,Ciera,today's one was kind of happy/sad
1727,2017-12-14T11:29:18.000902,Suellen,oh no
1727,2017-12-14T11:30:15.000265,Fabiola,"wow, yeah, hadn't read it yet"
1727,2017-12-14T11:30:50.000239,Seema,"<@Myong> have you checked your time-complexity, for example, do you have inner and outer for loops?  also have you profiled the code at all?"
1727,2017-12-14T11:31:01.000875,Myong,Yeah I ran a profile on it
1727,2017-12-14T11:31:37.000067,Myong,It's basically a word likeness algorithm that runs on a few thousand inputs
1727,2017-12-14T11:31:41.000913,Fabiola,"<@Myong> I don't know what the task is, but would it be possible to run it as a cron job before you need it, so you're not actually waiting for it?"
1727,2017-12-14T11:31:59.000444,Myong,It spends about 97% of the time inside a single function
1727,2017-12-14T11:32:04.000109,Fabiola,Or is it something you need to run on up to date data when you get it?
1727,2017-12-14T11:32:05.000157,Suellen,hope it's not the slow Levenstein
1727,2017-12-14T11:32:19.000386,Myong,It's useing `FuzzyWuzzy`
1727,2017-12-14T11:32:38.000428,Myong,<https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy>
1727,2017-12-14T11:33:22.000304,Ciera,it might be a good opportunity to learn cython :smile:
1727,2017-12-14T11:33:46.000391,Myong,You could be correct
1727,2017-12-14T11:34:00.000401,Myong,I'm just not busy at work and trying to improve this little script
1727,2017-12-14T11:34:31.000407,Seema,"""cheap"" ways to *potentially* increase speed are to compile the program or try pypy, though reference that time chart for pypy :wink:"
1727,2017-12-14T11:36:15.000118,Myong,Okay I'll check it out
1727,2017-12-14T11:36:26.000856,Ciera,yeah pypi is a good idea :thumbsup:
1727,2017-12-14T11:36:49.000417,Seema,"lol, I can never get the name right"
1727,2017-12-14T11:36:50.000805,Myong,the python package index?
1727,2017-12-14T11:37:17.000206,Myong,Oh I got confused for a sec
1727,2017-12-14T11:37:36.000597,Seema,"pypy is a python compiled python interpreter, no C underneath"
1727,2017-12-14T11:37:36.000797,Ciera,haha no I go it wrong you got it right <@Seema>
1727,2017-12-14T11:37:46.000907,Seema,lol
1727,2017-12-14T11:37:51.000616,Suellen,what's happenin
1727,2017-12-14T11:37:56.000867,Myong,wait isnt that pypy?
1727,2017-12-14T11:37:58.000944,Myong,LOL
1727,2017-12-14T11:38:01.000572,Suellen,I'm confused
1727,2017-12-14T11:38:18.000393,Ciera,<https://pypy.org/> != <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>
1727,2017-12-14T11:38:35.000107,Suellen,"right, so i'm not having a stroke"
1727,2017-12-14T11:38:36.000626,Suellen,that's good
1727,2017-12-14T11:38:43.000488,Myong,what a rush
1727,2017-12-14T11:38:59.000486,Myong,<@Ciera> so <http://pypy.org|pypy.org> and download the interpreter?
1727,2017-12-14T11:39:02.000109,Ciera,!= <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pipi>
1727,2017-12-14T11:39:42.000695,Ciera,yeah with a bit of luck it should automagically work
1727,2017-12-14T11:40:09.000346,Junita,it shouldn’t?  :stuck_out_tongue:
1727,2017-12-14T11:40:17.000562,Myong,Hopefully im not lucky
1727,2017-12-14T11:40:27.000443,Seema,"*IIRC*, you need python to use C to use python to create the python interpreter so not as easy as ""download the interpreter"", you'll need to build it.  Last I saw it was a long build time."
1727,2017-12-14T11:40:52.000010,Seema,can someone tell me I'm wrong and that you can download it?
1727,2017-12-14T11:40:57.000619,Ciera,it's late here :coffee: :cry:
1727,2017-12-14T11:41:00.000783,Myong,I have a download im looking at here
1727,2017-12-14T11:41:04.000085,Junita,I think there’s a binary distribution for it.
1727,2017-12-14T11:41:06.000044,Myong,BUT Idk
1727,2017-12-14T11:41:33.000345,Seema,"at the very least, you'll learn a lot :slightly_smiling_face:"
1727,2017-12-14T11:42:36.000339,Myong,Looks like they have SVM here <http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/trunk/>
1727,2017-12-14T11:43:09.000300,Seema,Where are you at?
1727,2017-12-14T11:43:37.000319,Ciera,I'm in belgium. It's not that late but it's getting dark
1727,2017-12-14T11:44:16.000048,Seema,"My brother-in-law lived there for 10+ years, he's from California so there was a bit of weather shock.  He loved it otherwise."
1727,2017-12-14T11:44:56.000115,Seema,"I think he lived in Leuven, spoke Dutch and English, had to learn French"
1727,2017-12-14T11:45:06.000156,Ciera,yeah the weather is not too good at the moment :disappointed:
1727,2017-12-14T11:45:19.000171,Ciera,Leuven is pretty nice.
1727,2017-12-14T11:45:43.000304,Seema,he tells the story of over a 100 days of no sun and he had an upcoming bike trip
1727,2017-12-14T11:46:11.000519,Ciera,haha 100 days of no sun is a bit exagerated :smile: we are not England
1727,2017-12-14T11:46:14.000466,Seema,"just as he goes on his trip, the sun opens up for 5 or 6 days and he has this glorious ride and then it goes back to cloudy, he said the whole country kinda slumps"
1727,2017-12-14T11:47:44.000718,Ciera,well it's a shithole afterall :trollface: :trump:
1727,2017-12-14T11:48:00.000478,Seema,are you Belgian?
1727,2017-12-14T11:48:45.000102,Ciera,yeah. I was born in France but moved to belgium when I was 12
1727,2017-12-14T11:49:00.000121,Myong,Alright about to try it out
1727,2017-12-14T11:50:02.000802,Ciera,where are you at ? I suppose US west ?
1727,2017-12-14T11:50:21.000399,Seema,"northern California, east of San Francisco"
1727,2017-12-14T11:50:58.000175,Seema,"it's been 4 to 16 degrees out here and I'm not use to this, I'm from southern california"
1727,2017-12-14T11:51:18.000425,Seema,"I have thermals and ear muffs , often in the house"
1727,2017-12-14T11:51:24.000728,Ciera,is that °F or °C ?
1727,2017-12-14T11:51:27.000129,Seema,C
1727,2017-12-14T11:51:46.000744,Ciera,ah yeah that's pretty cool for California
1727,2017-12-14T11:51:53.000287,Ciera,it's around 0° here
1727,2017-12-14T11:52:29.000148,Ciera,you don't have good heating in the house ? More focused on cooling usually ?
1727,2017-12-14T11:52:42.000489,Seema,"brrr, I live on the way to the mountains so if I was a skiing fan this would be great, about 2 hours to some great slopes.  Too bad I can't deal with the cold."
1727,2017-12-14T11:53:30.000502,Seema,"Most of the houses in US are old double-pane windows that no longer hold the insulation, often about 2000square feet, so the heaters are kind of useless, the concern in most of the state is air conditioning"
1727,2017-12-14T11:54:10.000440,Ciera,yeah well I guess in the south temperature are usually higher.
1727,2017-12-14T11:54:24.000188,Seema,"It's highly variable too, in San Francisco, you might never use your heater but a couple of weeks a year because the proximity to the ocean keeps the temperature even"
1727,2017-12-14T11:54:54.000815,Ciera,at least in Belgium house have good insulation and heating
1727,2017-12-14T11:55:17.000384,Ciera,but then in the summer when there is a bit of sun nobody can handle it
1727,2017-12-14T11:55:19.000431,Seema,"central california is a giant, and I mean HUGE valley, easily ges in the 100s.... errr 40+, part of southern california too but the closer to the beach, the less craziness, the more expensive, nice community,etc"
1727,2017-12-14T11:55:38.000640,Ciera,I couldn't deal with 40+ :smile:
1727,2017-12-14T11:55:39.000054,Seema,is air conditioning a normal thing to have?
1727,2017-12-14T11:55:49.001005,Ciera,"no, nobody has it"
1727,2017-12-14T11:56:23.000015,Seema,"that's interesting, how many times a year would you say it's needed?"
1727,2017-12-14T11:56:24.000309,Ciera,you would only use it for a few weeks over the year. nt worth it
1727,2017-12-14T11:57:08.000066,Seema,"Seattle is like that and they've been having warm, dry summers.  My (ex) co-workers were miseable, weeks of hot, muggy, no relief, no way to cool at night"
1727,2017-12-14T11:57:50.000266,Seema,you working on any interesting projects?
1727,2017-12-14T11:57:51.000436,Ciera,yeah it's usually like that. But temp rarely reach 30
1727,2017-12-14T11:58:07.000072,Ciera,Average should be about 24-25 in the summer
1727,2017-12-14T11:58:27.000589,Seema,that's nice!
1727,2017-12-14T11:58:46.000372,Ciera,"Yeah I was working on making our postgresql replicate, and before that on a SIP server with asyncio"
1727,2017-12-14T11:58:56.000348,Ciera,pretty cool stuff to do
1727,2017-12-14T11:58:59.000300,Ciera,and you ?
1727,2017-12-14T11:59:43.000172,Seema,"lately, tinkering, I'm hobbyist not full-time programmer.  I've been playing with Dask <http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/>"
1727,2017-12-14T12:00:21.000328,Seema,"Also, been trying to figure out how I can level up, my decorators, metaclasses, context managers, properties knowledge is non-existent"
1727,2017-12-14T12:00:51.000296,Seema,do you roll your own SIP?
1727,2017-12-14T12:01:05.000598,Ciera,I don't really know anything about datascience / analytics in python but it looks interesting :smile:
1727,2017-12-14T12:01:31.000399,Ciera,"well it's always by doing that you learn, there is no secret."
1727,2017-12-14T12:01:40.000484,Seema,true
1727,2017-12-14T12:01:58.000798,Ciera,No but we have the need for a custom SIP server/proxy in some specific cases
1727,2017-12-14T12:02:32.000130,Seema,"I used to manage the VOIP and the Lync servers, some of that stuff is black magic, some of it cool, most of it a pain"
1727,2017-12-14T12:02:32.000430,Ciera,If you haven't already watched them I can recommend all the raymond hettinger talks
1727,2017-12-14T12:03:09.000156,Seema,"I like his, then I'll balance it with a Dave Beazley talk just to keep it light, lol"
1727,2017-12-14T12:03:14.000045,Ciera,Most of it was a pain to do :smile: but we got something working. It's not perfect but does the job

1727,2017-12-14T12:05:27.000024,Myong,Alright installed the binaries but there is no actual binary anywhere
1727,2017-12-14T12:06:35.000607,Junita,start a new shell session?
1727,2017-12-14T12:07:27.000208,Myong,On Windows fyi (save me). But it's nowhere at all let me see if this works gonna download one of the newer binaries
1727,2017-12-14T12:07:33.000692,Myong,ahhh there it is
1727,2017-12-14T12:08:12.000610,Junita,"ah, no idea about windows.  :slightly_smiling_face:"
1727,2017-12-14T12:08:37.000562,Myong,Yeah I got it. I guess I downloaded the source but for some reason there was no distinction between the two
1727,2017-12-14T12:27:35.000423,Meg,"but not sure whether you’d be able to hook into the subprocess.  that might be best left as a standalone debug, where your inputs match those from the subprocess call"
1728,2017-12-14T12:12:51.000520,Myong,Alright im excited to see how this works with  pypy
1728,2017-12-14T12:15:57.000468,Myong,just as slow so far in pypy as normal python build
1728,2017-12-14T12:16:11.000389,Myong,:disappointed:
1728,2017-12-14T12:25:33.000307,Myong,Sweet! Implemented multiprocess and the speed has doubled so far non pypy
1728,2017-12-14T12:25:43.000827,Seema,"<@Myong> play around with it, I've even heard of things initially going slower on pypy before going MANY times faster"
1728,2017-12-14T12:25:53.000491,Seema,nice
1728,2017-12-14T12:26:13.000440,Myong,Worth running on pypy with multiprocessing?
1728,2017-12-14T12:26:53.000801,Meg,"<@Mirian> if you set `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER = True` in settings, then the worker will run synchronously and you’ll be able to debug in pycharm"
1728,2017-12-14T12:29:01.000081,Seema,"that's a good question (euphemism for I don't actually know), though pypy is an interpreter with a GIL, I would imagine you'd see improvements"
1728,2017-12-14T12:29:20.000201,Seema,do tell how it turns out if you do
1728,2017-12-14T12:29:45.000481,Myong,okay about to start
1728,2017-12-14T12:33:13.000379,Mirian,"I can debug celery worker itself, just cannot figure out how to setup breakpoints within Python script executed with subprocess"
1728,2017-12-14T12:33:38.000285,Mirian,debugging the rest of the code works :slightly_smiling_face:
1728,2017-12-14T12:34:06.000808,Meg,the problem is that the subprocess runs on an entirely different process than what the debugger is attached to
1728,2017-12-14T12:35:16.000445,Mirian,there is a settings `attach to subprocess automatically while debugging` <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/python-debugger.html>
1728,2017-12-14T12:35:24.000149,Mirian,but maybe it's an external process
1728,2017-12-14T12:35:44.000254,Mirian,and I've misunderstood that
1728,2017-12-14T12:36:02.000257,Meg,I’ve never had any success with that
1728,2017-12-14T12:36:04.000223,Meg,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1728,2017-12-14T12:36:36.000103,Mirian,"anyway, thanks for the tips <@Meg> :taco:"
1728,2017-12-14T12:51:14.000026,Myong,Moment of truth for pypy w/multiprocessing
1728,2017-12-14T12:53:45.000564,Myong,It's slowly going up. 10% through and its gone from 1.5 it/s to 2.35 it/s and keeps climbing
1729,2017-12-14T12:25:00.000859,Mirian,"Hello, I've got a celery worker that runs task that involves calling `subprocess.check_call(cmd)`. The cmd is a Python script. Is it possible to debug it using Pycharm inside a Celery worker debugger?"
1730,2017-12-14T12:52:54.000504,Myong,"<@Seema> Starting out as fast as normal python interpreter w/out MP, but im gonna let it run the full length and see what happens"
1730,2017-12-14T12:53:56.000529,Seema,cool
1730,2017-12-14T12:54:12.000255,Seema,what are you using to display the number of iterations per second?
1730,2017-12-14T12:54:40.000008,Myong,`tqdm`!
1730,2017-12-14T12:54:52.000376,Myong,Awesome library for progress bar
1730,2017-12-14T12:55:03.000161,Myong,And I just found the code to work alongside multiprocessing
1730,2017-12-14T12:55:56.000280,Seema,"seems like a win, take the rest of the week off!  lol j/k"
1730,2017-12-14T12:56:40.000984,Myong,That's what I'm saying
1730,2017-12-14T12:58:53.000372,Suellen,pypy often requires warming up
1730,2017-12-14T12:58:58.000054,Suellen,such is life with JIT
1730,2017-12-14T13:01:06.000558,Myong,Just read up on JIT so now I understand
1730,2017-12-14T13:02:57.000341,Myong,<@Seema> half way through at 2.65 it/s so about 35% slower than normal python atm both w/MP
1730,2017-12-14T13:03:31.000458,Myong,Time for cython?
1730,2017-12-14T13:03:50.000818,Suellen,that's a strange result
1730,2017-12-14T13:04:05.000002,Myong,could I possibly have too many workers?
1730,2017-12-14T13:04:19.000086,Myong,I have 8 total cores and 10 workers
1730,2017-12-14T13:04:28.000256,Myong,should i drop it down and see what happens
1730,2017-12-14T13:09:10.000349,Suellen,<@Myong> how does the pool communicate with the main process?
1730,2017-12-14T13:09:31.000108,Suellen,"do you submit something to the pools, or just tell it where to read from, or..?"
1730,2017-12-14T13:10:12.000072,Myong,I submit them with list comprehension
1730,2017-12-14T13:10:18.000134,Myong,"`futures = [executor.submit(self.find_match, radio) for radio in self.missing_list]`"
1730,2017-12-14T13:11:09.000339,Suellen,and what's the typical size of the submitted data?
1730,2017-12-14T13:11:24.000503,Myong,It's a string usually no longer than ~20 characters
1730,2017-12-14T13:11:31.000089,Suellen,huh
1730,2017-12-14T13:11:41.000743,Suellen,I'm not 95% sure it's a communication overhead
1730,2017-12-14T13:12:10.000464,Suellen,"each piece of data needs to be serialized, transmitted to the process, and deserialized. And then the same when the process finishes and communicates the result back"
1730,2017-12-14T13:12:24.000386,Myong,Its just weird cause the normal interpreter improved ~80% from the MP
1730,2017-12-14T13:12:47.000670,Suellen,maybe PyPy was already fast so less room for improvement?
1730,2017-12-14T13:13:10.000295,Suellen,what if you submitted a chunk of data each time? like a hundred entries or so
1730,2017-12-14T13:13:12.000362,Myong,Difference in speed is `2.55 it/s vs 3.9 it/s`
1730,2017-12-14T13:13:59.000117,Seema,too much fuel in the carb! lol
1730,2017-12-14T13:17:02.000331,Myong,ugh now `with open()` in pypy can't take the `newline=''` argument
1730,2017-12-14T13:45:16.000625,Suellen,mine does :open_mouth:
1730,2017-12-14T14:38:34.000615,Myong,:disappointed:
1730,2017-12-14T15:11:39.000466,Mirian,<@Meg> I've figured it out! This script was an setup.py's script and I've changed it to the actual path of the file
1731,2017-12-14T14:41:08.000508,Suellen,how is it going?
1731,2017-12-14T14:53:24.000303,Myong,"I haven't run it in a bit, but it was still running around 2.7 it/s"
1731,2017-12-14T14:55:35.000386,Suellen,:disappointed:
1731,2017-12-14T14:55:56.000011,Suellen,is it public code?
1731,2017-12-14T15:11:47.000015,Mirian,and it now magically works
1731,2017-12-14T15:11:54.000674,Mirian,but I'm not sure why :stuck_out_tongue:
1732,2017-12-14T15:38:38.000566,Myong,It is not. It's just a small script that deals with data that's not very sensitive. I'm gonna profile it again on pycharm w/PyPy
1732,2017-12-14T15:46:57.000235,Suellen,alright
1732,2017-12-14T15:51:20.000461,Myong,"<@Suellen> huh, I just found something interesting"
1732,2017-12-14T15:51:35.000619,Myong,"downloaded the 3.5 version binaries, but python 2.7 installed..."
1732,2017-12-14T15:52:03.000399,Seema,how did you install and invoke python?
1732,2017-12-14T15:53:56.000202,Myong,So Installed it from their nightly py3.5 branch here
1732,2017-12-14T15:54:05.000257,Myong,<http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/py3.5/>
1732,2017-12-14T15:54:31.000228,Myong,I downloaded the top most `pypy-c-jit-latest-win32.zip`
1732,2017-12-14T15:54:39.000702,Seema,"and when you type python, 2.7 comes up?"
1732,2017-12-14T15:54:46.000479,Myong,When I go into the directory
1732,2017-12-14T15:54:51.000168,Myong,And open up pypy.exe
1732,2017-12-14T15:55:01.000071,Myong,I see python 2.7.13
1732,2017-12-14T15:55:21.000442,Myong,"`Python 2.7.13 (5ef9bb870cd2, Dec 14 2017, 07:11:07)`"
1732,2017-12-14T15:55:26.000561,Suellen,:open_mouth:
1732,2017-12-14T15:55:39.000429,Myong,How does that work lmao
1732,2017-12-14T15:55:40.000489,Suellen,very cruel joke on their part
1732,2017-12-14T15:56:00.000015,Myong,I cant find the stable release binaries...
1732,2017-12-14T15:57:12.000284,Seema,what about earlier releases like <http://buildbot.pypy.org/nightly/py3.5/pypy-c-jit-93274-44b347a2f013-win32.zip>
1732,2017-12-14T15:57:13.000305,Myong,There is only the source that you have to build yourself and it looks quite extensive
1732,2017-12-14T15:57:35.000070,Myong,And 502 error on their site lol
1732,2017-12-14T15:57:55.000166,Myong,Downloading now
1732,2017-12-14T15:58:12.000249,Suellen,very bad luck lol
1732,2017-12-14T15:58:24.000638,Suellen,you should buy a lottery ticket
1732,2017-12-14T15:59:10.000458,Myong,LOL
1732,2017-12-14T15:59:20.000095,Myong,So I somehow did download 2.7
1732,2017-12-14T15:59:24.000613,Myong,Cause this one has `pypy3.exe` as opposed to the one I have now `pypy.exe`
1732,2017-12-14T16:00:22.000331,Seema,"kbman, I'm not going to ""should"" you because I've been where you are.  I am however going to suggest that the conversion to linux can be done, it may take several attempts, much like quitting smoking.  There's a considerably lower barrier to entry for programming in linux imho."
1732,2017-12-14T16:01:00.000534,Seema,"Also, windows has some much nicer VM support currently if you'd like to play around."
1732,2017-12-14T16:01:28.000420,Myong,I'm unfortunately unable to because I'm on a work computer.
1732,2017-12-14T16:01:52.000369,Seema,"fair enough, may the ActiveDirectory gods show you mercy then :wink:"
1732,2017-12-14T16:01:58.000213,Myong,"I'm all about linux, I would love to have it, but I'm not sure that's an option"
1732,2017-12-14T16:02:04.000473,Myong,Thank you brother :pray:
1732,2017-12-14T16:02:29.000151,Myong,love me some <http://reddit.com/r/unixporn|reddit.com/r/unixporn>
1732,2017-12-14T16:02:29.000311,Suellen,very wholesome community we have here :blush:
1732,2017-12-14T16:02:46.000621,Myong,:heart:
1732,2017-12-14T16:04:05.000590,Myong,if there's one thing I hate about windows its `\` vs `/`
1732,2017-12-14T16:04:09.000471,Myong,like why
1732,2017-12-14T16:05:15.000118,Seema,"iirc, there are many places that MS will accept *nix slashes now, I was floored when I saw that.  Shows my geekiness."
1732,2017-12-14T16:06:43.000605,Myong,And maintain the structure as a list of tuples
1732,2017-12-14T16:07:18.000126,Felicita,Yea I want to subtract each pair and return a list of the results
1732,2017-12-14T16:07:44.000283,Myong,Okay so since tuples are immutable you wont be able to touch the values. You can grab them though and place them into a list
1732,2017-12-14T16:07:49.000695,Felicita,I was looking into functools but couldn’t quite think of something without using for loops
1732,2017-12-14T16:08:07.000187,Myong,There's an easier way that's a bit cleaner one sec
1732,2017-12-14T16:08:21.000540,Felicita,Yea I mean returns new list not change the existing one
1732,2017-12-14T16:08:31.000259,Myong,So say you wanna subtract 2 from each value
1732,2017-12-14T16:08:44.000125,Suellen,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [(1, 2), (3, 3), (5, 2)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [x - y for (x, y) in numbers]
[-1, 0, 3]
```"
1732,2017-12-14T16:08:51.000541,Myong,Yes that
1732,2017-12-14T16:08:54.000345,Myong,As im writing it lol
1732,2017-12-14T16:09:17.000573,Felicita,That’s perfect. Thanks guys 
1732,2017-12-14T16:09:21.000674,Suellen,:tada:
1732,2017-12-14T16:09:55.000626,Suellen,"Thanks for :pineapple:, I'll put it on my pizza :slightly_smiling_face:"
1732,2017-12-14T16:10:05.000201,Myong,dont start this

1732,2017-12-14T16:11:11.000151,Suellen,"ooh, nice reference"
1732,2017-12-14T16:12:34.000426,Myong,Okay so now I don't have the `pypy-c.exe` to install into my virtualenv...

1733,2017-12-14T16:30:57.000374,Myong,past 2.7
1733,2017-12-14T16:31:12.000570,Felicita,Izip is also a built in?
1733,2017-12-14T16:31:15.000098,Myong,no
1733,2017-12-14T16:31:17.000062,Myong,zip is
1733,2017-12-14T16:31:23.000036,Felicita,I think I’m using 3.5

1733,2017-12-14T16:34:53.000441,Felicita,<@Seema> yea but I’m only using one list tho 
1733,2017-12-14T16:36:13.000555,Felicita,"A = [1,2,3,4,5,6] "
1733,2017-12-14T16:36:29.000006,Felicita,Trying to split A into pairs
1733,2017-12-14T16:36:32.000016,Seema,izip requires that you pass the iterables that you will zip
1733,2017-12-14T16:36:41.000668,Seema,plural
1733,2017-12-14T16:38:13.000297,Felicita,Yea but in this case I set the iterable to a variable and set the size of each pair to 2
1733,2017-12-14T16:38:49.000186,Seema,you said 3.5 right?
1733,2017-12-14T16:39:51.000051,Felicita,"Actually wait I think you were right. I’d do something like zip(A[::2], A[1::2])"
1733,2017-12-14T16:41:44.000309,Felicita,Yup that was it. Thanks man
1733,2017-12-14T16:41:56.000205,Seema,you did the work
1733,2017-12-14T16:42:57.000055,Felicita,You pretty much did lol. Cant take all the credit
1733,2017-12-14T18:18:27.000449,Seema,"I think your approach is appropriate, abstract the stuff you can, mixin the stuff that needs tweaking.  I have a story that goes with this..."
1733,2017-12-14T18:19:34.000041,Seema,<@Casie> so my dad once worked as a buyer and the problem was that all the suppliers had their own way they supplied the data.  The product was a commodity so buying was mostly based on availability and price and not features
1733,2017-12-14T18:20:19.000313,Seema,"he implemented an ingest system and said to the suppliers, ""this is our system, here are the tools to adhere, we'll even teach you, if you don't adhere, we will buy from the other companies that do."""
1733,2017-12-14T18:21:58.000126,Seema,"there was a bunch of squabbling but my dad's company won because a) they were a big buyer and b) the tech the companies were offering was awful (word docs, xeroxed sheets, faxes(!))"
1733,2017-12-14T18:39:35.000253,Casie,"<@Seema> nice story! hehe, yeah it's really weird seeing all these suppliers holding on their own outdated stacks and tools"
1733,2017-12-14T18:40:58.000036,Casie,I'll try to build a little further on the design I had in mind and see how it goes :slightly_smiling_face:
1734,2017-12-14T16:06:31.000597,Myong,"Hey <@Cliff>, so do you want to subtract the same value from each?"
1735,2017-12-14T16:40:15.000559,Seema,"looks good, and....?"
1736,2017-12-14T17:58:16.000228,Casie,"What's everyone's opinion on the following (complex) scenario:

I am building a platform which retrieves order data of multiple webshops, those orders have different suppliers (depending on the products).

Each of these suppliers have complete different API's. Expect data to be mapped differently and have different features. For example:

Supplier #1 has ""Post Order"" (POST to API), ""Get Stock"" (from FTP), ""Get Order Status"" (from FTP).
Supplier #2 has ""Post Order"" (SOAP WSDL), ""Get Stock"" (SOAP WSDL).
Supplier #3 has ""Post Order"" (Through E-mail)

We have a ""BaseSupplier"" class right now, and want every feature to be a mixin (""PostOrderMixin"", ""GetStockMixin"", ""GetOrderStatusMixin""). However, these Mixins still just have abstract functions because the actual implementation for a supplier is so different. But I'm not really able to move forward on this right now because it's starting to feel ugly..

How would you design this?"

1738,2017-12-15T03:35:49.000055,Sara,i have root and abc user
1738,2017-12-15T03:35:54.000022,Marg,anyone using visual studio code . and now if you can import python-tksnack  so i can test the code ?
1738,2017-12-15T03:36:16.000318,Marg,or any other sound module
1738,2017-12-15T03:36:20.000327,Sara,i want to restrict user abc to a particular directory as in make him read only for that directory
1738,2017-12-15T03:36:38.000078,Sara,but root should have full permission for that directory
1738,2017-12-15T03:36:58.000193,Sara,its only abc user which should have read only persmission for that directory
1738,2017-12-15T03:37:00.000136,Suellen,"<@Sara> default permissions are 644 for a file and 755 for a directory, which means the owner can read-and-write, and others can only read and go from dir to dir"

1742,2017-12-15T12:46:22.000086,Devorah,or does it just do one
1742,2017-12-15T12:51:25.000332,Tawanna,didn't get it
1742,2017-12-15T12:51:52.000479,Tawanna,what are you trying to find? Find 'y' inside the array indexed by 'x'?
1742,2017-12-15T12:52:25.000197,Devorah,"My problem says - #
# Searches the 2d array 'records' for firstname, lastname.
# Returns the index of the record or -1 if no record exists
#"
1742,2017-12-15T12:52:44.000151,Devorah,so I'm wondering if they want both values returned
1742,2017-12-15T12:53:03.000634,Tawanna,"nope, I don't think so"
1742,2017-12-15T12:53:05.000503,Devorah,or just to match both then return either one in order to figure out the index of birthdya
1742,2017-12-15T12:54:43.000617,Tawanna,for quick tests like these I would recommend you using the python REPL
1742,2017-12-15T12:55:06.000300,Tawanna,"however, to help you on that matter, what is the answer you're supposed to give?"
1742,2017-12-15T12:55:39.000520,Tawanna,"(x, y) where x is the index of the firstname and y the index of the lastname?"

1742,2017-12-15T12:56:18.000241,Devorah,right now they're having me create a bunch of functions first and then piece it all together afterwards.
1742,2017-12-15T12:56:49.000405,Tawanna,I see. I don't know how your data structures are laid out
1742,2017-12-15T12:56:56.000007,Devorah,it's horrible
1742,2017-12-15T12:57:07.000038,Tawanna,"however, this seems like a dict or something"
1742,2017-12-15T12:57:23.000053,Devorah,the online ide won't let me check it step by step until it's all done
1742,2017-12-15T12:57:47.000494,Tawanna,damn. Can't you copy everything to a file and run it on your pc?
1742,2017-12-15T12:57:53.000709,Tawanna,I usually do this
1742,2017-12-15T12:58:00.000357,Tawanna,for online tests and stuff
1742,2017-12-15T12:58:02.000420,Devorah,yeah that's what I've resorted to
1742,2017-12-15T12:58:07.000577,Tawanna,:thumbsup:
1742,2017-12-15T12:58:31.000410,Devorah,it's hard to figure out with these systems what's a limitation of their teaching platform and whats the limitation of the program
1742,2017-12-15T12:59:04.000407,Tawanna,this data structure of names
1742,2017-12-15T12:59:25.000225,Tawanna,it sounds a lot like a dict
1742,2017-12-15T12:59:35.000066,Devorah,"Yes, it's a 2d array"
1742,2017-12-15T12:59:44.000123,Tawanna,firstname for the key of an array of lastnames

1742,2017-12-15T13:00:01.000432,Ozie,for me my model is a MySQL server so i can just make a direct SQL query for the freshys
1742,2017-12-15T13:00:07.000661,Devorah,but when I import it locally it's giving me the \n and when I .rsplit it's not stripping it
1742,2017-12-15T13:00:15.000517,Ozie,or i can analyze the request and pull from cache depending
1742,2017-12-15T13:00:32.000208,Tawanna,hmmmm
1742,2017-12-15T13:00:45.000242,Tawanna,you can iterate easily over the lines of the files
1742,2017-12-15T13:00:57.000592,Ozie,if you want to get real fancy it sounds like a job for an ETL to handle
1742,2017-12-15T13:01:05.000087,Tawanna,"with open(""file"") as f:
   for line in f:
      print(line)"
1742,2017-12-15T13:01:28.000126,Ozie,"keep you API totally decoupled, just parses a route and makes a data request"
1742,2017-12-15T13:01:37.000655,Tawanna,if you need the line numbers to do some specific operation you can do the following
1742,2017-12-15T13:01:38.000466,Ozie,then your ETL system handles making sure you get the right data
1742,2017-12-15T13:01:58.000003,Tawanna,"with open(""file"") as f:
   for i, line in enumerate(f):
      print(i, line)"
1742,2017-12-15T13:02:04.000208,Ozie,"of course i'm relatively new and just hacking things together, there could certainly be better practices (and I'd be interested in hearing them!)"
1742,2017-12-15T13:03:46.000102,Devorah,"So this is what I have here : ``` def load2dArrayFromFile(P):
  # Your code goes here:
  names=open(P, 'r')
  workers = names.read()

  print(workers)
  delimiter='|'

  newarray=workers.splitlines(delimiter)
  workers= workers[2].replace('\n', '')
  return newarray  ```"
1742,2017-12-15T13:05:17.000325,Ozie,"OH i just reread your thing, let me give you a better answer"
1742,2017-12-15T13:05:37.000375,Tawanna,try what I said and print the lines
1742,2017-12-15T13:06:18.000646,Tawanna,"with open(P, 'r') as names:
   for name in names:
      print(name)"
1742,2017-12-15T13:06:26.000273,Corrinne,ajax request to the server from the browser?
1742,2017-12-15T13:06:28.000063,Tawanna,just to debug
1742,2017-12-15T13:06:48.000496,Tawanna,the with block is useful as it guarantees that the file is closed after you use it
1742,2017-12-15T13:06:57.000022,Tawanna,your code is leaving the file open
1742,2017-12-15T13:07:06.000161,Suellen,the most real-time you can get
1742,2017-12-15T13:07:07.000016,Ozie,"I would whip up a flask-restful API (way easier than it sounds if you havent) then handle requests there and pull the required data either directly from a DB or from an ETL. You're front end would be handling the ""real time"" updates, i'm familar with using Angular or Knockout.js to bind elements to data models. Then you would have some ajax request firing occasionally to poll for new data"
1742,2017-12-15T13:07:22.000471,Tawanna,it shouldn't be harmful in this simple example but it can generate a lot of bugs
1742,2017-12-15T13:07:52.000439,Tawanna,strings also have the split funcion
1742,2017-12-15T13:08:24.000269,Tawanna,"you can do name.split(""|"") to get an array of strings"
1742,2017-12-15T13:08:44.000607,Ozie,"that's a good thinking question tho, what the best way to do a live check for new data...."
1742,2017-12-15T13:09:24.000374,Devorah,I had it that earlier but it was still giving me new lines in the string
1742,2017-12-15T13:09:46.000275,Tawanna,the problem was with read
1742,2017-12-15T13:10:00.000377,Tawanna,"read loads the file in a single string with the ""\n""s"
1742,2017-12-15T13:10:13.000282,Tawanna,if you iterate over the lines that shouldn't be a problem
1742,2017-12-15T13:13:53.000028,Devorah,"``` nick|julius08025978

1742,2017-12-15T13:22:32.000422,Tawanna,"idk, but your print is outside the loop man"

1742,2017-12-15T13:23:14.000151,Tawanna,I dont think that makes sense
1742,2017-12-15T13:23:27.000462,Tawanna,you can print it once outside the loop
1742,2017-12-15T13:23:34.000382,Tawanna,if you want to see it
1742,2017-12-15T13:24:21.000267,Tawanna,"btw, the object dump you posted is probably the output of print(names)"
1742,2017-12-15T13:25:00.000165,Corrinne,in your case you might be better off using a get request
1742,2017-12-15T13:25:09.000428,Corrinne,<https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/>
1742,2017-12-15T13:25:40.000334,Corrinne,You may also have to pip install the flask-cors package
1742,2017-12-15T13:31:14.000421,Devorah,"ok so now I have 4 lists it looks like, but it still has the \n"
1742,2017-12-15T13:31:51.000018,Devorah,"but if I put in rsplit() in it I can strip it but then it shows up as ``` ['nick|julius08025978', '']
['clash|shareef|07257980', '']
['robot|jones|08041872', '']
['sponge|square|09091999'] ```"
1742,2017-12-15T13:32:06.000236,Devorah,"other wise it's ``` ['nick', 'julius08025978\n']
['clash', 'shareef', '07257980\n']
['robot', 'jones', '08041872\n']
['sponge', 'square', '09091999'] ```"
1742,2017-12-15T13:32:40.000326,Devorah,sorry if I seem dense but this course has been killing me. I'm just not seeing iteration clearly yet.
1742,2017-12-15T13:40:06.000311,Corrinne,Your JS would likely look something like this..
1742,2017-12-15T13:40:13.000221,Corrinne,"```&lt;script&gt;
$.get(""<http://your-server/my-data>"").then(function(response){
    // Do something with the response
    console.log(response);
    });
&lt;/script&gt;```"
1742,2017-12-15T13:42:52.000060,Corrinne,Your flask view might look something like this..
1742,2017-12-15T13:43:12.000372,Corrinne,"```@app.route(""/my-data"", methods=[""GET"", ""POST""])
def dash_data():

        return data```"
1742,2017-12-15T14:00:06.000111,Kristopher,"<@Corrinne> thank you, I’ll reach out again if any questions. what would be <http://your-server/my-data> in this case? I’m assuming what I’ll need (as said earlier) is a file (.py) that queries the database. Would it be that?"
1742,2017-12-15T14:01:18.000477,Corrinne,You would query the DB from the view in the flask app
1742,2017-12-15T14:02:44.000137,Corrinne,"for example your `app.route(""/my-data"")` would be where you would query the server using the ajax script as above"
1742,2017-12-15T14:07:00.000075,Corrinne,"When the AJAX script runs in the browser, it makes a request to the view in Flask. The view is run and returns whatever you want it to back to the browser"
1742,2017-12-15T14:25:55.000695,Kristopher,<@Corrinne>: thank you for the explanation. 
1742,2017-12-15T14:26:36.000222,Corrinne,No probs

1743,2017-12-15T13:18:38.000224,Kristopher,"I forgot to add that my database is sqlite, not like that’s relevant. Are there any tutorials out there on ajax requests specific to this <@Corrinne>? I’ve never actually played with it."
1743,2017-12-15T13:19:39.000596,Kristopher,"I guess a better question is to ask what I can google, I have trouble with the terminology and can be spinning my wheels."
1743,2017-12-15T13:19:50.000303,Corrinne,1 sec
1743,2017-12-15T13:20:02.000395,Kristopher,no problem
1743,2017-12-15T13:21:37.000656,Kristopher,what I assume is i have a script that queries the database and ajax will call that script?
1743,2017-12-15T13:23:24.000367,Corrinne,"```$.ajax({
      type: ""POST"",

1744,2017-12-15T15:40:14.000072,Glinda,It's like a popup message

1744,2017-12-15T15:41:51.000014,Glinda,We just got ours going so it sends them a pretty nicely formatted message with buttons
1744,2017-12-15T15:42:04.000321,Glinda,And then sends a message to our mentor channel to greet them

1745,2017-12-15T14:53:22.000100,Adan,"Hi everyone, I started to implement a simple web service for image processing in Python 3.6.3. High throughput is very important, because we do real time processing. The concept is very simple - download image from azure blob storage -&gt; resize -&gt; apply some filters -&gt; response.  So I used Flask for the first prototype, after few load tests I realized that we need something asynchronous, so I switched to Tornado. But the problem of overloading still persists, I have only ~77% success requests for 250 concurrent users, which is sad (I use visual studio online load tests). I use single core VM for testing, on another similar VM I run our existing resizer written in C#, which handles loads perfectly with 100% request rate (tho single request is much slower). The logs don't have any failed requests, which means that the failed requests didn't even come into the web server request pool... I use docker container BTW, and odd thing is that CPU has ~65% load idle, tho the python processes consume 0% idle... This is my first ever web Python experience, so I'm frustrated a little bit, may be some help would be appreciated. Could it be a problem of Tornado? Docker? Should I try Sanic or japronto? Should I use another layer over built in web server in Tornado?"
1745,2017-12-15T14:56:55.000089,Rana,"I have column of time such as 10/03/2004 18.00.00 ( Hours from 0 to 23). I’m trying to convert the columns to epoch time. The column type is object (dtype=object). I tried to convert the object column to the datetime as follow before conversion to epoch:
```df.loc[:,'Epoch'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Datetime'])```
But I get this error:
```TypeError: Unrecognized value type: &lt;class 'str'&gt;```
Does anyone how may I resolve this issue?"
1745,2017-12-15T14:57:44.000467,Suellen,"<@Adan>
&gt; The logs don't have any failed requests, which means that the failed requests didn't even come into the web server request pool... 
That _is_ strange"
1745,2017-12-15T15:00:30.000168,Adan,Is it possible that the web server is overloaded to accept any other incomming connections so it just drops them before they actually logged?
1745,2017-12-15T15:12:31.000438,Suellen,"Well, it's possible, but I'm not sure. Tornado is a top-notch framework, but it depends"
1745,2017-12-15T15:13:55.000353,Adan,is it good for image processing?
1746,2017-12-15T16:27:07.000309,Corrinne,<@Casey> have you tried the <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channel? Might be a better place to start :smile:

1747,2017-12-15T19:08:08.000245,Bruno,so terrible.
1747,2017-12-15T19:08:33.000152,Bruno,were trying to clean it up and rebuild parts of it. this is one thing that will be getting fixed.
1747,2017-12-15T19:10:42.000119,Ciera,that's the one thing that I'm afraid of in mysql. That data doesn't respect enough my schemas and things will be messed up later on
1747,2017-12-15T19:10:47.000073,Bruno,this is the app that im trying to push to a python service. at least parts of it that can be offloaded.
1747,2017-12-15T19:11:25.000102,Bruno,"yea. well, they had to disbale the checks when inserting data. then put in bad data. thats the only way i can see that happening."
1747,2017-12-15T19:12:00.000163,Ciera,idk but either way it seems f*cked up
1747,2017-12-15T19:12:52.000146,Ciera,how do you get date file and timestamp mixed up. it's just scarry that something like that could happen
1747,2017-12-15T19:13:22.000070,Bruno,yea. and the guy we inherited it from knows it. it was written a couple years ago in a hurry. but now our team is taking it over slowly but surely. its in node. but next week I should have it running in docker. which then I will start trying to offload parts to a python container.
1747,2017-12-15T19:14:09.000137,Bruno,"oh no. the DATE fields were all dates, or NULL, the TIMESTAMP fields were all timestamps or NULL. the data types werent mixed."
1747,2017-12-15T19:14:29.000236,Ciera,oh ok. well anyways good luck :stuck_out_tongue:
1747,2017-12-15T19:14:34.000056,Bruno,there were a couple others too. 5 columns total i think.
1747,2017-12-15T19:14:59.000224,Bruno,yea. well i was able to import it. but now I get other errors from a different issue. so yea.

1747,2017-12-15T19:23:36.000210,Ciera,I'm not sure but it should have been installed somewhere else than `/usr/bin` and if it's not the case be carefull to not mess up your system python

1753,2017-12-16T15:26:15.000029,Wade,i don't think it'll solve the problem. Just shifting the responsibility to find the client instance to the decorator
1754,2017-12-16T16:19:54.000078,Myong,"Hey guys I have a list of strings from a separate string that I split, but in some cases if the string contains typos where they dont include spaces my script will not catch it. I want to essential turn a list that looks like this `['[usa-az][h]paypal', '[w]', 'gtx', '1080', 'ti', 'and', 'gtx', '1070']` into this `['[usa-az]', '[h]', 'paypal', '[w]', 'gtx', '1080', 'ti', 'and', 'gtx', '1070']`"
1754,2017-12-16T16:41:46.000008,Mirian,do you need those square brackets?
1754,2017-12-16T16:42:23.000011,Mirian,"if not, you can always remove them/add space and it would make splitting easier I guess"
1754,2017-12-16T16:47:21.000092,Del,Scraping reddit uh?
1754,2017-12-16T16:48:06.000006,Del,Also use regular expression to isolate your patterns
1754,2017-12-16T16:56:31.000035,Myong,Yeah just looking for regex for `]`
1754,2017-12-16T16:57:44.000098,Myong,Guess it's just `\]`
1754,2017-12-16T17:22:08.000003,Seema,"it's difficult for me to contrast the the two lists, you can use triple tilda to make code blocks in slack"
1754,2017-12-16T18:11:49.000051,Myong,I cannot figure out this regex lol
1754,2017-12-16T18:12:38.000009,Suellen,show us
1754,2017-12-16T18:26:21.000032,Myong,"<@Suellen> `re.findall('\[[a-z\-a-z]+[a-z]\]', l[0])` for this string `'[usa-az][h]paypal'`"
1754,2017-12-16T18:26:34.000098,Myong,It gives me `[usa-az]` but nothing else
1754,2017-12-16T18:26:43.000052,Myong,I've just never really used regex
1754,2017-12-16T18:26:45.000031,Myong,so not sure
1754,2017-12-16T18:34:50.000050,Myong,"This one matches everything except the string on the end it gives nothing 
`re.findall('(\[.*?\])|(\].*?)', l[0])`"
1754,2017-12-16T18:36:42.000028,Myong,Just need to figure out what to put instead of `|` to match the other string on the end
1754,2017-12-16T18:40:45.000041,Myong,The thing about it is this is a type
1754,2017-12-16T18:40:51.000054,Myong,so typo
1754,2017-12-16T18:41:00.000009,Myong,so if its in the correct format I dont need to touch it
1754,2017-12-16T18:41:34.000055,Myong,I need to separate them
1754,2017-12-16T18:41:55.000011,Myong,yeah
1754,2017-12-16T18:42:08.000012,Myong,`\[.*?\]|\]` this works
1754,2017-12-16T18:42:15.000025,Myong,in `re.findall`
1754,2017-12-16T18:42:15.000033,Corrinne,and is this the entire string? `'[usa-az][h]paypal'`
1754,2017-12-16T18:42:21.000045,Myong,Yeah that will be the input
1754,2017-12-16T18:42:29.000021,Corrinne,with the quote marks?
1754,2017-12-16T18:42:35.000067,Myong,no quotes sorry
1754,2017-12-16T18:42:51.000045,Myong,`\[.*?\]` finds the two strings with brackets
1754,2017-12-16T18:43:01.000004,Myong,"so it returns `['[usa-az]', '[h]']`"
1754,2017-12-16T18:43:10.000030,Myong,oops
1754,2017-12-16T18:44:00.000049,Corrinne,And what do you want it to return?
1754,2017-12-16T18:44:12.000025,Myong,But I cant figure out how to find the string on the end so basically `]paypal` bit dont include the closing bracket
1754,2017-12-16T18:44:23.000010,Myong,I want the two previous strings plus `paypal`
1754,2017-12-16T18:44:45.000024,Myong,"`['[usa-az]', '[h]', 'paypal']`"
1754,2017-12-16T18:45:15.000063,Corrinne,`(?P&lt;group_1&gt;\[\w{3}\-\w{2}\])\[\w\](?P&lt;group_2&gt;\w+$)`
1754,2017-12-16T18:45:57.000025,Myong,doesn't find the `[h]`
1754,2017-12-16T18:46:10.000053,Corrinne,I thought you said you didnt want the h?
1754,2017-12-16T18:46:22.000053,Corrinne,oh ok sorry i just saw
1754,2017-12-16T18:46:26.000010,Myong,No worries
1754,2017-12-16T18:47:12.000001,Myong,"The only thing though, not sure if it will always be 3 character a dash then two characters, what can I use to match any number of character? Just `\w`"
1754,2017-12-16T18:47:19.000012,Myong,?
1754,2017-12-16T18:48:02.000099,Myong,Or +
1754,2017-12-16T18:48:02.000112,Corrinne,What are the possible combinations?
1754,2017-12-16T18:48:33.000028,Corrinne,This should work

1754,2017-12-16T18:49:12.000024,Myong,Got it!
1754,2017-12-16T18:51:18.000054,Corrinne,"```import re

1754,2017-12-16T18:51:46.000005,Corrinne,Worked for me
1754,2017-12-16T18:51:51.000055,Myong,Yep same here
1754,2017-12-16T18:51:57.000015,Corrinne,woo
1754,2017-12-16T19:04:53.000014,Myong,There are so many ways people could make mistakes in the title this is gonna be fun
1754,2017-12-16T19:06:20.000085,Myong,So basically the title format is `[location]` then `[h]` then whatever else followed by `[w]` and other stuf
1754,2017-12-16T19:06:29.000041,Myong,But in some cases people do or dont include spaces
1754,2017-12-16T19:06:43.000039,Myong,And it can be mixed and matches
1754,2017-12-16T19:06:46.000037,Myong,matched
1754,2017-12-16T19:06:51.000010,Corrinne,Where is the data coming from?
1754,2017-12-16T19:06:55.000035,Myong,Reddit
1754,2017-12-16T19:06:59.000043,Myong,It's submission titles
1754,2017-12-16T19:07:12.000038,Myong,Just building a notifier for /r/hardwareswap
1754,2017-12-16T19:07:24.000001,Myong,It works but cant deal with badly formatted titles
1754,2017-12-16T19:07:36.000036,Corrinne,"hmm, probably better to make the regex more flexible"
1754,2017-12-16T19:07:44.000026,Myong,Yeah
1754,2017-12-16T19:07:49.000037,Corrinne,are all of the submissions inside square brackets?
1754,2017-12-16T19:07:54.000088,Myong,Yes they have to be
1754,2017-12-16T19:08:00.000057,Corrinne,ok that helps
1754,2017-12-16T19:08:02.000062,Myong,so if they're not they get taken down and im not worried about that
1754,2017-12-16T19:08:27.000002,Myong,So the reason I'm doing this is to check if the item you are looking for is being sold or is wanted
1754,2017-12-16T19:08:31.000022,Myong,I only want stuff being sold
1754,2017-12-16T19:08:57.000055,Myong,So I check if the index of  the item is between the indexes of [h] and [w] that way I know it's being sold
1754,2017-12-16T19:09:11.000018,Corrinne,I see
1754,2017-12-16T19:09:38.000074,Myong,It only becomes an issue if the item is in the format like `[h]1070 gtx[w]...`
1754,2017-12-16T19:09:39.000017,Corrinne,But there's no kind of validation
1754,2017-12-16T19:10:07.000007,Corrinne,Still think there's a way with regex to filter it
1754,2017-12-16T19:10:16.000088,Myong,Yeah
1754,2017-12-16T19:10:24.000059,Myong,I can always just grab the item the person wants
1754,2017-12-16T19:10:35.000040,Myong,and see if the starting point of the string is between the start of the want and have tag
1754,2017-12-16T19:10:38.000053,Myong,that might be easier
1754,2017-12-16T19:10:40.000017,Myong,Lol
1754,2017-12-16T19:11:25.000010,Myong,Instead of splitting it up
1754,2017-12-16T19:11:55.000029,Myong,"But then I have to check if the string occurs both before and after, but in that case it doesn't matter I can just grab the first occurence"
1754,2017-12-16T19:12:48.000069,Corrinne,I'm not sure how the input is received
1754,2017-12-16T19:12:55.000083,Myong,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32430620/python-string-search-starting-from-a-specific-position-within-a-string>
1754,2017-12-16T19:13:02.000046,Myong,It's received as a simple string
1754,2017-12-16T19:13:05.000019,Myong,I split it
1754,2017-12-16T19:13:05.000051,Corrinne,On the r/hardware site now
1754,2017-12-16T19:13:53.000045,Corrinne,Ok so people just put it in the title
1754,2017-12-16T19:13:58.000002,Corrinne,"`[USA-FL] [H] Paypal [W] Dell u2718q, Cablemods (black and white) for EVGA PSU`"
1754,2017-12-16T19:14:04.000034,Myong,Yup
1754,2017-12-16T19:14:50.000054,Corrinne,Ok the good thing is they all look formatted in a similar way
1754,2017-12-16T19:15:08.000037,Myong,Yeah the only thing is the spaces
1754,2017-12-16T19:17:53.000024,Corrinne,does the [h] mean payment method right?
1754,2017-12-16T19:18:14.000072,Myong,It differentiates between have and want
1754,2017-12-16T19:18:32.000049,Corrinne,they all seem to be formatted like `[h]paypal`
1754,2017-12-16T19:19:14.000010,Corrinne,"or in this case `[H] Paypal, Local Cash [W] Used 1080/1080Ti`"
1754,2017-12-16T19:39:52.000078,Corrinne,This should take care of any white spaces..
1754,2017-12-16T19:39:57.000043,Corrinne,"```import re

test_str = ""[USA-MD] [H] Paypal [W] Bluetooth mouse""

1754,2017-12-16T19:56:26.000030,Corrinne,Could you create a new dict with the keys `not in`?
1755,2017-12-16T18:38:01.000022,Corrinne,Will the string always be in the same format?
1755,2017-12-16T18:39:05.000002,Corrinne,"`r""\[\w{3}\-\w{2}\]\[\w\]\w+""`"
1755,2017-12-16T18:41:45.000066,Corrinne,You want them as separate groups?
1755,2017-12-16T19:05:40.000066,Corrinne,how do you mean?
1756,2017-12-16T19:41:32.000033,Myong,Thank you
1756,2017-12-16T19:54:20.000067,Myong,Getting a `Runtime Error: dictionary changed size during iteration`
1756,2017-12-16T19:54:40.000105,Myong,Basically iterating through the dictionary and popping off keys that dont pass a certain `if` statement
1756,2017-12-16T19:54:47.000035,Myong,I tried to create a temp dict but didnt work
1756,2017-12-16T19:55:56.000071,Myong,I made a list comprehension that does the same thing
1756,2017-12-16T19:55:59.000025,Myong,lets see if it works
1756,2017-12-16T19:56:47.000046,Myong,Got it to work
1756,2017-12-16T19:56:47.000063,Corrinne,Rather than pop as you iterate
1756,2017-12-16T19:57:20.000014,Myong,Was thjis
1756,2017-12-16T19:57:27.000014,Myong,"now `return {k: v for k, v in match_dict.items() if have_index &lt; v &lt; want_index}`"
1756,2017-12-16T19:57:36.000047,Myong,No issues so far lets see if this beast works
1756,2017-12-16T19:57:39.000032,Corrinne,tasty
1756,2017-12-16T19:58:18.000098,Myong,One thing I still haven't figured out about list comprehensions and such is when to use if at the end or before the `for` portion.
1756,2017-12-16T20:00:01.000074,Corrinne,Think you always use it after for as its a conditional statement
1756,2017-12-16T20:00:08.000199,Corrinne,But i could be wrong
1756,2017-12-16T20:00:50.000071,Corrinne,I know you can get pretty complex with some of these comprehensions
1756,2017-12-16T20:01:08.000020,Myong,Yeah I did one earlier that nearly took two lines lol
1756,2017-12-16T20:01:14.000110,Corrinne,haha
1756,2017-12-16T20:01:18.000049,Myong,They're satisfying when you get them right
1756,2017-12-16T20:01:44.000029,Myong,I remember my professor gave extra points when I first really got into python for doing list comps so that's all I ever did
1756,2017-12-16T20:01:45.000072,Corrinne,Yeah totally
1756,2017-12-16T20:02:09.000065,Corrinne,They can really condense a lot of code into a nice one liner
1757,2017-12-16T20:48:42.000077,Del,"I did something with that sub. Also used regex to get what i needed. Check out the Post, you may find a piece or two useful. <https://rorixrebel.github.io/reddit-hwswap-flask-app.html>"

1757,2017-12-16T20:51:14.000089,Del,But it also filters by location and type of transaction

1766,2017-12-18T10:05:46.000766,Meg,python shell is where you write directly to the interpreter

1766,2017-12-18T10:07:28.000437,Meg,syntax error means you’re writing invalid python
1766,2017-12-18T10:07:29.000275,Corrinne,post your code
1766,2017-12-18T10:07:38.000128,Meg,"and without your code, nobody can help"

1766,2017-12-18T10:08:36.000753,Meg,that’s an execution command
1766,2017-12-18T10:08:45.000334,Corrinne,Post the code you've written in IDLE
1766,2017-12-18T10:08:47.000142,Hassie,or pip install virtualenv
1766,2017-12-18T10:08:55.000030,Meg,you need to post what you wrote in `get-pip.py`
1766,2017-12-18T10:09:54.000195,Corrinne,Is this the 1st time you've written any code? Not asking that in a mean way
1766,2017-12-18T10:10:10.000040,Meg,"ok, that’s why"
1766,2017-12-18T10:10:33.000198,Hassie,"Yes, I'm a DBA who wants to learn Python"
1766,2017-12-18T10:10:47.000050,Meg,"ok, so you know the difference between terminal and db shell"
1766,2017-12-18T10:10:59.000219,Meg,"what you need to do with the above is write in the terminal, not the shell"
1766,2017-12-18T10:11:00.000012,Hassie,You have to start somewhere right ? lol
1766,2017-12-18T10:11:18.000305,Meg,equivalent for mysql would be you writing `mysqladmin …. ` in the mysql shell :slightly_smiling_face:
1766,2017-12-18T10:11:19.000717,Corrinne,Of course. Have you tried any totorials / courses online?
1766,2017-12-18T10:12:19.000184,Hassie,"Yes, the basis stuff from teach your kids how to program with python and automate the boring stuff... Idle worked for what I needed it to. I also used anaconda notebook to query a sql database"
1766,2017-12-18T10:13:46.000462,Corrinne,OK so you should get yourself familiar with executing python files from the terminal
1766,2017-12-18T10:13:57.000471,Meg,"no, that’s the python shell"
1766,2017-12-18T10:14:15.000462,Corrinne,You don'r run a pip command from within the python terminal
1766,2017-12-18T10:14:17.000345,Meg,that’s activated when you entered in `python` in the terminal
1766,2017-12-18T10:14:26.000626,Corrinne,exit python
1766,2017-12-18T10:14:46.000672,Corrinne,and try pip install virtualenv
1766,2017-12-18T10:15:05.000523,Hassie,in my cmd window ?
1766,2017-12-18T10:15:12.000615,Corrinne,yes
1766,2017-12-18T10:15:30.000178,Meg,yes
1766,2017-12-18T10:15:32.000145,Corrinne,type `exit()` into the python console
1766,2017-12-18T10:15:55.000466,Corrinne,Then from the terminal of your machine. run `pip install virtualenv`
1766,2017-12-18T10:16:33.000143,Hassie,that worked. So how do I save my multi-line scripts then ?
1766,2017-12-18T10:16:45.000454,Corrinne,You need to write them in a text editor
1766,2017-12-18T10:16:50.000138,Meg,use a text editor or ide
1766,2017-12-18T10:16:58.000173,Meg,"sublime text, atom, etc"
1766,2017-12-18T10:17:14.000210,Corrinne,save them with .py at the end
1766,2017-12-18T10:17:16.000239,Hassie,And then I would execute them through cmd line ?
1766,2017-12-18T10:17:23.000488,Corrinne,yes exactly
1766,2017-12-18T10:17:38.000656,Corrinne,so once you've written some code in a .py file
1766,2017-12-18T10:17:52.000088,Corrinne,navigate to the same directory as that file from your terminal
1766,2017-12-18T10:18:05.000076,Corrinne,and run `python myfile.py`
1766,2017-12-18T10:18:10.000627,Corrinne,or whatever you call it
1766,2017-12-18T10:18:31.000835,Johana,oh nice another dba. i came into python via the database world too!
1766,2017-12-18T10:18:35.000580,Hassie,Do I need to save my scripts to a specific location based off of my PATH ?
1766,2017-12-18T10:18:41.000024,Meg,no
1766,2017-12-18T10:18:46.000026,Corrinne,No you can save them anywhere
1766,2017-12-18T10:19:01.000345,Deedee,"""ahead b/c of changes not yet in original master""
""changes made for PR""
""created forked master when inro'd changes""

So in my head, this is how it all went down:
1) I forked, and a new ""forked master"" (as you called it) was created.
2) I made changes and committed to MY forked master (my fork; my local copy).
3) I did the PR and it was accepted.
4) My changes were implemented on the original master.
5) Others made numerous changes to original master.
6) I want to make a new contribution so I want to sync my local copy with original project master.

After doing step 6, I get that I'm ahead by 2. I should be on par, at best. Or one or 2 behind if new changes have been made since I sync'd, shouldn't I?"
1766,2017-12-18T10:19:08.000034,Corrinne,just cd into the same directory from your terminal
1766,2017-12-18T10:19:51.000006,Hassie,"So another ignorant question... if I see ""./path/file.py"" what does the ""./"" mean ?"
1766,2017-12-18T10:20:08.000051,Corrinne,where are you seeing this?
1766,2017-12-18T10:20:29.000682,Hassie,I'm not seeing it right now but I see it a lot in the dev community
1766,2017-12-18T10:20:37.000409,Meg,`./` means execute the file at the given path starting current directory
1766,2017-12-18T10:20:59.000704,Meg,"if you omit the `.`, it means start from the root directory"
1766,2017-12-18T10:21:28.000053,Corrinne,"open any text editor and type `print(""Woohoo I'm running a python script!"")` and save it to your desktop as hello.py"
1766,2017-12-18T10:21:35.000801,Corrinne,open your terminal
1766,2017-12-18T10:21:41.000832,Corrinne,cd into desktop
1766,2017-12-18T10:21:53.000626,Corrinne,and type `python hello.py`
1766,2017-12-18T10:23:10.000346,Corrinne,You can use idle if you want by going up to `file` and selecting `new`
1766,2017-12-18T10:25:13.000279,Suellen,"If other changes were made, you don't have them yet, right?"
1766,2017-12-18T10:26:08.000502,Deedee,I should have gotten them when I sync'd it
1766,2017-12-18T10:26:29.000048,Suellen,That's true :\
1766,2017-12-18T10:29:34.000203,Deedee,"I have made no changes after sync'ing.

Just realized that I found this last nigh <https://stackoverflow.com/a/12636345> and haven't gone through it. I'll give it a read in a little bit and report back."
1766,2017-12-18T10:30:07.000088,Hassie,"ok, i got it"
1766,2017-12-18T10:30:07.000441,Suellen,You're welcome :))
1766,2017-12-18T10:30:12.000348,Meg,probably python2 vs 3?
1766,2017-12-18T10:30:19.000223,Corrinne,could be

1766,2017-12-18T11:38:02.000068,Corrinne,You could probably use `.split()`

1766,2017-12-18T11:39:35.000582,Corrinne,Then you could split the last item in the list on the .
1766,2017-12-18T11:39:54.000233,Corrinne,And concatenate them together as you need them

1769,2017-12-18T12:01:08.000128,Myong,Yeah you're probably correct.
1769,2017-12-18T12:01:49.000601,Myong,I'm just unsure how to go about doing it. Can I load the iterator into a separate variable then open an output file and write the rows to the csv?
1769,2017-12-18T12:03:23.000467,Suellen,well I guess you can
1769,2017-12-18T12:03:36.000602,Suellen,"StringIO or something like that, which is a ""file"", but in memory"
1769,2017-12-18T12:06:33.000192,Myong,Found what might be an answer to the issue where someone had to wrap `iter_lines()` with `codecs.iterdecode()`
1769,2017-12-18T12:08:27.000566,Myong,"<@Suellen> it worked with the `codes.iterdecode(r.iter_lines(), 'utf-8')`"
1769,2017-12-18T12:09:01.000167,Myong,<https://stackoverflow.com/a/38677619> second answer.
1769,2017-12-18T12:11:32.000347,Myong,Got it to work writing the iterator directly to the file
1769,2017-12-18T12:11:34.000250,Myong,Sweet
1769,2017-12-18T12:18:21.000712,Myong,That works as well
1769,2017-12-18T12:18:51.000486,Myong,Guessing the writing to csv takes care of formatting with newlines and delimiters

1769,2017-12-18T13:01:35.000352,Johana,idk what PyCF_ONLY_AST is

1769,2017-12-18T13:01:45.000120,Chong,its part of the AST module
1769,2017-12-18T13:01:50.000429,Johana,what’s up with your csv?
1769,2017-12-18T13:01:54.000159,Suellen,<@Myong> I'm writing to you in a thread :D

1769,2017-12-18T13:02:09.000218,Johana,are you returning it as a Response?
1769,2017-12-18T13:02:09.000559,Desire,Yes and a bit more maybe.

1769,2017-12-18T13:02:49.000696,Myong,<@Johnie> I tried your solution and no luck

1769,2017-12-18T13:03:16.000454,Suellen,then it's a non-existent output directory I think

1769,2017-12-18T13:13:16.000198,Johana,i’ll have to look it up in the docs.

1773,2017-12-18T14:57:27.000674,Myong,For argv[2] you may have to separate the x and y coordinates
1773,2017-12-18T14:57:45.000100,Myong,"or try to input them as a tuple as such `(x, y)`"
1773,2017-12-18T14:57:52.000236,Fabian,yeah thats what im trying to do
1773,2017-12-18T14:58:02.000144,Myong,Yeah you probably have to separate them

1773,2017-12-18T15:08:53.000116,Fabian,so i switched all the code to ask for inputs

1773,2017-12-18T15:14:42.000363,Fabian,rather than ask the user for input

1773,2017-12-18T15:16:29.000177,Fabian,ahhh i knew I forgot the split
1773,2017-12-18T15:16:34.000154,Ciera,<@Frieda> I don't know but it wouldn't surprise me :stuck_out_tongue:
1773,2017-12-18T15:17:15.000020,Ciera,you should also check that `coords` is only a len of 2. To be sure your users don't enter crap
1773,2017-12-18T15:18:10.000534,Fabian,"I figured I would add error checking on a later version, right now I just have like 3000 counters to cut and doing them by hand I think would take 30+ hours haha"
1773,2017-12-18T15:19:04.000654,Fabian,thank you guys i appreciate it

1773,2017-12-18T15:25:34.000102,Fabian,got it
1773,2017-12-18T15:27:49.000240,Fabian,wait im sorry i'm still a little confused
1773,2017-12-18T15:28:03.000163,Fabian,been working with rust recently so my understanding of python is out of whack
1773,2017-12-18T15:28:30.000164,Myong,No problem what's up
1773,2017-12-18T15:28:35.000637,Fabian,i need to try to keep the variable names the same so they work with the code at the bottom
1773,2017-12-18T15:28:42.000126,Myong,Okay
1773,2017-12-18T15:29:25.000505,Myong,"just take input in a different variable like `coord_input = input(""Enter coordinates (x, y)"")`"
1773,2017-12-18T15:29:31.000106,Myong,Then do the following
1773,2017-12-18T15:29:52.000321,Myong,"`start_pos = start_x, start_y = [int(x) for x in coord_input.split("","")]`"
1773,2017-12-18T15:30:31.000736,Fabian,"awesome, I think I see whats going on there"
1773,2017-12-18T15:30:55.000233,Myong,"So if someone inputs ""2,2,2"" you will get a list of [2,2,2]"
1773,2017-12-18T15:30:59.000211,Fabian,we need the for loop to extract the ints
1773,2017-12-18T15:31:19.000589,Myong,Yeah it's just a clean way to do a for loop
1773,2017-12-18T15:31:47.000501,Myong,"So it iterates over the items returned by `coord_input.split("","")` which basically splits the strings at the comma"
1773,2017-12-18T15:31:57.000001,Myong,and removes whitespace
1773,2017-12-18T15:32:05.000334,Myong,It returns a list object
1773,2017-12-18T15:32:15.000097,Myong,"but the items are strings, we want integers"
1773,2017-12-18T15:32:25.000169,Fabian,"i was wondering how it returned a list, because we enclosed it in a list?"
1773,2017-12-18T15:32:53.000373,Myong,".split just splits the string up, and each actual charcter in the string is placed into the list"
1773,2017-12-18T15:33:29.000341,Myong,"so if I did `""my name is kbman"".split("" "")` I'd get `[""my"", ""name"", ""is"", ""kbman""]` back"
1773,2017-12-18T15:33:54.000338,Fabian,ah ok
1773,2017-12-18T15:34:02.000240,Myong,But it doesn't modify the original string
1773,2017-12-18T15:34:06.000580,Myong,it simply returns a value
1773,2017-12-18T15:34:46.000578,Fabian,now I could use the same coord_input variable for counter size right?  I can maybe format the message to reference counter size?
1773,2017-12-18T15:35:51.000281,Myong,You can reassign the variable but when it takes the input the `coord_input` variable is a string of values entered by the user
1773,2017-12-18T15:36:03.000680,Fabian,right
1773,2017-12-18T15:39:08.000277,Fabian,what would I do for just one value? assuming that whatever the user sends back is going to be a string
1773,2017-12-18T15:40:18.000387,Fabian,agh
1773,2017-12-18T15:40:26.000047,Fabian,I got an error from the split method

1776,2017-12-19T05:10:58.000154,Hank,My question is concerning some kind of bug that I could not understand and maybe because of my few experience with processes in Python. I am scraping data from one website called <http://castorama.fr|castorama.fr> and in my script I am printing just to show for me the products that I inserted to my database. I am using a map function and processes with Pool.
1776,2017-12-19T05:12:23.000056,Hank,Sometimes it blocks and it does not print anymore products despite the fact that there are more. I should Ctrl-C to stop.

1776,2017-12-19T05:22:43.000068,Suellen,not yet
1776,2017-12-19T05:22:55.000078,Suellen,it depends on how long it blocks on close &amp; join
1776,2017-12-19T05:23:04.000335,Suellen,if it's too much maybe something is wrong
1776,2017-12-19T05:23:26.000120,Hank,I am using 4 processes to a list with 102 elements
1776,2017-12-19T05:24:31.000255,Hank,The saddest thing is that for 90 elements it collects the information perfectly but after that it blocks.
1776,2017-12-19T05:25:27.000357,Suellen,hm.. maybe the task hangs and it's a good idea to track execution of the tasks themselves
1776,2017-12-19T07:22:27.000333,Hank,I added print before join and after but it is blocked right now and doesn't print anything
1777,2017-12-19T07:47:35.000071,Suellen,so it blocks on close?
1777,2017-12-19T07:47:46.000413,Suellen,I'm 90% sure a task just hangs for whatever reason
1777,2017-12-19T07:47:54.000090,Suellen,how complex is the worker func?
1777,2017-12-19T07:52:46.000267,Hank,it depends on 3-4 functions which are relatively simple for execution
1777,2017-12-19T07:53:12.000171,Hank,there is also a connection to database
1777,2017-12-19T07:56:36.000282,Hank,maybe it could bug on connecting to database so all the other workers wait for him
1777,2017-12-19T08:02:04.000316,Hank,"it would be an idea to put print (""connect successful!!"") after the connection to mysql"

1783,2017-12-19T14:19:33.000157,Rosamaria,_Fixed_
1783,2017-12-19T14:19:39.000691,Rosamaria,I wrote two exceptions and both are resulting in this error.
1783,2017-12-19T14:19:55.000585,Meg,I suspect this is the cause: `raise NoDeletionOccurredError.NoDeletionOccurredError`
1783,2017-12-19T14:20:12.000227,Rosamaria,"My import looks like this:
`from database import NoDeletionOccurredError`"
1783,2017-12-19T14:20:27.000263,Myong,your raise and except don't use the same exception it seems
1783,2017-12-19T14:20:46.000237,Rosamaria,"if I remove the first `NoDeletionOccurredError` and end up with `raise NoDeletionOccurredError`, it believe its just talking about the module itself?"
1783,2017-12-19T14:21:12.000059,Rosamaria,"<@Myong> I think you’re right, but I’m not sure where the mismatch is occurring"
1783,2017-12-19T14:21:33.000598,Meg,"just for good practices, I’d move the custom exception to its own module"
1783,2017-12-19T14:21:41.000381,Meg,and then import it directly
1783,2017-12-19T14:21:58.000248,Meg,like `from databases.exceptions import NoDeletionOccurredError`
1783,2017-12-19T14:22:09.000562,Myong,If you import `NoDeleteOccurredError` and that is the name of a file `NoDeletionOccurredError.py` then you need to use the dot operator to import the exception object/class
1783,2017-12-19T14:22:13.000062,Meg,that would be clearer about location and responsibility
1783,2017-12-19T14:23:19.000728,Myong,"You can also `Ctrl-B` in some IDE's to go to the definition of the object. Or right click, go to definition/find references"
1783,2017-12-19T14:24:22.000093,Rosamaria,"Ok. I’m going to try to read up on:

&gt; then you need to use the dot operator to import the exception object/clas

Get that working and the move onto dd82's suggestion and make a separate module"
1783,2017-12-19T14:28:02.000329,Rosamaria,"Ok neat guys! I had my imports in the class that was `raise`ing correct all along, but the imports in my class that was `except` (catching) was incorrect."
1783,2017-12-19T14:28:13.000059,Rosamaria,"So now it looks like

```
from database.NoDeletionOccurredError import NoDeletionOccurredError
from database.IncorrectNonZeroDeletionsOccurredError import IncorrectNonZeroDeletionsOccurredError

1783,2017-12-19T14:28:23.000486,Rosamaria,Thanks guys! I’ll look into doing the separate module now

1785,2017-12-19T15:55:14.000616,Jamaal,So ideally the algorithm db would get information and send back a score for the client side db to show

1787,2017-12-19T17:20:25.000149,Fabian,i just got it to work on the console
1787,2017-12-19T17:20:48.000077,Fabian,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(10):
...   if i == 2:
...     i+=2
...     print(i)
...
4
&gt;&gt;&gt;```"
1787,2017-12-19T17:22:16.000194,Fabian,make sure you're using the right indentation
1787,2017-12-19T17:23:59.000151,Fabian,"If anyone is able to help me out with this, I would totally appreciate it"
1787,2017-12-19T17:38:01.000147,Dimple,<@Fabian> the output should be this (c++ on left): <https://i.imgur.com/BXmUZIo.png>
1787,2017-12-19T17:38:10.000270,Dimple,ops. right
1787,2017-12-19T17:38:32.000452,Fabian,ahh then you need to do something different in python
1787,2017-12-19T17:39:26.000404,Dimple,yep.. I will do a while loop. :slightly_smiling_face:
1787,2017-12-19T17:39:34.000540,Fabian,there you go
1787,2017-12-19T17:53:40.000149,Dimple,"<@Fabian> I found a way to do it with the same way of c++:
```
myList = iter(range(10))
for i in myList:
    if i == 1:
        myList.__next__()
        myList.__next__()
    print(i, end="""")
```
`output: 1456789`"
1787,2017-12-19T17:54:08.000070,Dimple,a little ugly but works.
1787,2017-12-19T17:54:32.000232,Fabian,yeah i don't even know c++ so thats over my head lol
1788,2017-12-19T18:20:11.000179,Seema,"is there such a thing as an API schema query, I know API are (loosely) convention based.  Is there some common query to return the schema?"
1788,2017-12-19T18:20:46.000357,Frieda,"that's what swagger and the like are for, right?"
1788,2017-12-19T18:20:58.000346,Seema,"okay, I'll go check it out"
1788,2017-12-19T18:22:00.000037,Seema,"<@Frieda> I'm thinking on the opposite side, as the consumer, is there a way to ask Swagger, can I see your schema?"
1788,2017-12-19T18:22:01.000022,Frieda,i could be completely wrong re: swagger
1788,2017-12-19T18:22:28.000030,Frieda,<@Seema> i really doubt there's a standard for that. a lot of people try to hide their API
1788,2017-12-19T18:22:43.000088,Seema,"or in my case, hey government body with public API, your documentation is meh, just show me your structure"
1788,2017-12-19T18:24:17.000259,Frieda,it'd be awesome if you could do `/api/schema.json` and get a map of the api
1788,2017-12-19T18:24:28.000109,Seema,yes! exactly
1788,2017-12-19T18:26:49.000052,Frieda,"yeah, i don't think that exists"
1788,2017-12-19T18:26:53.000354,Frieda,but i'd happily sign a petition
1788,2017-12-19T18:27:20.000231,Seema,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; resp = requests.get(url)
&gt;&gt;&gt; resp.raise_for_status
&lt;bound method Response.raise_for_status of &lt;Response [500]&gt;&gt;
```"
1788,2017-12-19T18:27:39.000069,Seema,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1788,2017-12-19T18:31:35.000411,Fabian,just bumping this again now that there's more activity
1788,2017-12-19T18:33:52.000339,Seema,which variables and in what manner do you want to use them?
1788,2017-12-19T18:40:23.000289,Seema,"I'm a bit confused about the ingestion, the instr.txt gets opened and read once, correct?  If so, your `while line:` is indented -&gt; performed under the open().  Is that intended for some reason...???"
1788,2017-12-19T18:43:25.000031,Fabian,"I dont think so, it's the variables at the bottom"
1788,2017-12-19T18:51:55.000245,Seema,"use a list accumulator, close out the while loop and then you can iterate through the accumulator.  Or you'd really rather skip the iterator, you can straight assign the values manually"
1788,2017-12-19T18:56:24.000042,Seema,"then you could go with lines[0], lines[1], it's not the most pythonic way but it'll get you there"
1788,2017-12-19T18:57:38.000349,Seema,"go ahead and ask the room, I may be returning a gift that I forgot to return earlier today (doh!)"
1788,2017-12-19T18:58:48.000297,Corrinne,"During the while loop, you're re-assigning the same variable several times without doing anything to them"
1788,2017-12-19T19:00:09.000420,Corrinne,Might be worth reading the document in. iterating over the lines using a for loop as <@Seema> suggested and making lists of items you need
1788,2017-12-19T19:01:32.000041,Fabian,"thank you guys, ill try screwing with it once I get pycharm to start up"
1788,2017-12-19T19:03:49.000221,Fabian,oh i included that in the post
1788,2017-12-19T19:03:52.000241,Fabian,its at the bottom
1788,2017-12-19T19:03:58.000254,Corrinne,Pycharm will undoubtedly start shouting at you haha
1788,2017-12-19T19:04:05.000304,Fabian,hahah
1788,2017-12-19T19:04:32.000072,Fabian,"i see what you mean, was confused for a sec lol"
1788,2017-12-19T19:04:42.000117,Corrinne,Ok i see the file sample
1788,2017-12-19T19:05:32.000154,Fabian,here's a post that goes a little more in depth as to my intent with an example source file <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/183187/crop-multiple-images-from-single-image/183222#183222>
1788,2017-12-19T19:08:43.000078,Corrinne,Have you tried it by just setting some default values here..
1788,2017-12-19T19:08:53.000380,Fabian,yeah at the top
1788,2017-12-19T19:08:53.000390,Corrinne,"```major_columns = int(input(""Number of Pages: ""))
major_columns_w = int(input(""Width between cell to cell on the next page: ""))
major_rows = int(input(""Number of blocks per page: ""))

rows = int(input(""Number of rows inside a block: ""))
```"
1788,2017-12-19T19:09:05.000262,Fabian,ah that was the old code
1788,2017-12-19T19:09:21.000219,Fabian,"at the bottom is the newer code, before I was taking user input, its quicker to read a file"
1788,2017-12-19T19:09:54.000069,Corrinne,"ok, besides taking any user input or reading in from a file, have you tried it with fixed values?"
1788,2017-12-19T19:10:51.000250,Fabian,yeah once i tried setting all of them to none first at the top
1788,2017-12-19T19:11:04.000135,Corrinne,Ok and I'm guessing that didnt work
1788,2017-12-19T19:11:39.000062,Fabian,nope
1788,2017-12-19T19:14:02.000097,Fabian,would i still use the while loop after?
1788,2017-12-19T19:18:26.000199,Fabian,still getting the same issue it seems when i try this

1788,2017-12-19T19:22:24.000094,Fabian,kind of confused as to what that means
1788,2017-12-19T19:23:12.000218,Corrinne,It means you're trying to split something that can't be split
1788,2017-12-19T19:23:26.000223,Frieda,which effectively means you're splitting something that isn't a string
1788,2017-12-19T19:23:37.000083,Fabian,ah that means i dont need the split anymore!
1788,2017-12-19T19:23:40.000193,Fabian,interesting
1788,2017-12-19T19:23:57.000200,Frieda,this is where pdb and logging come in handy

1788,2017-12-19T19:30:08.000345,Frieda,and checking `locals()` shows them all set to reasonable values
1788,2017-12-19T19:30:14.000018,Fabian,oh so i should still be calling split then

1788,2017-12-19T19:31:31.000269,Frieda,just saying there's no exception raised by _that_ block

1788,2017-12-19T19:39:39.000215,Frieda,i need to get back to some form of teaching
1788,2017-12-19T19:39:44.000257,Frieda,i can feel myself getting rusty
1788,2017-12-19T19:46:27.000021,Frieda,lol we'll see how well they age
1788,2017-12-19T19:47:42.000156,Frieda,i left treehouse about 3 months ago
1788,2017-12-19T19:48:37.000174,Corrinne,That's a shame.. For Treehouse. Although I really like some of their other teachers too
1788,2017-12-19T19:51:13.000196,Glinda,I could maybe use python subprocess to `curl`?
1788,2017-12-19T19:51:55.000241,Frieda,<@Glinda> i mean...you could...but i'd probably spend my time figuring out why the other two are blocked. especially `requests`
1788,2017-12-19T19:52:43.000329,Fabian,"did all the logic look otherwise ok in my code? specifically the loop at the bottom? getting some funny results, math isnt my strong suit"
1788,2017-12-19T19:52:45.000014,Frieda,"yeah, so far, so good"
1788,2017-12-19T19:53:19.000296,Frieda,"<@Fabian> honestly not sure what you were trying to accomplish so i just cut that part. explain, in english, what you're looking to do?"
1788,2017-12-19T19:53:46.000032,Fabian,"ah ok give me one sec, its a little complex, or at least I think"
1788,2017-12-19T19:54:34.000020,Frieda,"(that's why i said ""in english"" :smile: )"
1788,2017-12-19T19:54:56.000078,Fabian,that makes sense
1788,2017-12-19T19:55:16.000049,Frieda,gotta get out of that code mindset
1788,2017-12-19T19:57:28.000260,Corrinne,"<@Frieda> I know this is an open ended question, but what was the most effective way for you to learn Python / Development?"
1788,2017-12-19T19:57:51.000036,Frieda,uh. i built things
1788,2017-12-19T19:58:11.000087,Frieda,"i mean, where do you want me to start? when i first learned any sort of ""coding""?"
1788,2017-12-19T19:58:14.000364,Frieda,or learning python specifically?
1788,2017-12-19T19:58:15.000195,Corrinne,Ok that was the answer I was hoping for / expecting
1788,2017-12-19T19:58:24.000366,Frieda,or how i learn stuff now?
1788,2017-12-19T19:58:44.000205,Fabian,"Ok so have to use a little code, what im trying to determine, is what exactly this is doing, `y = h * row + start_y + major_rows_h * row_m` ive been trying to get the right measurements  using gimp,, and i believe im manipluating the height between the major rows here, and my estimates are way off, so im not sure if this is doing what i think it's doing"
1788,2017-12-19T19:59:43.000148,Frieda,"so, i'm old. i learned BASIC in elementary and middle school. then taught myself HTML on a computer that wasn't connected to the WWW (_HTML For Dummies_ shoutout) and i snuck floppy disks into the public library to upload my web site to GeoCities"
1788,2017-12-19T20:00:05.000268,Frieda,<@Fabian> you understand PEMDAS?
1788,2017-12-19T20:00:19.000062,Fabian,Yeah its been a while but yes
1788,2017-12-19T20:00:20.000136,Frieda,<@Corrinne> was that a bit earlier than you wanted?
1788,2017-12-19T20:00:39.000018,Frieda,"<@Fabian> parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction"
1788,2017-12-19T20:00:44.000317,Corrinne,No not at all. I find it interesting to known where everyone started their journey
1788,2017-12-19T20:01:22.000222,Corrinne,Wish I had started earlier. But I'm only just creeping up to 30 :thinking_face:
1788,2017-12-19T20:01:40.000319,Frieda,"<@Fabian> so that line multiplies `h` by `row` (I'll call that `x`), then `major_rows_h` by `row_m` (`z`). then it adds `x` to `start_y` and the sum of that to `z` . finally it assigns the sum of that to `y`"
1788,2017-12-19T20:01:59.000227,Frieda,<@Corrinne> there's no max age on programming
1788,2017-12-19T20:02:22.000019,Frieda,one of the reasons i went to ORM was because i got interviewed by a recent hire who looked to be in their 50s
1788,2017-12-19T20:02:30.000203,Corrinne,"The thing I realised shortly after starting to learn python / Web dev, is that you need to grasp a whole load of other technologies to put it to good use"
1788,2017-12-19T20:02:52.000356,Frieda,web dev is one of the hardest disciplines because you have to understand so many moving parts
1788,2017-12-19T20:03:00.000172,Fabian,I think I see
1788,2017-12-19T20:03:07.000031,Corrinne,"frameworks, servers, git, docker, aws, app engine etc.."
1788,2017-12-19T20:03:08.000094,Frieda,each part is pretty simple but the cognitive load is no joke
1788,2017-12-19T20:03:22.000244,Corrinne,Yeah exactly
1788,2017-12-19T20:03:57.000102,Fabian,ah ok i get it now
1788,2017-12-19T20:04:00.000340,Fabian,thank you again!
1788,2017-12-19T20:04:10.000155,Frieda,<@Fabian> break it out into multiple steps if you need to
1788,2017-12-19T20:04:12.000144,Corrinne,It's all time and experience though
1788,2017-12-19T20:04:13.000011,Frieda,code is cheap
1788,2017-12-19T20:04:21.000317,Frieda,obvious code &gt; clever code
1788,2017-12-19T20:04:32.000067,Corrinne,True

1788,2017-12-19T20:08:02.000113,Corrinne,Ooh yeh I've watched a few vids on GO. Doesn't look friendly
1788,2017-12-19T20:13:23.000162,Frieda,"it's an interesting language, and definitely fast. but not friendly"

1789,2017-12-19T19:02:37.000159,Corrinne,Probably worth throwing in a screenshot or sample of the `instr.txt` too

1793,2017-12-20T04:40:54.000118,Ciera,ssl is a pain in python
1793,2017-12-20T04:40:58.000562,Ciera,what version ?
1793,2017-12-20T04:56:10.000388,Suellen,betting on 2.7
1793,2017-12-20T04:56:43.000199,Suellen,my bet is 2.7.9
1793,2017-12-20T04:56:48.000511,Ciera,there are a lot of 2.7 sadly. But it might just be a self signed certificates
1793,2017-12-20T04:57:16.000457,Suellen,"I remember troubles with normal certs on 2.7, it was related to an old version of system openssl"
1793,2017-12-20T04:57:44.000289,Ciera,yeah and newer version of TLS are not available I believe
1793,2017-12-20T04:58:10.000511,Ciera,got trouble with the postgresql apt repo with ansible not too long ago due to python2.7
1793,2017-12-20T04:59:13.000276,Suellen,Why did you change `ovv` to `Ovv`?

1793,2017-12-20T05:01:43.000452,Ciera,and to differentiate with all my test accounts

1793,2017-12-20T05:05:50.000021,Ciera,can you share the url ?
1793,2017-12-20T05:05:59.000166,Ciera,are you sure the certs is a valid one ?
1793,2017-12-20T05:06:19.000041,Chaya,also when I try to pip upgrade I get `certificate: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate`

1793,2017-12-20T05:10:30.000034,Ciera,probably something with the openssl installed and the certificates
1793,2017-12-20T05:10:33.000154,Suellen,well there you have it!
1793,2017-12-20T05:10:41.000058,Ciera,ah well it's something else :smile:
1793,2017-12-20T05:10:52.000052,Suellen,good old expiration
1793,2017-12-20T05:11:17.000138,Chaya,but why then pip also shows ssl erros?
1793,2017-12-20T05:11:28.000536,Ciera,proxy ?
1793,2017-12-20T05:11:40.000399,Chaya,hmm...
1793,2017-12-20T05:11:46.000224,Chaya,not sure
1793,2017-12-20T05:11:55.000276,Suellen,Try `pip -vvv [command]`
1793,2017-12-20T05:12:01.000235,Suellen,it's probably gonna spill a lot more details
1793,2017-12-20T05:12:20.000146,Suellen,if your network does something like mitm it's gonna be funny :|

1793,2017-12-20T05:17:49.000107,Chaya,Hm.. I will try to add certificate manually
1793,2017-12-20T06:49:27.000349,Chaya,so I figure out what was wrong
1793,2017-12-20T06:50:03.000388,Chaya,server date was `2018-12-20`

1794,2017-12-20T08:30:02.000164,Ciera,you can use `git reflog` to find a commit to go back to I think
1794,2017-12-20T08:30:29.000374,Mariano,Ok. Crossing my fingers here
1794,2017-12-20T08:34:17.000305,Mariano,yeah i fuckup

1795,2017-12-20T09:59:12.000141,Bella,"Could someone to explain me, why we need to use `generators`, and for which reasons?"
1795,2017-12-20T10:01:19.000468,Ciera,<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1twn9kLmYg> if you have 4 hours to spare :smile:
1795,2017-12-20T10:09:46.000406,Bella,"<@Ciera> thanks, for the video! but could you explain in two words, why need to use generatos? sometimes, I’m a little bit confused."
1795,2017-12-20T10:10:32.000322,Ciera,the goal are to win memory and sometime time
1795,2017-12-20T10:10:58.000454,Ciera,"```
for x in [1,2,3,4,5]:
  if x == 2:
    break
```"
1795,2017-12-20T10:11:24.000432,Ciera,For example in this loop it will exit on the second item
1795,2017-12-20T10:12:33.000275,Ciera,so there isn't really a need to create a list with 5 item. If I have something that can give the item one by one I will win a bif of memory
1795,2017-12-20T10:13:49.000148,Ciera,"```
def give_items():
  result = []
  for x in range(10):
     time.sleep(2)
     results.append(x)
  return results

for x in give_items():
  if x == 2:
    break
```"
1795,2017-12-20T10:14:30.000305,Ciera,In this case `give_items` will take a lot of time to return the full results
1795,2017-12-20T10:15:03.000770,Ciera,"```
def give_items():
  for y in range(10):
     time.sleep(2)
     yield y

for x in give_items():
  if x == 2:
    break
```"
1795,2017-12-20T10:15:36.000414,Ciera,In this case it will be faster because once `give_items` yield 2 I can continue
1795,2017-12-20T10:16:05.000132,Ciera,does that make sense <@Bella> ?
1795,2017-12-20T10:18:14.000669,Bella,<@Ciera> Yes! thanks for the explanation! and main goal of generatos it’s save time?
1795,2017-12-20T10:18:52.000262,Ciera,mainly memory (I didn't really illustrate that here but imagine if the list is 1 million item long)
1795,2017-12-20T10:19:18.000303,Ciera,it can save time but if you need to complete the loop if will take the same time
1795,2017-12-20T10:19:54.000055,Bella,"<@Ciera> Okay, got it! thanks;)"
1795,2017-12-20T10:20:05.000176,Ciera,:thumbsup:
1795,2017-12-20T10:20:53.000206,Ciera,The video is really worth watching (as all :dabeaz: videos). Maybe not everything but just the beginning if you don't have the time
1795,2017-12-20T10:24:22.000706,Bella,"<@Ciera> Yeah, David Beazley discuss about generators and etc a lot:slightly_smiling_face:"
1795,2017-12-20T10:34:52.000635,Ciera,"the cleanest way would be to use the `multiprocessing` module, but then you don't launch a file"

1796,2017-12-20T10:58:25.000478,Ciera,are you sure it's what you want ? what do you want to check ?
1796,2017-12-20T10:58:45.000113,Ashlea,I want to make sure that the length of node.text is higher than the length of target.
1796,2017-12-20T10:58:56.000419,Ciera,<@Elsie> do you get any output on `stderr` or `stdout` ?
1796,2017-12-20T10:58:58.000375,Ashlea,Or equal.
1796,2017-12-20T10:59:18.000129,Ciera,you should use `len(my_string)` I believe
1796,2017-12-20T10:59:43.000549,Elsie,<@Ciera> How should I check that?
1796,2017-12-20T10:59:57.000038,Ashlea,"That throws the same error. Also, pylint states that you may not use len as a conditional value."

1796,2017-12-20T11:20:32.000369,Antionette,Something seems off because the snippet you posted definitely does not appear to contain any iteration and comparisons/len called on None types would have thrown different error
1796,2017-12-20T11:20:47.000501,Ashlea,I thought the same.
1796,2017-12-20T11:21:20.000216,Ashlea,"Chances are the debugger is not clear enough, rather than that piece of code being incorrect?"
1796,2017-12-20T11:22:47.000262,Antionette,Ok the problem is the function `getFirstRec` is not returning anything but you are splitting the return values which has an implicit iteration
1796,2017-12-20T11:23:58.000847,Ashlea,So we're missing a return statement then.
1796,2017-12-20T11:24:18.000687,Antionette,well with that part you said was commented out

1798,2017-12-20T13:20:56.000328,Suellen,"as `params` is applied to an URL as urlencoded parameters, like this: `GetDiagnosticFile?filename=string`"
1798,2017-12-20T13:21:09.000303,Suellen,not as POST body
1798,2017-12-20T13:21:28.000308,Mirian,I agree with <@Suellen> - don't set Content-Length by yourself (it's not the character count)
1798,2017-12-20T13:27:42.000548,Glinda,"Either way, the request I tried posting"
1798,2017-12-20T13:27:50.000061,Glinda,should have returned any response?
1798,2017-12-20T13:27:58.000269,Glinda,It was just hanging forever until I added timeout.
1798,2017-12-20T13:28:38.000520,Suellen,"likely, yes"
1798,2017-12-20T13:28:48.000382,Suellen,but it's best to test with a correct request
1798,2017-12-20T13:30:45.000314,Myong,Can I use a process pool to run a function on a list lists that modifies values and returns the updated list of lists?
1798,2017-12-20T13:31:05.000229,Glinda,"Okay, now I'm getting a 503 :disappointed:"
1798,2017-12-20T13:31:58.000731,Winnifred,"<@Myong>, I'd guess you would have to think about how you map out the work there."
1798,2017-12-20T13:32:16.000451,Suellen,<@Glinda> better than nothing :))
1798,2017-12-20T13:33:15.000061,Glinda,Hmm
1798,2017-12-20T13:34:15.000622,Suellen,what's the response body?
1798,2017-12-20T13:34:21.000298,Suellen,maybe there's a hint

1798,2017-12-20T13:36:00.000004,Glinda,Invalid internal server?
1798,2017-12-20T13:37:44.000207,Suellen,:o
1798,2017-12-20T13:38:41.000381,Myong,"I'm guessing something like this may work...
Split the list into n equal parts where n = num of workers
Then submit each list to be worked on"
1798,2017-12-20T13:38:55.000193,Winnifred,^^ same thing I was thinking
1798,2017-12-20T13:39:43.000222,Winnifred,"can you operate on each list in the ""master"" list?"
1798,2017-12-20T13:39:55.000008,Myong,What do you mean
1798,2017-12-20T13:40:23.000683,Myong,I can access and take values then modify them and return a different list
1798,2017-12-20T13:40:33.000075,Myong,then `del()` the old one to save memory
1798,2017-12-20T13:41:01.000437,Winnifred,"is your structure like `[ [ ],[ ],[ ] ]` ?"
1798,2017-12-20T13:41:55.000201,Myong,Yeah
1798,2017-12-20T13:42:00.000220,Myong,BUT
1798,2017-12-20T13:42:04.000132,Winnifred,"if so, each process/thread can work on each list and modify them in place (I think)."
1798,2017-12-20T13:42:45.000399,Myong,Technically it's not in that format
1798,2017-12-20T13:42:47.000711,Myong,when I get it
1798,2017-12-20T13:43:46.000427,Myong,"Cause atm I basically run requests that pull a .csv from online and save into a list of lists where each internal list is a row in the .csv, however I do this ~9 times so I have a list of 9 lists with thousands of other lists within"
1798,2017-12-20T13:44:15.000417,Myong,"So it's sort of setup already, however I don't want to just send those lists in cause one might be 5k items and another might be 500"
1798,2017-12-20T13:45:14.000660,Myong,"I flatten the masterlist from `[ [ [ ], [ ] ], [ [ ], [ ] ] ]` -&gt; `[ [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ] ]`"
1798,2017-12-20T13:46:06.000758,Myong,"But at that points its one main list of thousands of entries, and I need to split it up evenly so I may just do something like"
1798,2017-12-20T13:46:56.000726,Suellen,pool knows which process so submit to
1798,2017-12-20T13:48:12.000271,Winnifred,You want to distribute work evenly? 
1798,2017-12-20T13:48:14.000729,Myong,`[master_list[len(master_list) / num_workers * n : (len(master_list) / num_workers * n+1) - 1] for i in range(num_workers-1))]`
1798,2017-12-20T13:50:41.000099,Myong,If the syntax works that should be okay but there may be some quirks
1798,2017-12-20T13:50:56.000435,Myong,I will do some quick test
1798,2017-12-20T13:51:32.000746,Winnifred,"I would go about it the same way. To get stuff done, I’d try without distributing work and then optimize like you’re doing. "
1798,2017-12-20T13:52:03.000027,Myong,Good point
1798,2017-12-20T13:52:14.000276,Collette,"I'd do
```
with ProcessPoolExecutor() as pool:
    futures = [pool.submit(worker, sublist) for sublist in yourlist]
    # Deal with completed futures, probably by using
    # concurrent.futures.as_completed
```"
1798,2017-12-20T13:52:59.000101,Myong,Even if more sublists than workers for now?
1798,2017-12-20T13:53:03.000353,Collette,"The executor maintains a job queue, why would you invent one outside of the pool by chunking the input?"
1798,2017-12-20T13:53:11.000208,Collette,Sure
1798,2017-12-20T13:53:19.000046,Myong,Yeah you have a good point
1798,2017-12-20T13:54:22.000345,Marlon,"I have an idea for a project I want to start, but every time I get a computer in front of me I don't know what to do. "
1798,2017-12-20T13:54:40.000135,Marlon,Any tips for jumping this mental barrier? 
1798,2017-12-20T13:55:08.000771,Ciera,start small and iterate over it
1798,2017-12-20T13:56:48.000375,Suellen,"```
for i in small.start():
```"
1798,2017-12-20T13:58:05.000110,Marlon,Hah. I'm not even sure how to start with the design
1798,2017-12-20T13:58:38.000018,Marlon,I guess that doesn't matter. Cli.py can be refacotrd 
1798,2017-12-20T13:58:49.000009,Ciera,I hope `small.start` is a generator <@Suellen>
1798,2017-12-20T13:59:00.000369,Suellen,of course it is
1798,2017-12-20T13:59:12.000250,Suellen,we can make our own rules!
1798,2017-12-20T14:00:03.000087,Marlon,"Now that I think about it, I'm kind of recreating cookiecutter"
1798,2017-12-20T14:00:55.000086,Marlon,"I want to have a template file, pass in a yaml file and template the vars from the yaml into a templated doc "
1798,2017-12-20T14:21:15.000049,Myong,<@Collette> I can either submit a list of items to be processed which can be a bit long OR I can submit a single job at a time via `executor.submit()`. Which would be more beneficial? Many smaller jobs OR few very large jobs in comparison
1799,2017-12-20T14:31:31.000695,Suellen,bigger chunks -&gt; less overhead
1799,2017-12-20T14:32:45.000358,Winnifred,we want speed though :racing_car:
1799,2017-12-20T14:33:27.000327,Myong,:parrot_fast:
1799,2017-12-20T14:34:46.000500,Myong,It's not gonna be more than ~200MB of data ever really
1799,2017-12-20T14:34:52.000433,Myong,In this case
1799,2017-12-20T14:35:25.000315,Winnifred,"I like trying to scale ""horizontally"""
1799,2017-12-20T14:35:26.000238,Suellen,"if you want speed with ProcessPoolExecutor: 
try to reduce the amount of data transmitted
Giving each worker a huge data structure and getting it back is generally not good
Giving a small piece of data so that each worker completes in about 0.1s is generally not good too"
1799,2017-12-20T14:35:40.000498,Collette,It really depends on what your worker function does
1799,2017-12-20T14:36:05.000457,Myong,"Sounds good. The worker function checks at a certain index in a list if it exists, then have some Regex that grabs a piece of it"
1799,2017-12-20T14:36:07.000178,Collette,And which pool you're using
1799,2017-12-20T14:36:24.000175,Myong,I'm basically converting lat and long in degrees minutes seconds to lat and long in decimal form
1799,2017-12-20T14:36:28.000429,Myong,for a few thousand entries
1799,2017-12-20T14:36:41.000606,Myong,I'm using processprool atm
1799,2017-12-20T14:37:01.000738,Collette,"<@Myong> if you'll chunk the data by cpu cores, don't forget about grouper recipe from <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html>"
1799,2017-12-20T14:37:31.000499,Winnifred,eli5: when would you guys use processpool vs. threadpool? what's the core difference?
1799,2017-12-20T14:37:44.000446,Collette,And try switching to ThreadPoolExecutor - it may reduce execution times significantly
1799,2017-12-20T14:37:58.000390,Myong,I think it's based on IO and CPU usage
1799,2017-12-20T14:38:07.000432,Myong,Okay will do
1799,2017-12-20T14:38:58.000321,Suellen,<@Collette> GIL though
1799,2017-12-20T14:39:42.000320,Collette,GIL only applies to bytecode execution
1799,2017-12-20T14:39:50.000117,Myong,What should i be using groupby for?
1799,2017-12-20T14:40:16.000208,Suellen,doesn't kbman intend to compute stuff massively?
1799,2017-12-20T14:40:54.000488,Collette,"If you do lots of math via numpy or `math` (which are basically C), you may be avoiding GIL at all"
1799,2017-12-20T14:41:16.000004,Myong,"I'm, for the most part, only doing regex"
1799,2017-12-20T14:41:17.000193,Suellen,:thinking_face: makes sense
1799,2017-12-20T14:41:21.000019,Suellen,oh
1799,2017-12-20T14:41:42.000576,Myong,But it's a pretty crazy regex token though it picks up everthing I need
1799,2017-12-20T14:42:30.000657,Ozie,oh? lemme see that regex pattern I love me some regex
1799,2017-12-20T14:42:39.000032,Ozie,unless you already posted it
1799,2017-12-20T14:42:59.000409,Myong,"`[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?\d*(?:[eE][-+]?\d+)`"
1799,2017-12-20T14:43:06.000423,Myong,It catches all floats and integers
1799,2017-12-20T14:45:02.000676,Ozie,all your values have the `e` for exponent?
1799,2017-12-20T14:45:15.000331,Myong,No they do not I am gonna get rid of that
1799,2017-12-20T14:45:21.000058,Ozie,yeeee
1799,2017-12-20T14:45:21.000355,Myong,It was just from stack overflow
1799,2017-12-20T14:45:31.000389,Myong,no ngetatives either
1799,2017-12-20T14:45:34.000344,Ozie,i threw it at <https://regexr.com/> it's my go to for easy tests

1799,2017-12-20T14:47:56.000068,Ozie,it wont pick it up

1799,2017-12-20T14:48:35.000126,Ozie,breaking regexes is clearly more interesting than fixing this bug i should be fixing
1799,2017-12-20T14:48:50.000109,Myong,Not sure where that one is messing up
1799,2017-12-20T14:49:24.000034,Myong,It doesn't match any single digit number
1799,2017-12-20T14:49:39.000180,Myong,no bueno
1799,2017-12-20T14:49:39.000397,Ozie,lol append a `|(\d)`
1799,2017-12-20T14:49:50.000075,Ozie,the least elegant
1799,2017-12-20T14:50:21.000129,Myong,easy enough
1799,2017-12-20T14:50:31.000035,Myong,Will that provide the same output
1799,2017-12-20T14:50:41.000591,Myong,or does that create another group with `re.finall()`
1799,2017-12-20T14:50:59.000017,Ozie,oh it would def create another group
1799,2017-12-20T14:51:13.000188,Ozie,"that was a solution, but not a good solution"
1799,2017-12-20T14:51:32.000180,Myong,no it works actually
1799,2017-12-20T14:51:39.000334,Myong,gives me a single list
1799,2017-12-20T14:51:58.000202,Ozie,"nice, i still think there's an elegant way to do that"
1799,2017-12-20T14:52:20.000376,Ozie,what if you delete that last `\d`
1799,2017-12-20T14:52:35.000288,Ozie,i think that's what makes it require 2 numbers
1799,2017-12-20T14:53:01.000280,Myong,Might have to go with original one :confused:
1799,2017-12-20T14:53:01.000460,Ozie,almost positive
1799,2017-12-20T14:53:21.000731,Ozie,"`[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?` as opposed to `[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?\d`"
1799,2017-12-20T14:54:15.000593,Myong,Yeah the thing is that I need to catch decimals also
1799,2017-12-20T14:54:27.000726,Myong,The original very first one does exactly what I need
1799,2017-12-20T14:54:34.000227,Myong,and it's actually pretty quick
1799,2017-12-20T14:54:41.000418,Myong,We shall see I appreciate the help
1799,2017-12-20T14:55:11.000056,Ozie,"right on, for me that first one `[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?\d*(?:[eE][-+]?\d+)` seemed to require the `e` for exponent"
1799,2017-12-20T14:55:45.000802,Ozie,"`[-+]?[.]?[\d]+(?:,\d\d\d)*[\.]?\d*` this part seems fine though"

But if its an easy setup it could be fine. I also saw RQ as well.

1801,2017-12-20T17:10:05.000076,Johana,i used python-rq for a long time but after learning celery i probably would have just used celery.
1801,2017-12-20T17:10:14.000129,Johana,the Python Cookbook has some really good examples too.
1801,2017-12-20T17:10:20.000018,Johana,if you want something minimal.
1801,2017-12-20T17:11:21.000174,Bruno,ok cool. so celery is easy to get setup? ill have to check out the cookbook
1801,2017-12-20T17:11:59.000466,Bruno,"does celery need redis? using docker, would it need to talk with a redis container for storage?"

1801,2017-12-20T17:25:49.000293,Johana,celery needs some kind of broker.
1801,2017-12-20T17:26:09.000327,Johana,you can use redis or rabbitmq.
1801,2017-12-20T17:28:58.000120,Bruno,oh i was thinking rabbitmq was synonymous with celery
1801,2017-12-20T17:29:44.000008,Johana,"nope, it’s a broker. they are often used together so probably why you thought that."
1801,2017-12-20T17:29:58.000150,Bruno,ah
1801,2017-12-20T17:30:15.000087,Johana,when you instantiate celery you pass the connection string to the broker.
1801,2017-12-20T17:30:47.000002,Bruno,"hmm. in node theres a library called `kue` which is nice since we just import it, and it talks to redis directly to handle the queue."
1801,2017-12-20T17:30:58.000313,Bruno,ah ok.
1801,2017-12-20T17:32:26.000020,Johana,this is my celery config. some of the tasks are loading the database with data as others are computing student mastery of topics and other things. <https://github.com/openstax/biglearn-sparfa-server/blob/master/sparfa_server/celery.py>
1801,2017-12-20T17:34:31.000324,Johana,aside from that you add a task decorator to whatever functions you want to execute async and that’s about it.
1801,2017-12-20T17:37:07.000324,Johana,oh and you have to make sure to run your celery workers process and then run your celery beat process
1801,2017-12-20T17:37:22.000215,Johana,if you want to use celery-beat
1801,2017-12-20T17:37:33.000248,Bruno,"when using the decorator, it puts the funtion into the queue based on when it does I/O ?"
1801,2017-12-20T17:38:03.000069,Bruno,or just when the function is called
1801,2017-12-20T17:38:27.000229,Johana,"the latter, wherever you decide to use it in code you will have `.delay()` method."
1801,2017-12-20T17:38:47.000032,Johana,my_async_function.delay()
1801,2017-12-20T17:38:48.000027,Bruno,"oh wait, with the config. i think i see. so the config is basically scheduling these ""loaders"" to run at given intervals?"
1801,2017-12-20T17:38:59.000179,Johana,"yep, that part is using celery-beat."
1801,2017-12-20T17:39:01.000511,Bruno,ah ok.
1801,2017-12-20T17:39:15.000093,Johana,if you’re not running anything on a schedule you can ignore all that.
1801,2017-12-20T17:39:19.000408,Bruno,ok. so thats more like running it as a cron setup?
1801,2017-12-20T17:39:45.000247,Johana,"yea, you can use cron syntax or some others iirc."
1801,2017-12-20T17:40:04.000309,Bruno,"well, thats interesting. part of this is running on a cron like setup. but that, is processing some data and when work needs to be done, we want to send that to another queue so workers can process it."
1801,2017-12-20T17:41:00.000294,Bruno,currently this is all in one shitty service and managed through a Thread.js file and is messy. so were going to rebuild it and looking at using node or python. im pushing for python.
1801,2017-12-20T17:41:44.000201,Johana,sounds like it would be achievable in celery.
1801,2017-12-20T17:41:56.000101,Bruno,"so the ""thread"" is run and looks to see if anything needs to be processed. if it does, it preps it, then starts up to 10 threads to do the work."
1801,2017-12-20T17:42:25.000191,Bruno,"those threads doing the work, we just want as workers to monitor a queue to see when work needs to be done."
1801,2017-12-20T17:43:09.000482,Johana,"yea, that’s why we have the different queues. you can create different ones for different workers.. you can add priority and other things."
1801,2017-12-20T17:43:40.000482,Bruno,ok cool. so why did you switch from RQ to celery?
1801,2017-12-20T17:44:14.000432,Johana,we use celery in a lot of our other apps so it was to remain consistent.
1801,2017-12-20T17:44:22.000364,Johana,i was the outlier using RQ.
1801,2017-12-20T17:44:47.000030,Bruno,ah. are there benefits to using RQ?
1801,2017-12-20T17:45:10.000423,Johana,it’s “simpler”.
1801,2017-12-20T17:45:40.000123,Bruno,would it do what I need in your opinion based on what I described?
1801,2017-12-20T17:45:47.000257,Johana,celery is often touted as having a large learning curve. that’s why i avoided it. but after working with it it isn’t all that bad.
1801,2017-12-20T17:46:01.000379,Bruno,ok
1801,2017-12-20T17:46:24.000106,Johana,"yea, i don’t see why not. you may need to do a quick spike to see what you like best."
1801,2017-12-20T17:46:35.000171,Bruno,yea.
1801,2017-12-20T17:46:49.000160,Bruno,"so how is celery ""distributed"" ? looking at their page."
1801,2017-12-20T17:47:04.000225,Bruno,so you can have multiple instances replicating each others queues?
1801,2017-12-20T17:47:37.000037,Bruno,"mostly, the threads that run and to the processes are long running and take time."
1801,2017-12-20T17:48:05.000211,Johana,the workers are distributing the work and you can distribute the workers among any number of machines. they all know how to talk to each other b/c of the broker.
1801,2017-12-20T17:48:15.000213,Bruno,a larger process takes about 10 minutes. some times more. it takes about 10 hours to run them for all clients. and its done daily
1801,2017-12-20T17:48:31.000512,Bruno,ah ok. you cant do that with RQ?
1801,2017-12-20T17:48:47.000213,Bruno,or as easily?
1801,2017-12-20T17:48:57.000347,Johana,not sure really. i haven’t used RQ to that capacity but i would assume so b/c all the workers need is a copy of the source code they can access.
1801,2017-12-20T17:49:13.000342,Johana,the same goes for celery
1801,2017-12-20T17:50:24.000266,Bruno,yea. that was my thought
1801,2017-12-20T17:50:55.000097,Bruno,i just spin up workers based on need or load. and they have thecode. and just look to see what work needs to be done.
1801,2017-12-20T17:50:58.000166,Johana,as long as they can all talk to the same broker it should work.
1801,2017-12-20T17:51:17.000070,Bruno,what about failover. if the queue container breaks or fails. how is that handled?
1801,2017-12-20T17:51:23.000028,Bruno,ok.
1801,2017-12-20T17:51:38.000015,Johana,you get a bunch of rabbitmq errors.
1801,2017-12-20T17:51:41.000013,Bruno,"ah, or i suppose what if the broker fails."
1801,2017-12-20T17:51:43.000309,Bruno,ok.
1801,2017-12-20T17:51:53.000378,Bruno,we want to prevent lost jobs
1801,2017-12-20T17:51:58.000081,Bruno,"well, we have to"
1801,2017-12-20T17:52:07.000408,Johana,you can have celery retry a task a number of times.
1801,2017-12-20T17:52:20.000216,Johana,if it keeps failing you can setup a dead-mailbox or something like that.
1801,2017-12-20T17:52:43.000233,Johana,you can also have celery send an email.
1801,2017-12-20T17:52:44.000010,Bruno,"well, i mean if celery goes down. or, in this case, redis since its the backend store"
1801,2017-12-20T17:53:04.000001,Bruno,hmm
1801,2017-12-20T17:53:27.000137,Bruno,"i suppose if it goes down, we can re-run the main worker to rebuild the queue."
1801,2017-12-20T17:53:53.000373,Johana,o wait n/m dead-letter queue is rabbitmq specific.
1801,2017-12-20T17:54:04.000120,Bruno,its a finite amount of work (that would get larger as we get more users) but its that they are long running.
1801,2017-12-20T17:55:09.000334,Johana,"i got you. celery has what are known as signatures, chains, and groups, you can use these to execute your tasks in particular ways."
1801,2017-12-20T17:55:28.000463,Johana,a chain for example will execute tasks in order and only when the first one completes.
1801,2017-12-20T17:56:02.000125,Bruno,ok. thats nice.
1801,2017-12-20T17:56:42.000430,Johana,for monitoring: <http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/monitoring.html>
1801,2017-12-20T17:56:54.000239,Johana,flower is pretty sweet.
1801,2017-12-20T17:57:14.000190,Bruno,but what im thinking about. is the storage of the queue. in redis. what if redis goes down. For this case i would assume that the redis data has to be persisted onto a data volume or s3? or something. so if it goes down it can be restarted and get the data back. or we could possibly re-build the queue
1801,2017-12-20T17:57:25.000281,Bruno,ok ill check it out thanks.
1801,2017-12-20T17:57:45.000059,Johana,"yea, you would need to run a persistent redis."
1801,2017-12-20T17:57:49.000196,Bruno,i just havent done this much yet for deploying all this.
1801,2017-12-20T17:58:16.000301,Bruno,would it save data to s3 or just a mounted volume or something?
1801,2017-12-20T17:58:54.000300,Johana,i think redis has its own thing
1801,2017-12-20T17:59:02.000558,Bruno,were not using docker yet. well we are but only for a small service. im onw of the few that is trying to help and bring docker in by getting small things running in it.
1801,2017-12-20T17:59:06.000437,Bruno,ok.
1801,2017-12-20T17:59:19.000071,Johana,yea it’s called RDB. <https://redis.io/topics/persistence>
1801,2017-12-20T17:59:44.000421,Bruno,ok. basically we cant afford to lose data.
1801,2017-12-20T18:00:02.000586,Johana,"yea, says the RDB can be stored on amazon s3"
1801,2017-12-20T18:00:22.000037,Bruno,this is all done every day. so backup would only need to be done for the current or last day.
1801,2017-12-20T18:00:53.000152,Bruno,"main thing, is if it fails for whatever reason. when we bring it up we want to continue from where we left off."
1801,2017-12-20T18:01:10.000087,Bruno,&gt; RDB is NOT good if you need to minimize the chance of data loss in case Redis stops working (for example after a power outage)
1801,2017-12-20T18:01:47.000292,Bruno,what we store in redis shouldnt be too large.
1801,2017-12-20T18:03:36.000012,Bruno,"ok, i think the AoF part is more what im looking for."
1801,2017-12-20T18:04:04.000235,Johana,is the current thing not working well?
1801,2017-12-20T18:04:47.000351,Bruno,"but, it may not be too big of a deal. the list of all work can be built in a couple minutes probably. so if redis goes down. we can probably just rebuild it."
1801,2017-12-20T18:05:07.000291,Bruno,"it is working, but its really messy. its basically a small monolith."
1801,2017-12-20T18:05:57.000138,Bruno,"its all done in 1 big thread managed in code. and spawns process threads (up to 10) to actually process the work. and its hard to debug. and right now, im debugging a race condition."
1801,2017-12-20T18:07:49.000317,Bruno,"so when we have clients thats using this to monitor $1b worth of work reports, we want ti to be stable and easy to work on."
1802,2017-12-20T19:52:03.000319,Marlon,I have a module with a `def main():` block i’m trying to call this module from another file using the context trick (<https://github.com/kennethreitz/samplemod/blob/master/tests/context.py>) in my tests folder i’m trying to say module.main() and it’s telling me it’s not callable. any pointers?
1803,2017-12-20T20:57:25.000244,Myong,"Hey guys im attempting to setup a notification system for reddit.

1803,2017-12-20T20:59:55.000036,Myong,Would something like a many to many relationship be a good idea between a user and an item?
1803,2017-12-21T02:47:56.000090,Ciera,many to many seems find to me

1804,2017-12-21T04:38:14.000045,Ciera,it depends how many boilerplate strings you want to test

1804,2017-12-21T09:29:53.000661,Corrinne,Regex?
1804,2017-12-21T09:30:56.000596,Corrinne,Will be easy if the string is always formatted in the same way
1804,2017-12-21T09:30:59.000083,Ciera,you can find the index of `WK` in the string and replace that and the 2 next letters
1804,2017-12-21T09:31:06.000482,Ozie,`/(WK\d\d)/`
1804,2017-12-21T09:31:08.000274,Ciera,but yeah regex :thumbsup:

1804,2017-12-21T09:38:58.000277,Krysta,Works wonders thanks guys
1804,2017-12-21T09:41:56.000450,Ciera,<@Marlon> don't be afraid of that. You will probably laugh at your own code a few years/month from now.
1804,2017-12-21T09:42:08.000398,Ciera,it means you have improved
1804,2017-12-21T09:43:15.000244,Ciera,just remember to use the testing pypy while your are trying stuff :slightly_smiling_face:
1804,2017-12-21T09:43:36.000330,Marlon,"Ha, i’ve been laughing at my code for years"
1804,2017-12-21T09:43:43.000183,Marlon,i guess that means i’m learning
1804,2017-12-21T09:47:41.000385,Marlon,"so the project takes a jinja template, and an yaml input file and uses the values from the input file to template out the yaml file. it will also allow undefined variables, and reading from environment. i took a lot of inspiration from `envtpl` and `jinja2cli`"

1804,2017-12-21T09:48:05.000591,Marlon,and i hate it
1804,2017-12-21T09:50:11.000331,Ciera,well I suppose it's at least useful to you if you created it and it's always new stuff to learn
1804,2017-12-21T09:50:29.000764,Ciera,I'm also very bad at naming things so can't hep you

1804,2017-12-21T10:02:23.000027,Marlon,i actually really like that
1804,2017-12-21T10:02:31.000406,Marlon,most of the other tools won’t do yaml either

1806,2017-12-21T10:04:21.000695,Johana,yajinja or yaninja?
1806,2017-12-21T10:04:24.000045,Johana,lol
1806,2017-12-21T10:06:29.000592,Johana,that should be on the README :point_up:
1806,2017-12-21T10:07:48.000189,Marlon,haha. very good.
1806,2017-12-21T10:08:01.000130,Marlon,i’m not sure yet. i’m leaning towards yajinja

1807,2017-12-21T10:49:53.000722,Stacy,"Nice I was doing with only if and while, for is much better."
1807,2017-12-21T10:50:19.000282,Stacy,Thanks I knew it would be something simple I was not thinking of
1807,2017-12-21T10:54:23.000321,Suellen,"it's just a template, I presume the actual format is somewhat different"
1807,2017-12-21T11:25:32.000221,Stacy,Yes but dropping in the for lets me iterate through as I need.
1808,2017-12-21T11:57:04.000344,Seema,"Sigh...
```pip3 install -e ./

So there's an option for that???  Okay, good because this is 3.6+

1808,2017-12-21T12:01:04.000426,Ciera,what are you trying to do ?
1808,2017-12-21T12:01:34.000570,Seema,install dataclasses.py (cloned from git repo) into my 3.6 install

It is alright if it takes up the entire site as I can just style the forum site to look like the other, but I would prefer it didn't since I would want to have user login info shared between the main site and the forum. 

Or would you recommend I jut build one myself (general forums should function similar to a multi-user blog which I feel confident in my ability to build). Either way I will still have a contact form, so I might not even need a forum but I still wanna look into it"
1809,2017-12-21T15:05:28.000042,Frieda,github issues?
1809,2017-12-21T15:07:29.000431,Vita,It would mainly be for the non tech person so they probably won't be familiar with github (although I totally forgot about github for things like this)
1809,2017-12-21T15:08:00.000276,Frieda,trello? jira :shudder:?

1809,2017-12-21T15:09:38.000221,Vita,I like Jira but the budget will probably say no

1809,2017-12-21T15:10:34.000539,Frieda,"yeah, github projects will _sorta_ replace Trello"
1809,2017-12-21T15:10:41.000104,Frieda,but Trello is way friendlier for non-tech people
1809,2017-12-21T15:11:00.000324,Suellen,hm.. I always thought of them as the same practically
1809,2017-12-21T15:11:08.000468,Suellen,not really great either of them
1809,2017-12-21T15:12:06.000116,Frieda,"oh, trello is great"
1809,2017-12-21T15:13:21.000582,Vita,"Alright I shall look into those two and trying to connect or use them via an api with the site then. And yea, I have used trello before and it rocked, just never thought of using it as a forum on another site"
1809,2017-12-21T15:14:46.000270,Frieda,i probably wouldn't go that route but that's just me

1810,2017-12-21T16:25:52.000577,Ozie,small application with small # of users? sounds like you're already avoiding too many queries
1810,2017-12-21T16:27:36.000122,Myong,Simple enough

1811,2017-12-21T20:24:00.000024,Susann,79 characters
1811,2017-12-21T20:24:46.000056,Susann,"that's just a joke on PEP-8, not sure what you mean <@Bette>"
1811,2017-12-21T20:25:07.000099,Susann,do you mean the number of characters in a string?
1811,2017-12-21T20:25:12.000087,Bette,No

1811,2017-12-21T20:25:33.000178,Bette,Is there any restriction?
1811,2017-12-21T20:26:08.000177,Susann,This SO article indicates there isn't one but I wouldn't be surprised if some implementations added restrictions <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16920835/what-is-the-maximum-length-for-an-attribute-name-in-python>
1811,2017-12-21T20:26:10.000137,Bette,I read that there is no restriction and it can be any reasonable length
1811,2017-12-21T20:26:20.000117,Susann,yep :point_up: that's what I read
1811,2017-12-21T20:26:44.000199,Bette,It's like unlimited :grin:
1811,2017-12-21T20:26:53.000020,Susann,"""unlimited"" :stuck_out_tongue:"
1811,2017-12-21T20:31:04.000176,Bette,I have also tested a variable name with length 80
1811,2017-12-21T20:31:12.000023,Bette,I didn't get any errors

1811,2017-12-21T20:34:04.000042,Susann,haha the 79 character limit is actually just in the style guideline
1811,2017-12-21T20:34:29.000065,Susann,nothing in the language enforces that

1811,2017-12-21T20:35:50.000005,Corrinne,You'll have trouble using `for` and `2good` as variable names though
1811,2017-12-21T20:37:02.000110,Susann,yep `for` is a reserved identifier because it's used for `for` loops

1811,2017-12-21T20:37:17.000134,Susann,and I believe the `2good` is unusable because it starts with a number
1811,2017-12-21T20:37:59.000136,Susann,which Python prevents

The `with picamera.PiCamera() as camera:` block is written to close down the `with` block when the process is complete, you could use a `while True:` block to keep the program alive though that is rough as it does not have a condition for closure."
1817,2017-12-23T16:16:28.000006,Deedee,"<@Marco> Because the script is already importing `time`, you could just follow same convention that most other camera software use: timestamp in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format.

Change line
`camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/image1.jpg', use_video_port=True)`
To something like
```
datetime_captured = time.strftime(""%Y%m%d%H%M%S"")
camera.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/' + datetime_captured + '.jpg', use_video_port=True)
```
The above will produce file w/ name like `20171223140944.jpg` in `/home/pi/Desktop/`.

As for having software run until explicitly exiting, something along the lines of what <@Seema> suggested is way to go."

He is working on a camera built with a Raspberry Pi and Python for taking picture of a retina. The problem is that the code he has always saves the picture with the same name.  Thus, if you take a picture, it writes over the previous picture.  It should instead save each picture with a new name.  Also, at the end the script shuts down the camera, rather than letting you take multiple pictures without restarting the program.  Below is the code.  How can I change it to fix these problems?  If I should post this somewhere else, please let me know.  Thanks.

1829,2017-12-25T12:52:43.000055,Arlene,I see this
1829,2017-12-25T12:52:56.000047,Meg,probably because the value is a string and not `None`
1829,2017-12-25T12:53:01.000001,Arlene,"i know, thats why id like to convert it to `null`"

1829,2017-12-25T12:56:19.000047,Arlene,its a string
1829,2017-12-25T12:57:13.000045,Meg,that’s why

1830,2017-12-26T07:14:59.000108,Bette,Also I couldn't able to understand the method any in tuple
1830,2017-12-26T07:18:39.000008,Junita,"Python 3 does not allow that either - there are two issues - one you are trying to assign to an integer literal, and two variables cannot begin with numbers"
1830,2017-12-26T07:19:47.000059,Junita,"I don’t know what the environment is that seemed to allow it, but it’s incorrect behavior to allow it"
1830,2017-12-26T07:21:13.000002,Bette,Hi jkelly
1830,2017-12-26T07:21:42.000021,Bette,I am trying it from a python 3.6 in a website
1830,2017-12-26T07:21:57.000038,Bette,It works there and it's not working in 2.7
1830,2017-12-26T07:22:15.000120,Junita,"I would stop using this website then, it’s not using a true python interpreter"
1830,2017-12-26T07:22:32.000118,Junita,what website is it?
1830,2017-12-26T07:22:42.000087,Bette,Python <http://tutor.com|tutor.com>
1830,2017-12-26T07:23:04.000006,Bette,I got your point regarding variable rule
1830,2017-12-26T07:23:22.000108,Junita,yeah perhaps they are doing something weird with the variables before passing them to an underlying interpreter.
1830,2017-12-26T07:23:23.000039,Bette,Do you know about python any method
1830,2017-12-26T07:23:42.000089,Bette,I'm scartaching my head to understand it
1830,2017-12-26T07:23:51.000110,Junita,"yes, essentially it ensures that at least one value in an iterable evaluates to `True`"
1830,2017-12-26T07:24:14.000144,Junita,"a related method is `all`, which assures that all values evaluate to `True`"
1830,2017-12-26T07:25:34.000117,Bette,Yeah. Read it but in the example
1830,2017-12-26T07:25:55.000086,Bette,"The output is 
True false true false"
1830,2017-12-26T07:26:02.000027,Bette,I'm wondering how
1830,2017-12-26T07:26:14.000042,Junita,"it’s basically the same as a function that is like this:

```
def any(iter):
    for item in iter:
        if item:
            return True
    return False
```"
1830,2017-12-26T07:27:13.000014,Bette,It would be nice if you can explain me the output of above code
1830,2017-12-26T07:27:31.000026,Junita,"the reason is python has a concept of “truthiness” - essentially values like 0, None and False all are roughly equivalent in boolean comparison"
1830,2017-12-26T07:27:31.000135,Bette,Like how it was true or false
1830,2017-12-26T07:28:01.000009,Junita,"and non-zero integers, non-empty strings, etc. and of course True are all True"
1830,2017-12-26T07:29:41.000052,Bette,But in case 1 and 3 0 is there and still return true ?
1830,2017-12-26T07:29:54.000014,Bette,Because we need atleast one true ?
1830,2017-12-26T07:29:58.000029,Bette,Am I right ?
1830,2017-12-26T07:29:58.000076,Junita,exactly
1830,2017-12-26T07:30:11.000150,Junita,"if *any* value is true, then it returns true"
1830,2017-12-26T07:30:23.000066,Bette,Got it mate :grin: 
1830,2017-12-26T07:30:30.000144,Bette,Thanks for explaining
1830,2017-12-26T07:30:34.000074,Junita,No problem
1830,2017-12-26T07:30:44.000177,Junita,"at least for me, it’s not something I use often, except when writing tests"
1830,2017-12-26T07:36:49.000030,Bette,Hehe I have been learning Python so making notes of these methods with examples:wink: 
1830,2017-12-26T07:38:32.000034,Junita,that’s always a good idea.  are you by chance going through the list here? <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html>
1830,2017-12-26T07:52:19.000175,Bette,No mate
1830,2017-12-26T07:53:20.000040,Bette,There is a site called <http://programiz.com|programiz.com> which is containing all most all methods for string tuple set dictionary list in a plain and simple manner
1831,2017-12-26T10:10:50.000005,Glinda,"How would I write a unit test for this decorator function? ```def validate_response(json_key, expected_value):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            data = json.loads(request.form['payload'])[json_key]
            if data is not expected_value:
                return redirect(url_for('HTTP403'))

            return func(data, *args, **kwargs)

        return wrapper

    return decorator```"
1831,2017-12-26T10:12:14.000090,Glinda,I'd have to mock both `redirect` and `json.loads`
1831,2017-12-26T10:15:53.000127,Suellen,Why mock redirect?
1831,2017-12-26T10:16:13.000189,Suellen,"You could check a return value, which is probably a response object with a correct status code and `location`"
1832,2017-12-26T10:35:47.000261,Glenda,hey guys! wondering if someone could help me out with performing a regex replace
1832,2017-12-26T10:36:22.000002,Glenda,I am trying to do a case insensitive search and insert &lt;b&gt; html tag before and &lt;/b&gt; html tag after every match
1832,2017-12-26T10:37:18.000197,Glenda,right now I have code which does that but the problem is it replaces the actual word with the case of the search word instead of keeping the case in each scenario
1832,2017-12-26T10:39:10.000084,Glenda,"content = ""Test tEst TEsT""
pattern = re.compile(""test"", re.IGNORECASE)
content = pattern.sub(""&lt;b&gt;{0}&lt;/b&gt;"".format(word), content)
#returns ""&lt;b&gt;test&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;test&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;test&lt;/b&gt;""
#want ""&lt;b&gt;Test&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;tEst&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;TEsT&lt;/b&gt;"""
1832,2017-12-26T10:40:49.000013,Glinda,<https://regexr.com/>
1832,2017-12-26T10:40:52.000108,Glinda,Have you used this before?
1832,2017-12-26T10:41:09.000054,Glinda,Actually this one is better
1832,2017-12-26T10:41:10.000079,Glinda,<https://regex101.com/>
1832,2017-12-26T10:41:27.000181,Glenda,hahaha yes i've gotten a lot of use out of those regex builders :slightly_smiling_face:
1832,2017-12-26T10:41:50.000047,Glinda,So your problem
1832,2017-12-26T10:41:59.000235,Glinda,there's a cerrtain word you want that is case insensitive
1832,2017-12-26T10:42:24.000147,Glinda,if you find such pattern  `.....{pattern}...`
1832,2017-12-26T10:42:27.000240,Glinda,you want to replace with
1832,2017-12-26T10:42:39.000199,Glinda,`.....&lt;b&gt;{pattern}&lt;/b&gt;...`
1832,2017-12-26T10:42:57.000134,Glenda,right
1832,2017-12-26T10:43:08.000041,Glenda,but I don't want to replace {pattern}
1832,2017-12-26T10:43:16.000004,Glenda,which is what my code does right now
1832,2017-12-26T10:43:29.000058,Glinda,regex is fine
1832,2017-12-26T10:43:49.000077,Glinda,if you want an easy way
1832,2017-12-26T10:45:06.000220,Glinda,"```def string_match(input, compare):
    lower_case = input.lower()
    compare_lower = compare.lower()```"
1832,2017-12-26T10:45:13.000087,Glinda,First conver to lowercase for both
1832,2017-12-26T10:45:46.000115,Glinda,Then use string methods to find all matches.
1832,2017-12-26T10:46:19.000023,Glinda,Use the found location indices
1832,2017-12-26T10:46:29.000120,Glenda,right I was thinking that...
1832,2017-12-26T10:46:39.000112,Glenda,would regex be cleaner though?
1832,2017-12-26T10:46:40.000190,Glinda,"Now you might ask, well isn't it slow to remake a string?"
1832,2017-12-26T10:47:00.000252,Glinda,It really depends
1832,2017-12-26T10:47:46.000227,Glinda,So if you know of that solution. Let's work on the regex one.
1832,2017-12-26T10:48:22.000228,Glinda,"```content = ""Test tEst TEsT""
pattern = re.compile(""test"", re.IGNORECASE)
content = pattern.sub(""&lt;b&gt;{0}&lt;/b&gt;"".format(word), content)
#returns ""&lt;b&gt;test&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;test&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;test&lt;/b&gt;""
#want ""&lt;b&gt;Test&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;tEst&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;TEsT&lt;/b&gt;""```"
1832,2017-12-26T10:49:12.000021,Glinda,You should probably use
1832,2017-12-26T10:49:18.000167,Glinda,groups instead of string formatting
1832,2017-12-26T10:49:58.000180,Glinda,"```method = 'images/:id/huge'
re.sub(r'(:[a-z]+)', r'&lt;span&gt;\1&lt;/span&gt;', method)

'images/&lt;span&gt;:id&lt;/span&gt;/huge'```"
1832,2017-12-26T10:50:42.000035,Glenda,ahhhh
1832,2017-12-26T10:50:53.000132,Glenda,yes that's what I am looking for :slightly_smiling_face:
1832,2017-12-26T10:51:16.000036,Glinda,btw
1832,2017-12-26T10:51:29.000085,Glinda,I recently found out about python named group regex matching

1837,2017-12-27T00:42:59.000117,Ryann,I then pass the keyword to a python script

1837,2017-12-27T00:44:15.000127,Ryann,My question is how do pass I the updated django model to a function in a script
1837,2017-12-27T00:45:14.000030,Ryann,Also the keyword argument that is passed is going to be making a change in a object

1837,2017-12-27T00:49:25.000043,Ryann,And the script is something like this
1837,2017-12-27T00:49:45.000070,Ryann,"def main(client, ad_group_id, keyword):
  # Initialize appropriate service.
  ad_group_criterion_service = client.GetService(

  keyword1 = {

1837,2017-12-27T00:54:02.000066,Collette,"But you pass the new keyword already to the main function, no?"
1837,2017-12-27T00:54:15.000084,Collette,I see now you simply don't use that parameter at all
1837,2017-12-27T00:55:47.000013,Ryann,Yes my question is how do i use the parameter to update the keywrod1 text

1837,2017-12-27T01:01:07.000047,Ryann,Do i still have to iterate
1837,2017-12-27T01:06:46.000067,Collette,<@Ryann> then you shouldn't do `Keyword.objects.all()`
1837,2017-12-27T01:16:11.000027,Collette,Sounds scary
1837,2017-12-27T01:17:09.000147,Collette,I'm not sure why would you need an environment variable if you already have a .yaml file. Can't you define a variable's value within that .yaml file as well?
1837,2017-12-27T01:35:12.000115,Johnsie,"Man, the tool read entire file, but the isolated script not"

1842,2017-12-27T08:06:25.000041,Bette,Hi guys can someone explain me whats the difference between
1842,2017-12-27T08:07:06.000094,Bette,new_list=list vs new_list=list[:]
1842,2017-12-27T08:07:59.000144,Bette,"As per my understanding the values of list is assigned to new_list,but what is the [:] means here ?"
1842,2017-12-27T08:09:25.000243,Ciera,"it's a very bad idea to name one of your variables `list`, `dict` , `str`"
1842,2017-12-27T08:10:38.000066,Junita,"what <@Ciera> said.  To your specific question, new_list = list means they point at the same underlying data, where as `list[:]` copies the contents of `list`"

1842,2017-12-27T08:18:32.000274,Junita,"yeah like I mentioned yesterday, I think you should stop using that site.  :confused:"
1842,2017-12-27T08:23:04.000104,Dinah,"they do seem to have nice illustrations of your program. could be good for beginners. But yeah, sites that have bad example code should be banned"
1842,2017-12-27T08:26:02.000032,Junita,yesterday it also seemed to allow invalid syntax
1842,2017-12-27T08:26:25.000284,Junita,I feel kind of bad recommending not to use something without a good alternative though.  :confused:
1842,2017-12-27T08:27:30.000009,Dinah,"still, nothing is worse the giving a developer bad habits (not to mention wrong habits...)"

1842,2017-12-27T08:29:57.000077,Junita,"Yeah, certainly at least in the case of yesterday it actively caused some confusion, and yeah using builtins as variable names is definitely something to be avoided."
1842,2017-12-27T08:34:21.000053,Eugenie,"With new_list = list, you don't actually have two lists. The assignment just copies the reference to the list, not the actual list, so both new_list and list refer to the same list after the assignment."
1842,2017-12-27T08:36:13.000008,Eugenie,Where as new_list=list[:] you can actually slice it but is a weird syntax and dosen't make any sense.

1845,2017-12-27T10:37:02.000514,Glinda,list is a function meant to convert some iterable object to a list. By using list as a variable name you're overriding this function which leads to bad things.

1861,2017-12-29T08:05:59.000094,Regina,"I wondered, why it was behaving like this."
1862,2017-12-29T08:48:53.000014,Georgeann,"Hi all.
I have a Dockerfile. I run the command docker build. Then docker run.
My script creates a file, how to make so that it is stored on my PC, because if I the script will run using Docker, it is nowhere to be found."
1862,2017-12-29T09:32:31.000143,Deedee,<@Georgeann> have you checked for the file inside of the container?
1862,2017-12-29T09:35:59.000136,Elma,after you've checked if the file exists inside of the container you should use docker-compose 'volumes' <https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#volumes>
1862,2017-12-29T09:39:38.000087,Deedee,"Agreed.
But also depends on what no-name wants to do. I didn't get much other than script creates a file that can't be found. Apparently should be written in host OS."
1862,2017-12-29T09:51:09.000042,Elma,mmm you're right.
1862,2017-12-29T10:10:59.000213,Georgeann,"<@Elma> <@Deedee> Look.
I have a pythonscript for example look like
```f = open('some.txt', 'w')
f.wrtite('Test')
f.close()
```
and i build docker, like
```$ docker build -t test/test1 .
```
then
```
$ docker run --rm idonotknowwhat
```
And what should I add to start to the file to appear in the same folder where I run the script?"
1862,2017-12-29T10:20:54.000270,Elma,To share files between client and container you can create volumes
1862,2017-12-29T10:21:10.000351,Elma,You should take a look on this <http://jdlm.info/articles/2016/03/06/lessons-building-node-app-docker.html#the-nodemodules-volume-trick>
1862,2017-12-29T10:21:44.000071,Elma,or check in the official documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/#choose-the--v-or-mount-flag>
1862,2017-12-29T10:24:20.000351,Georgeann,"I looked at the official documentation and i run script like 
```
$ docker run --rm -v /home/cat/Documents/projects/mypr/my2pr:/home test/test1
```
And I still received the error."
1862,2017-12-29T10:24:35.000136,Georgeann,Too hard :smiley:
1862,2017-12-29T10:51:06.000309,Elma,are you setted the WORKDIR in your dockerfile ?
1862,2017-12-29T11:31:29.000214,Georgeann,Nope 
1862,2017-12-29T12:49:56.000142,Suellen,closure?
1862,2017-12-29T12:50:04.000214,Suellen,binding?
1863,2017-12-29T11:24:40.000068,Glinda,"<@Johnsie> Best practice: anything that needs to be unique among instances needs to be in `__init__` or an instance variable anything that needs to be shared among instances needs to be a class variable. Code to the behavior here, don't code to the variable type."
1863,2017-12-29T12:04:09.000174,Johnsie,"<@Glinda>, ok thanks. You last phrase make senses a lot. ""Code to the behavior""."
1863,2017-12-29T12:46:16.000169,Glinda,"What is this behavior called: ```from src.modules import Module

# Instance the class and save a variable in this package. 
Module(important_variable)

# classmethod, that can reference 'important_variable'
# only if called after the above call
ModuleHelper.function('some string')```"
1863,2017-12-29T12:50:45.000224,Glinda,That sounds right.
1863,2017-12-29T12:56:16.000329,Glinda,"How bad of an idea is this: ```token = None

class Module:
    def __init__(self, variable):
        global token 
        token = variable
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(token)
    Module('test')
    print(token)
    ```"
1863,2017-12-29T12:56:42.000293,Ciera,what's the goal ?
1863,2017-12-29T12:57:27.000147,Glinda,"I have a few classes in this module, all of them need access to this token."
1863,2017-12-29T12:57:38.000065,Glinda,I want to make the module as much like a package as I can
1863,2017-12-29T12:58:07.000152,Glinda,where you have to pass in a token instead of looking for one in the local area or define it within the package.
1863,2017-12-29T12:59:40.000145,Ciera,you can create a variable inside a package
1863,2017-12-29T13:00:20.000352,Ciera,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(requests)
&lt;module 'requests' from '/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/requests/__init__.py'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; requests.hello = 'world'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(requests.hello)
world
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
```"
1863,2017-12-29T13:00:33.000247,Ciera,I believe something like this should work
1863,2017-12-29T13:01:02.000141,Glinda,Okay that sounds good.
1863,2017-12-29T13:03:19.000291,Devorah,"I'm trying to scrape data from wunderground with requests and its working but eventually after about 8 or so requests it gives me an exception, is there an easy way to tell requests to keep trying? not seeing anything after a few quick searches"

1863,2017-12-29T13:04:31.000058,Meg,what’s the exception you’re getting?
1863,2017-12-29T13:05:00.000203,Meg,"sounds like you’re on the developer plan, which limits you to 10 calls/minute and 500 calls/day"
1863,2017-12-29T13:10:10.000047,Meg,"but given the number of requests you’re making, sounds like you’re hitting the limit per minute"
1863,2017-12-29T13:10:22.000101,Glinda,"Yeah, and they should be returning a status response."
1863,2017-12-29T13:10:30.000288,Glinda,But it's easier to ignore I guess.

1863,2017-12-29T13:17:28.000160,Devorah,I did have it every 30 seconds and it would do it as well too
1863,2017-12-29T13:24:40.000357,Meg,What you should do for the responses is check if there's an error section. Scroll down that link I posted above with a sample response with an error 
1863,2017-12-29T13:25:10.000335,Meg,"And implement some try catches, exception handling and response code checks"

1866,2017-12-29T17:59:37.000009,Ciera,thanks :thumbsup:
1866,2017-12-29T17:59:43.000054,Ciera,good work on the website :wink:
1866,2017-12-29T18:00:35.000064,Deedee,no man. thank you!
1866,2017-12-29T18:02:46.000237,Meg,you learn somthing every day
1866,2017-12-29T18:03:16.000027,Meg,and git (or whatever VCS) is one of those things you do need to be comfortable with especially if you’re on a team
1866,2017-12-29T18:08:55.000084,Ciera,take care to create a new branch before doing any modifications
1866,2017-12-29T18:13:14.000079,Deedee,"yeah. I've been after this for a couple of days. tried reset, just hadn't used `--hard`. anyway, you guys are awesome."
1866,2017-12-30T04:54:39.000025,Georgeann,Today I will try. Thanks. 
1867,2017-12-29T16:05:21.000293,Deedee,"Moved this in here b/c channel has taken another direction.

`docker run --rm -v /home/cat/Documents/projects/mypr/my2pr:/home test/test1`

`--rm` removes the container when it stops/exits. My guess is that any mapped volumes disappear as well. Do you have this issue if you DON'T use `--rm`?"
1867,2017-12-29T17:43:13.000089,Deedee,"I need help. I've read so many posts/responses/articles... even watched 2 hrs worth of vids on LinuxAcademy on Git that things like <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing> may as well be written as hieroglyphs.
What I need to do is replace my local repo w/ the most recent upstream. So sync my local copy so that it is exactly as the latest upstream/master copy.
fetch, rebase, pull, merge, sorcery, it all just produces errors. 
```
error: Failed to merge in the changes.
Patch failed at 0001 Rewording of copy on invite request form
The copy of the patch that failed is found in: .git/rebase-apply/patch

When you have resolved this problem, run ""git rebase --continue"".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run ""git rebase --skip"" instead.
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run ""git rebase --abort"".
```

1868,2017-12-29T20:52:58.000025,Kayce,Does anyone know of a good project structure for a sanic application?
1868,2017-12-29T20:54:26.000044,Kayce,I'm thinking about doing a straight copy of whatever flask would do.
1868,2017-12-30T13:57:08.000067,Kayce,"New question, how does everyone here use pytest for REST apis?

I ask because I have things such as test_update_user that needs me to

- Setup a test user in the database via `post(/api/user, data=new_user_data)`
- Perform test on user update via `put(/api/user/&lt;username&gt;, data=updated_user_data) `
- Teardown the test user via `delete(/api/user/&lt;username&gt;)`

I don't really know how to consolidate the Setup and Teardown aspects of this into a fixture."
1869,2017-12-30T15:05:30.000060,Seema,this might be overkill and I honestly haven't used it but I heard about this on pybyes podcast <https://taverntesting.github.io/>
1869,2017-12-30T15:05:43.000023,Seema,<https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/52/call-your-apis-with-uplink-and-test-them-in-the-tavern>
1870,2017-12-30T23:07:03.000005,Ute,"Hello. I'm new to python and am a bit puzzled about using virtualenv and was wondering what the current best practices are surrounding that, especially for beginners"
1870,2017-12-30T23:22:48.000067,Seema,"<@Sherley> I'm being a *bit* simplistic but the norm is virtualenv for everything.  If you use more than one version of Python, it becomes very handy, especially when you start using the switches/options."
1870,2017-12-30T23:24:35.000002,Ute,<@Seema> has virtualenv been phased out in favor of docker?
1870,2017-12-30T23:25:00.000017,Collette,"<@Sherley> I'd say start with `pipenv`. It has its quirks, but for an end-user it works better than just plain virtualenv"
1870,2017-12-30T23:25:01.000004,Ute,Or is it still accepted to use virtualenv
1870,2017-12-30T23:25:10.000051,Collette,docker is a whole different story
1870,2017-12-30T23:25:47.000039,Seema,"Depending on your philosophy and desires, you can use both together or just a virtualenv.  They are not the same though can accomplish similar tasks"
1870,2017-12-30T23:25:56.000030,Ute,"From what I understand, the point of virtualenv is to keep each project and its dependencies isolated"
1870,2017-12-30T23:26:30.000073,Ute,Which incidentally also coincides with my understanding of docker's purpose.. Or at least its central one
1870,2017-12-30T23:30:23.000062,Seema,"Docker creates composable environments while virtualenv creates a virtual environment, installing to a virtualenv is isolated from the system but available after deactivation.  Docker images are created, calling the same image next time will create the original environment"
1870,2017-12-30T23:30:59.000068,Seema,There are other advantages and disadvantages.  Are you developing for yourself?
1870,2017-12-30T23:34:37.000035,Seema,"The pros often come down to how you want to manage dependencies, system files, and whether you are sharing the environment.  Virtualenv really does take care of the majority of the issues in a simpler fashion"
1870,2017-12-30T23:38:15.000039,Seema,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe>
1870,2017-12-30T23:48:33.000027,Ute,<@Seema> The project that I was interested in is an open source project I found on GitHub
1870,2017-12-30T23:49:38.000045,Seema,The project will typically have a lead either by including a docker file or a requirements. Txt or possibly even both
1870,2017-12-30T23:50:25.000015,Seema,"I would follow the project in that case, ymmv"
1870,2017-12-30T23:54:42.000007,Ute,"Ok. It recommends virtualenv but is missing explicit directions on how to use it in the readme, <http://GitHub.com/hackforla/adopt-civic-art|GitHub.com/hackforla/adopt-civic-art>"
1870,2017-12-31T00:00:55.000009,Seema,"Like Malinoff said, you can use other virtualenv, either way, you'll create an environment, clone the repo, then pip install -r requirements.txt"
1870,2017-12-31T00:01:18.000021,Seema,The command will change depending on the program of course
1870,2017-12-31T00:02:05.000022,Seema,"(Off for the night, gn, good luck)"
1870,2017-12-31T00:55:26.000040,Ute,Thanks
