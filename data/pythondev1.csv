a = 400
s = '0.%02sem' % str(a)[:-1]

print(s)  # actual outcome  // 0.40em
print('0.40em')  # expected outcome  / 0.40em

2,2018-12-31T05:51:15.728000,Raven,Leading zeros is something you apply to numbers rather than to strings. You're lucky that the first example works because it doesn't need any leading zeros.

4,2019-01-01T05:33:04.744700,Conchita,How do I access the same function and when placed inside my class?
4,2019-01-01T05:34:39.746000,Conchita,What I want is to write a print statement outside my class. I tried this one with no success `print(Skye.address_lookup('1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx'))`
4,2019-01-01T05:36:51.746500,Conchita,The traceback I get is ```TypeError: address_lookup() missing 1 required positional argument: 'address'```
4,2019-01-01T05:38:38.748100,Raven,A class is like a set of instructions for making an object. See line 4 - that's an example of you using the MongoClient class to create an 'instance' of MongoClient. Then you can perform actions on that instance. You need to do the same for your class.
4,2019-01-01T05:39:20.748800,Raven,"(What you have currently is an attempt to call the function directly on the class itself, which is almost never what you want. Sadly Python's error message for this is not as clear as it could be.)"
4,2019-01-01T05:39:59.749300,Raven,"Finally, note that the `address_lookup` function will not need to take an `address` argument"
4,2019-01-01T05:45:57.751600,Conchita,"Ok, so first I need to create an instance like ```a = Skye('1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx' 1203, 0.3)``` then ```a.address_lookup('1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx')``` ?"

4,2019-01-01T05:49:22.752900,Raven,Looks reasonable to me
4,2019-01-01T05:51:42.754900,Conchita,"Great, thanks for the explanation! This is probably a stupid question, but here goes. Would it be possible to create an instance like you showed me here, without providing all arguments I have included in the `def __init__` ? Could i do ```a = Skye('1HQ3Go3ggs8pFnXuHVHRytPCq5fGG8Hbhx')```?"
4,2019-01-01T05:52:06.755100,Raven,You could give those arguments default values
4,2019-01-01T05:53:34.755500,Conchita,like this?

20,2019-01-02T08:39:24.851600,Jimmy,<@Conchita> `datetime` object are specific python object and `bson` can't translate it to a type that can be saved into mongo. I have no idea if mongo support any kind of datetime format. One solution might be to store the timestamp as an int in the database and format it back into a datetime object when you read it
20,2019-01-02T08:41:11.852600,Conchita,I'll just store it as an int for now

24,2019-01-02T09:46:17.859800,Asha,"Then you just Google everything you don't know how to do, and gradually I find you start to pick things up. Whatever you write probably won't have great performance, etc, but it's better to learn that way for me"
24,2019-01-02T10:54:13.863300,Javier,I dead ass find coding tasks and tutorials for that language. Then I try to do something I'm interested in. If nothing else I try writing a mud game. That usually doesn't go well. It does help me know what I don't know though.

This should work properly."

38,2019-01-03T08:47:22.925900,Rocio,"ah, so you want to parse the URL"
38,2019-01-03T08:47:28.926200,Shanon,right
38,2019-01-03T08:48:07.926800,Rocio,"yeah, I don't think there's a library encompassing all storages in the world and implementing a delete() method for all of them."
38,2019-01-03T08:50:12.927500,Shanon,"<@Rocio> when you said `S3Folder` you meant I should implement that class, or were you thinking about a specific lib ?"
38,2019-01-03T09:07:11.929800,Rocio,<@Shanon> former
38,2019-01-03T09:07:32.930300,Shanon,"cool, thanks <@Rocio> :taco:"
39,2019-01-03T09:12:46.934100,Stepanie,"Hey guys, I have the following code, If it detects a keyword from the list ""keywords"" It will send a message to slack
If it detects a keyword from BOTH ""keywords"" and ""color_keywords"" then it will send the same message, but with the extra line
``` msg += ""\n*&lt;!here&gt; Colors was possibly detected along with one of our projects*""``` as shown below

I was wondering if it was possible, that when it detected a keyword from BOTH keyword lists instead of just sending an extra line of text like shown above
If it was possible to send another version of ```slack_data``` as shown in ```slack_data = {'attachments': [{'pretext': 'I detected the following word:', 'text': msg, 'color': '#3fce00', 'icon_emoji': ':cat:','as_user': 'false',}]}```
So I would be able to change the color and different options? so maybe if I made a slack_data2 or something

Here is the code

```if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in keywords):
            found_kws = [kw for kw in keywords if kw.lower() in comment.body.lower()]

            msg = MSG_TEMPLATE.format(
                keyword=found_kws[0],
                permalink=comment.permalink,
                author=comment.author,
                comment_body=comment.body
            )

            if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in color_keywords):
                msg += ""\n*&lt;!here&gt; Colors was possibly detected along with one of our projects*""

            slack_data = {'attachments': [{'pretext': 'I detected the following word:', 'text': msg, 'color': '#3fce00', 'icon_emoji': ':cat:','as_user': 'false',}]}
            
            

            response = <http://requests.post|requests.post>(
                SLACK_WEBHOOK,
                data=json.dumps(slack_data),
                headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}```

I am still quite new to Python and trying to find my way around things, but this really has me stumped!
Any help would be really appreciated!"
39,2019-01-03T09:22:03.934200,Asha,"If I'm understanding you correctly, I believe the easiest way to accomplish this is to set ```slack_data``` inside the if block, and use an else to cover the case that there is no keyword found from the color_keywords list"
39,2019-01-03T09:22:30.934400,Asha,"That way the conditional would be responsible for setting slack_data, and you could cover both cases"
39,2019-01-03T09:37:06.938500,Rocio,"and you probably want `temp=40, bol=0`"
39,2019-01-03T09:37:24.938700,Rocio,strings and integers are not the same thing
39,2019-01-03T09:41:04.941300,Rocio,"you also probably want `FarenheitToCelsius` and `CelsiusToFarenheit`, it's better practice."
39,2019-01-03T09:41:18.941500,Stepanie,Oh really? it's possible to do it that way?
39,2019-01-03T09:41:41.942100,Candi,"do you mean this def TempConv(temp=40,bol=0):"
39,2019-01-03T09:41:55.942300,Rocio,yes
39,2019-01-03T09:43:08.942800,Candi,thank you it worked thank you
39,2019-01-03T09:43:16.943100,Candi,sorry stupid me
39,2019-01-03T09:43:48.943200,Candi,okay ill keep this in mind Thank you
39,2019-01-03T09:46:15.943500,Candi,Also in the terminal window on line 5 none has been  added. Why is it so ?
39,2019-01-03T09:46:51.944200,Stepanie,"So for example. the if block is currently ```if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in keywords):
            found_kws = [kw for kw in keywords if kw.lower() in comment.body.lower()]```
How would I go about putting the slack_data into that?

And then I guess I would be changing ```if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in color_keywords):
                msg += ""\n*&lt;!here&gt; Colors was possibly detected along with one of our projects*""``` to an else statement? and then make a slack_data2 for it to read from?
I did try changing if to else on that, but got an error (as you would expect) like I said, I am still quite new and trying to figure it all out"
39,2019-01-03T09:46:51.944400,Candi,my code do not a mention of none
39,2019-01-03T09:47:21.944800,Kiera,"if a function does not explicitly `return` a value, then it returns `None`"
39,2019-01-03T09:48:02.945400,Candi,alright thank you
39,2019-01-03T09:48:16.945600,Sau,hello guys
39,2019-01-03T09:48:39.946400,Sau,I have an EC2 instance runing on ubuntu and the python program with virtualenv
39,2019-01-03T09:49:01.947100,Sau,My question is how can I run the python script in the background of the linux with virtualenv? even if I close the terminal
39,2019-01-03T09:49:13.947500,Sau,what is the command line on linux that could help me achieve this?
39,2019-01-03T09:51:28.947900,Kiera,have you created a virtual environment using the `virtualenv` command?
39,2019-01-03T09:51:45.948200,Sau,yes
39,2019-01-03T09:51:47.948400,Kiera,okay.
39,2019-01-03T09:51:53.948700,Sau,but everytime I need to run the script
39,2019-01-03T09:52:05.949400,Sau,I have to activate the virtualenv
39,2019-01-03T09:52:14.949800,Ashley,"<@Sau> a virtual env is mostly just a modification to your PATH variable so when you reference python, it looks for the executable in your virtual env's directory first. "
39,2019-01-03T09:52:40.950800,Kiera,you can also run the script by using the `bin/python` program in the virtual environment directory.
39,2019-01-03T09:53:05.951500,Kiera,"if you created a virtual environment called `$HOME/venv`, then you would run `$HOME/venv/bin/python mypythonscript.py`"
39,2019-01-03T09:53:07.951900,Ashley,"If you reference it directly, you mostly don't need the virtual env"
39,2019-01-03T09:53:33.952500,Jimmy,referencing the python inside the environment is the same as activating and then executing
39,2019-01-03T09:54:33.953900,Alvina,"does Alembic make sense for tables based on ingesting CSV or other files where the output can change without warning? for example, a client adds or removes certain columns to the file"
39,2019-01-03T09:54:35.954000,Kiera,"alternatively, you can do something like `(. $HOME/venv/bin/activate; python mypythonscript.py)`"
39,2019-01-03T09:55:03.954500,Kiera,"if you put it in `()` parentheses, you can then put the entire thing in the backgrouund `(…) &amp;`."
39,2019-01-03T09:55:16.954800,Sau,so
39,2019-01-03T09:55:31.955700,Sau,what is the $HOME
39,2019-01-03T09:55:34.956000,Kiera,but just running directly from the virtual environment's `python` is easier:  `$HOME/venv/bin/python mypythonscript.py &amp;`
39,2019-01-03T09:55:46.956600,Sau,Can I do source /venv/bin/python …
39,2019-01-03T09:56:00.957200,Ashley,HOME is another environment variable like PATH
39,2019-01-03T09:56:11.957600,Kiera,replace `$HOME/venv` with the path to your virtual environment.  That was just an example.
39,2019-01-03T09:56:11.957700,Ashley,It just says where your home directory is
39,2019-01-03T09:56:27.958200,Sau,ah
39,2019-01-03T09:56:37.958600,Sau,I can do pwd to see the path
39,2019-01-03T09:56:48.958800,Kiera,"so - if you created the virtual environment in `/tmp/mypython`, you would use `/tmp/mypython/bin/python`."
39,2019-01-03T09:57:24.959400,Sau,Yeah so I have the src code being outside of the env package
39,2019-01-03T09:57:33.959800,Sau,I think I can do ()
39,2019-01-03T09:57:43.960200,Kiera,where the source code lives doesn't actually matter.
39,2019-01-03T09:57:46.960400,Sau,(. $HOME/venv/bin/activate; python src/mypythonscript.py)
39,2019-01-03T09:58:10.960900,Kiera,"the virtual environment directory is there to contain the python modules that are installed in that virtual environment, not to contain your source code that is using that python."
39,2019-01-03T09:58:35.961500,Ashley,Yep
39,2019-01-03T09:58:44.962000,Kiera,so you can use `…/venv/bin/python src/mypythonscript.py` directly no matter where the virtual environment and/or `mypythonscript.py` are.
39,2019-01-03T09:59:19.962900,Sau,ah
39,2019-01-03T10:00:45.963900,Sau,So I can use the () parantheses to indicate the linux to run background right?
39,2019-01-03T10:01:00.964500,Sau,Like (/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python src/myphthon.py)
39,2019-01-03T10:01:25.965000,Kiera,"no, the `()` are to allow you to group commands together into a subshell and run the group of commands in the background."
39,2019-01-03T10:01:26.965100,Ashley,The python executable for your virtual env is basically hardcore to look at those directories in that venv's directory
39,2019-01-03T10:04:23.965500,Sau,So i did the following thing
39,2019-01-03T10:04:24.965700,Sau,(/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python  src/app.py ) &amp;
39,2019-01-03T10:04:39.966200,Sau,it is working okay but when it exit the terminal
39,2019-01-03T10:04:48.966600,Sau,it is opted out
39,2019-01-03T10:04:58.966900,Sau,"hmm, I am wondering what I do wrong"
39,2019-01-03T10:07:32.968600,Clemmie,"You need to use either `nohup` before the command, which tells it to ignore the logout (the `&amp;` just sends it to the background)  Alternatively, and I think better, you can run everything in `tmux`, which gives you a terminal that persists between sessions"
39,2019-01-03T10:08:10.969200,Sau,"nohup (/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python  src/app.py ) &amp;
-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python’"
39,2019-01-03T10:08:23.969900,Sau,"when I did the nohup , but the seems like to have the error"
39,2019-01-03T10:08:25.970000,Kiera,first off
39,2019-01-03T10:08:36.970400,Kiera,you don't use the `()` if you only are running a single command.
39,2019-01-03T10:10:14.970900,Sau,ah
39,2019-01-03T10:10:17.971100,Sau,Cool Cool
39,2019-01-03T10:10:18.971300,Sau,:smile:
39,2019-01-03T10:10:30.971800,Rocio,"or better yet, use a systemd service or whatever your supervisor is"
39,2019-01-03T10:10:50.972300,Kiera,"it also should be possible to do this without `nohup`, since `nohup` will annoyingly create a file `nohup.out` with the output from the script."
39,2019-01-03T10:11:25.973600,Kiera,"you can try this:
```
/home/ubuntu/rcs_mwc_receipt_api/env/bin/python src/app.py &lt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
```"
39,2019-01-03T10:11:25.973700,Sau,May I ask for the alternative way <@Kiera>?
39,2019-01-03T10:11:57.974100,Kiera,"try that, see if it works to continue running the script after the shell exits."
39,2019-01-03T10:14:02.974400,Rocio,`nohup ... &gt; /dev/null` works too if you don't want the nohup.out file
39,2019-01-03T10:15:12.975000,Kiera,"okay.  that doesn't work for all versions of nohup, but if it works for debian, that's great."
39,2019-01-03T10:15:32.976100,Sau,Thank you <@Rocio> and <@Kiera>
39,2019-01-03T10:15:37.976400,Sau,it is all fun
39,2019-01-03T10:16:48.977600,Sau,so I guess with the java jar build file
39,2019-01-03T10:16:54.977800,Sau,I could do the same thing
39,2019-01-03T10:17:59.978800,Kiera,"some versions of `sh`, `ksh`, `zsh`, `csh`."
39,2019-01-03T10:18:05.979100,Kiera,(and `csh` variants)
39,2019-01-03T10:18:49.979300,Sau,so <@Kiera>
39,2019-01-03T10:19:49.982200,Sau,home/ubuntu/booking-calendar-clx/booking-back-end/build/libs/gs-spring-boot-0.1.0.jar &lt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
39,2019-01-03T10:20:09.982800,Clemmie,I would still suggest working in tmux - it gets rid of all these issues because the tmux shell itself persists. I haven’t had to use `nohup` or `&amp;` in the 4 years since I started using tmux
39,2019-01-03T10:21:00.984200,Clemmie,oh - is this supposed to be automated a the end? It read like <@Sau> wants to fire it off and leave the session
39,2019-01-03T10:21:23.985300,Kiera,yep yep which? :)
39,2019-01-03T10:21:45.985800,Sau,just kicks off the execution and exit the terminal
39,2019-01-03T10:22:12.986800,Rocio,"<@Clemmie> the _correct_ solution is to use a supervisor, such as systemd, runit, supervisord, etc"
39,2019-01-03T10:22:28.987500,Asha,"Something like this possibly for the color keyword part ``` if any(kw.lower() in comment.body.lower() for kw in color_keywords):
                slack_data = {'attachments': [{'pretext': 'I detected the following word:', 'text': *msg_1*, 'color': '#3fce00', 'icon_emoji': ':cat:','as_user': 'false',}]}
else 
                slack_data = {'attachments': [{'pretext': 'I detected the following word:', 'text': msg, 'color': '#3fce00', 'icon_emoji': ':cat:','as_user': 'false',}]}```"
39,2019-01-03T10:22:42.988300,Clemmie,This sounds like a desire to do it interactively though
39,2019-01-03T10:22:43.988400,Kiera,"<@Sau> :
a)  are these commands that you are running by hand, or do you want to run them automatically (cron, or run in docker containers, etc.) ?
b)  do you care about capturing the output of the programs that get run ?"
39,2019-01-03T10:22:59.988600,Asha,"Using nested if statements isn't great, and I'm sure someone else could help you with something better, but that's the quick and dirty way I would think of first, before refactoring"
39,2019-01-03T10:23:20.989600,Sau,"so these commands are basically running by hand , and really want to run them automatically"
39,2019-01-03T10:23:28.990300,Sau,and also i don;’t care about the ouput
39,2019-01-03T10:23:30.990500,Sau,:smile:
39,2019-01-03T10:23:55.991400,Kiera,"do you need to run them in sequence?  (i.e. first run X, then run Y, then run Z)"
39,2019-01-03T10:24:03.991900,Sau,ah no
39,2019-01-03T10:24:14.992300,Clemmie,I enjoy supervisor <@Rocio>. But a question if you are well versed at it. Do you have a good way to restart a supervisorctl on system restart? I’ve not yet come across a great solution that doesn’t feel hacky
39,2019-01-03T10:24:19.992500,Sau,they are all runing indepentdently
39,2019-01-03T10:25:35.994400,Kiera,<@Sau> do you know how they will be automatically run?
39,2019-01-03T10:25:54.994800,Clemmie,<@Sau> <@Kiera> - Maybe cron then? It handles this cleanly by default. It would be perfect if you want it to run automatically at specified times and recurrence intervals
39,2019-01-03T10:26:18.995200,Kiera,"<@Clemmie> yes, that's what i'm trying to get to :)"

39,2019-01-03T10:27:12.998000,Rocio,"well, you could"
39,2019-01-03T10:27:49.999100,Clemmie,tech debt i guess
39,2019-01-03T10:28:06.999600,Rocio,systemd has a lot of options related to being a supervisor
39,2019-01-03T10:28:21.000200,Clemmie,"I also work on some old systems, so need to take a look at if all of them even have systemd"
39,2019-01-03T10:28:38.000800,Rocio,then good old sysvinit with dependencies in the comments.. :slightly_smiling_face:

39,2019-01-03T10:29:08.002000,Sau,I am trying to run some tests here
39,2019-01-03T10:29:09.002200,Kiera,<@Clemmie> <@Rocio> i pretty much despise systemd :(

39,2019-01-03T10:29:49.002800,Rocio,I usually use runit for containers though
39,2019-01-03T10:31:44.003200,Asha,"Or even better, you could just use a double conditional so  (in psuedo code) ```if keyword in keyword_list and color_keyword_list:

39,2019-01-03T10:40:48.006000,Jimmy,we generally try to encourage people to ask question in public. Easier to get a response and share knowledge that way :slightly_smiling_face:

39,2019-01-03T12:08:40.007100,Sau,a question
39,2019-01-03T12:08:44.007400,Sau,if I use systemd
39,2019-01-03T12:09:12.008000,Sau,then I can go ahead and edit my source code without worrying about the start of the script right
39,2019-01-03T12:09:19.008400,Sau,the script will run anyway
39,2019-01-03T12:09:25.008700,Sau,is that correct?
39,2019-01-03T12:17:26.009100,Kiera,you will probably need to tell systemd to restart your service in order to run the modified source code
40,2019-01-03T09:35:52.937700,Candi,I am beginner and was writing a code that is a function that converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius or visa versa. In the code I have given a default argument function as 40 degree Celsius but it is not able take the default values. What am I doing wrong.
40,2019-01-03T09:37:01.938300,Rocio,"<@Candi> unrelated: it's ""vice versa"", not ""visa versa"""
40,2019-01-03T09:40:51.940800,Candi,<@Rocio> sorry for the typo
41,2019-01-03T10:15:20.975200,Sau,both ways are working find
41,2019-01-03T10:15:22.975400,Sau,fine*
41,2019-01-03T10:15:30.975900,Rocio,"ah, fun"
41,2019-01-03T10:15:33.976200,Rocio,"```If standard output is a terminal, append output to 'nohup.out' if possible,

41,2019-01-03T10:15:51.976700,Rocio,didn't know shells had a built-in `nohup`
41,2019-01-03T10:17:10.978200,Rocio,"I wonder which shell has this built-in... not bash, from what I can see"
41,2019-01-03T10:19:05.979900,Sau,what if I have the java.jar file
41,2019-01-03T10:19:06.980100,Rocio,"for zsh I can only see a plugin, not core"
41,2019-01-03T10:19:15.980600,Sau,is this command working in the backgorund ?
41,2019-01-03T10:19:47.982000,Kiera,"<@Rocio> ah, i haven't used zsh, but i thought i remembered it having `nohup` built in."
41,2019-01-03T10:20:28.983300,Kiera,<@Clemmie> that's fine if you're doing interactive work that you want to get back to.  it's not a solution for automated processes.
41,2019-01-03T10:21:17.984900,Sau,yep yep
41,2019-01-03T10:21:18.985100,Sau,:smile:

41,2019-01-03T10:23:24.989900,Asha,Does that make sense?
41,2019-01-03T10:26:58.997400,Clemmie,"<@Rocio> yeah, that still feels a little hacky, like I should have just used systemd to start"
42,2019-01-03T14:46:12.013400,Magan,"Hey you sexy people. Quick question on this but I have Tkinter application that when it launches on execution does eveything except change the title from displaying ""tk"" despite that the line in the app specifically has. Is there something else I can look for?

Sample code below
```
#!/bin/env python3

__version__ = 1.0
__author__ = ""Ru""

import tkinter
from tkinter import ttk, filedialog
from tkinter.constants import *

# Program Version
testapp = <http://tkinter.Tk|tkinter.Tk>()
testapp.configure({'padx':10})

# Set Window Title
testapp.title = (""blu.py {}"".format(__version__))
testapp.mainloop()

```"
42,2019-01-03T14:56:16.014200,Sasha,"I think `title` is actually a function, not a property."
42,2019-01-03T15:09:44.014400,Magan,OMG.
42,2019-01-03T15:09:56.014700,Magan,"You know what let me test that out. Im probably that dumb
Edit: Yes I am that dumb."
42,2019-01-03T15:10:49.015300,Magan,Thank you <@Sasha>
42,2019-01-03T15:15:16.016600,Sasha,Easy mistake to make. I looked at like 3 examples online and didn't notice either.
43,2019-01-03T16:07:05.018500,Candra,I'm trying to write some sphinx documentation for the whole codebase I've built at my job. My question whether or not I should use the current source directory which is the parent of all the code I've written and just have the one Sphinx build OR use intersphinx in the multiple projects I have
43,2019-01-03T16:15:42.019200,Bethany,if all the source is under one parent i'd probably just do `parent/docs`
43,2019-01-03T16:15:46.019400,Bethany,and put it there
44,2019-01-03T16:46:44.019700,Cammie,"Lets say I have a little game that’s two players, so I have so functions

`playerTwoMoves(int coordinate)`
`playerOneMoves(int coordinate)`

This seems like a pretty bad design, as _if_ I want to support lets say three players, I’ll have to copy and paste a new function with almost the same functionality. How would you solve this?

I could have a single function that takes in a player id

`playerMoves(int playerId, int coordinate)`

but are there other or better options? I know I could use enums, or turn this into an OO design, *but what would you do?*"
44,2019-01-03T16:53:52.022900,Cammie,"I was addressing this problem from a testing point of view, cause I noticed my tests were the same for:

`playerTwoMoves(int coordinate)`
`playerOneMoves(int coordinate)`

and then noticed the amount of duplicated code and I didn’t like it"
44,2019-01-03T16:54:15.023400,Candra,"I think the single function is definitely nicer as they're both doing the same thing except with less code. The ID will work, but that entirely depends on how you identify a player. If you are not using an OO pattern then the ID is fine, if you want to use OO then you could simply create a player class and generate a new player object per person and also give them IDs."
44,2019-01-03T16:56:57.026100,Candra,"<@Bethany> Yeah, I think I may just write documentation within the code and clean up the code base. I feel like the majority of the concern I have, since I'm leaving this job, is that the sheer amount of code I've developed in my time here is pretty overwhelming to someone new coming in and most of what I've written are small scripts. Maybe simply writing docs within each script is a better/easier approach that way documentation written by whoever takes my spot here can be done in the same fashion without me having to also write documentation about writing docstrings etc..."
44,2019-01-03T16:57:44.026900,Candra,So basically write documentation for each script since I don't really have much in the way of modules with lots of functions. Just scripts that generate different reports etc...
44,2019-01-03T16:58:11.027400,Cammie,"Awesome, thanks for the input kbman. I think I’m just overthinking such a simple project.

I just really want to do a great write up about this and don’t want to showcase poor code ha thanks"
44,2019-01-03T16:58:41.027900,Candra,"<@Cammie> No worries, I suffer from the same thing just as my question above might show lol"
44,2019-01-03T16:59:45.029200,Candra,"I think either way works. Lots of people have their own opinions on OO and what not. A lot of my current code is not OO while some is, it really just depends on the use case. I think you'll be fine whatever you decide to do, but I'd say if you can just make the two separate functions into one."
44,2019-01-03T17:00:35.029300,Renetta,"I have run into a bit of a dead lock with a dictionary iteration, Can you point me where this is going wrong ?
The above is working for me however I'd like a different approach using for key,val in (dict): one is there any way we can do that ?"
44,2019-01-03T17:05:52.030900,Candra,"`for _, val in records['main']['sub'].items()`"
44,2019-01-03T17:12:03.031700,Bethany,"<@Candra> I'd focus first on writing decent docstrings. In particularly, use doctest and a python REPL to generate examples of usage"
44,2019-01-03T17:12:09.031900,Bethany,you can add sphinx later
44,2019-01-03T17:12:33.032200,Candra,The &gt;&gt;&gt; format?
44,2019-01-03T17:13:00.033100,Renetta,"yeah sorry, should've done that. My bad"
44,2019-01-03T17:13:03.033300,Candra,And yeah I've got every function documented. I'll be spending the next week or so writing more detailed information
44,2019-01-03T17:14:29.033600,Bethany,yeah like
44,2019-01-03T17:15:48.033900,Bethany,here's an example from one of mine
44,2019-01-03T17:15:56.034000,Bethany,None
44,2019-01-03T17:16:16.034500,Bethany,it's not the best but I find the examples help a lot
44,2019-01-03T17:19:56.035600,Candra,Okay cool. I currently am using the reStructedText docstrings. I'll basically get everything well documented and then decide if I need to use Sphinx. Thanks <@Bethany> :taco:
44,2019-01-03T17:20:19.035800,Bethany,oh yeah i use napoleon
44,2019-01-03T17:22:27.036300,Candra,I'll check it out. I like the idea of having the examples
44,2019-01-03T17:23:28.036700,Shan,"yea, the examples are a nice touch."
45,2019-01-03T18:36:52.036900,Hai,None
46,2019-01-03T18:41:51.037300,Hai,<@Sasha>
46,2019-01-03T18:44:30.037400,Sasha,You mean like this?
46,2019-01-03T18:46:30.038200,Hai,yes <@Sasha> I will try that now
46,2019-01-03T18:51:14.038600,Hai,<@Sasha> am getting an error string indices must be integer
46,2019-01-03T18:51:52.039000,Sasha,Sounds like your actual data may be different than the example.
46,2019-01-03T18:52:10.039500,Hai,I tried with single quotes also same error
46,2019-01-03T18:52:22.040000,Sasha,"(The example doesn't have list brackets around it, but I assumed that was a typo.)"
46,2019-01-03T18:54:46.041000,Kiera,<@Hai> can you post the complete example code that you're running and the actual error message?
46,2019-01-03T18:55:47.041700,Shan,I feel like that’s usually me asking that question.  thank you for doing the same.
46,2019-01-03T18:56:08.042400,Shan,:taco: for <@Kiera> for keeping solutions sane.
46,2019-01-03T18:57:06.042500,Hai,None
46,2019-01-03T18:58:53.043400,Hai,<@Sasha> <@Shan> <@Kiera>
46,2019-01-03T18:59:14.043900,Sasha,"Yeah, you're missing list brackets and commas around the dicts."
46,2019-01-03T19:00:17.044900,Hai,oh is there any way to make a valid JSON?
46,2019-01-03T19:00:48.045200,Sasha,Can you rephrase the question?
46,2019-01-03T19:02:13.046500,Kiera,"a valid JSON object is a dictionary at the top level.  so what you would need to do is something like:
```
response={
    u""response"": [
        {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a1"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}},
        {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}},
        {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}
    ]
}
```"
46,2019-01-03T19:04:10.048300,Hai,<@Kiera> in my output at the top level also it's not a dictionary
46,2019-01-03T19:05:05.049400,Hai,<@Sasha> how to make my output a valid JSON so that I can print the keys and values
46,2019-01-03T19:05:41.050900,Shan,"```response= {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a1"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}
          {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}
          {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}``` this isn’t valid python."
46,2019-01-03T19:05:43.051100,Kiera,"<@Hai> your post still does not make sense.  please make one post with a valid python script that demonstrates the problem you are having, and a second post with the output from that script, and a third post describing what you expected."
46,2019-01-03T19:05:57.051200,Leana,Knowing how to ask a good question is a highly invaluable skill that will benefit you greatly in any career. <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask> is a good collection of suggestions and strategies to help you structure and phrase your question to make it easier for those here to understand your problem and help you work to a solution.
46,2019-01-03T19:07:25.052800,Kiera,"<@Hai> in general:  JSON = JavaScript Object Notation.  It uses JavaScript syntax to describe an ""object"" (which is represented in Python as a dictionary).  Objects contain keys which are strings (and only strings) mapped to values which may be numbers, strings, objects, or arrays of numbers, strings, objects, or arrays."
46,2019-01-03T19:07:56.053500,Kiera,"in order to produce valid JSON, you need to produce a dictionary which has string keys and values of the appropriate types described above, and feed that dictionary to `json.dumps`."
46,2019-01-03T19:13:24.054200,Hai,None
46,2019-01-03T19:15:02.054900,Kiera,"try this:
```
print(type(data))
```"
46,2019-01-03T19:15:07.055100,Kiera,oh.
46,2019-01-03T19:15:08.055300,Kiera,yes.
46,2019-01-03T19:15:21.055700,Kiera,you did `data = json.dumps(response)`
46,2019-01-03T19:15:37.056200,Kiera,`json.dumps` converts a python object into a string holding the JSON representation of that object.
46,2019-01-03T19:15:52.056700,Kiera,you then did `for item in data` which loops through each character of the string.
46,2019-01-03T19:16:37.057800,Hai,"<@Kiera> so should i remove the json.dumps and directly loop through response?? but response has ""u"" is it okay?/"
46,2019-01-03T19:18:04.059400,Kiera,"i don't know what `request` and `response` are, so i can't tell you whether looping through response is what you need to do.  if `response` is a Python list, or something that acts like a Python list, then `for item in response` would work in the loop at the bottom."
46,2019-01-03T19:18:45.060400,Kiera,"* that is, if it acts like a list of dictionaries which have a `""temp""` key that contains another dictionary with `""a""` and `""b""` keys..."
46,2019-01-03T19:19:13.060800,Kiera,what happens if you do `print(repr(response))` ?
46,2019-01-03T19:19:28.061100,Hai,<@Kiera> i didnt try i will try noew
46,2019-01-03T19:19:33.061300,Hai,now*
46,2019-01-03T19:20:32.061600,Kiera,"anyway, i need to get going."
46,2019-01-03T19:26:02.062400,Hai,<@Shan> is there any way to make that output to a valid JSON?
46,2019-01-03T19:27:01.062500,Shan,<@Hai>
46,2019-01-03T19:27:54.063100,Shan,"you could also do ```response = [ {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a1"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}},
          {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}},
          {u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}} ]```"
46,2019-01-03T19:28:58.063700,Hai,<@Shan> how would I add square brackets and commas after each json?
46,2019-01-03T19:29:54.064200,Shan,alright.  so backing up.  give me the script you are working with.
46,2019-01-03T19:31:16.065200,Shan,"are you saying that when you `request.get(my_url)`, you are getting the following as a response? ```
{u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a1"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}
{u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}
{u""temp"": {u""a"":u""a2"",u""b"":u""b2"",u""c"":""c3""}}```"
46,2019-01-03T19:31:52.065600,Hai,<@Shan> yes perfect
46,2019-01-03T19:33:57.067200,Shan,"split on a newline, `\n`, and iterate through each line, and jsonify the line, and append to a list."
46,2019-01-03T19:35:53.068100,Hai,<@Shan> how would we know the json ends at the same line? my each json is very large
46,2019-01-03T19:37:18.068500,Shan,okay…do you have control over what the source outputs?
46,2019-01-03T19:37:30.069000,Hai,<@Shan>
46,2019-01-03T19:37:34.069400,Hai,yes
46,2019-01-03T19:37:42.069700,Shan,the smarter thing would be to fix the service you’re `get`ting from to output proper json.
46,2019-01-03T19:38:35.071100,Hai,<@Shan> no no i dont have that control on that
46,2019-01-03T19:38:38.071200,Shan,the next way would be to create some functions that iterate through lines and pieces together valid json through a series of checks.
46,2019-01-03T19:38:46.071500,Shan,but that method would be taxing.
46,2019-01-03T19:39:45.072400,Hai,<@Shan> yeahh
46,2019-01-03T19:40:51.073500,Shan,"Maybe not.  you could iterate through each line, count the first iteration of `[` or `{` and then count the open brackets before the closing one so that you can intelligently navigate full json."
46,2019-01-03T19:41:19.073800,Shan,why does the service give you this format for info?
46,2019-01-03T19:42:40.075300,Hai,<@Shan>I can try that. I don't know it's coming from a different app. I mean actually am getting in that format. did you see my code?
46,2019-01-03T19:43:11.075400,Hai,None
46,2019-01-03T19:43:25.075800,Shan,oh dear lord.
46,2019-01-03T19:44:36.076600,Shan,"i incorrectly assumed.  although, i cant see why `response.json()` or `json.dumps(response)` would work."
46,2019-01-03T19:45:27.077200,Hai,"<@Shan> yeahh but after doing json.dumps() it is juts removing the ""u""  but still not giving a valid json"
46,2019-01-03T19:49:18.078400,Shan,maybe just `split('=')` and hope that its never in the data.  then `split('\n')` and hope that newlines only exist at the and of a “json” line.
46,2019-01-03T19:49:41.078900,Shan,work backwards from there as errors crop up due to this sillyness.
46,2019-01-03T19:50:12.079100,Hai,yeahh i will try
46,2019-01-03T19:58:12.079300,Shan,"so, this is crude af."
46,2019-01-03T19:58:23.079500,Hai,hahahha
46,2019-01-03T20:00:12.080000,Shan,i’m not proud of it.  theres a few things you can do to clean this up but…the gist.
46,2019-01-03T20:02:51.081200,Shan,but. i challenge you to inspect you data better.
46,2019-01-03T20:03:06.081800,Shan,see what you can do to manipulate it to fit your needs.

I have a conceptual problem, and I hope I describe it clearly.

I am making a script that logs into a ticket selling website, picks a pass level, and goes through each event in the calendar to confirm if certain discounts are applied.

Logically, I’m a bit stumped. I’m selecting users by text with Selenium. And I select by drop down menu based on a loop that goes through the entire index of choices in the drop down (also Selenium). I can get all this to work.

How should I set up the structure to pick a new user once it’s gone through all the events? Should that be another block of the same code w/ a different username selected? Or could I create a loop that picks a new user once all the events are tested?"

63,2019-01-05T06:53:04.187200,Shellie,should be simple but cannot get it to work
63,2019-01-05T06:54:04.188100,Raven,<@Shellie> There's nothing in your existing code that tries to extract individual cells based on position. It looks like you're just throwing every single cell in most of the tables into `values`
63,2019-01-05T06:54:34.189000,Shellie,"yep//true, i tried 101 ways but removed them all because I cannot get that to work"
63,2019-01-05T06:54:44.189200,Raven,"If you get a row, then you can use `row[2]`, `row[4]`, `row[5]` to extract the individual cells"
63,2019-01-05T06:54:54.189500,Shellie,Extended with two more loops and saving to new list
63,2019-01-05T06:54:55.189700,Shellie,all fail
63,2019-01-05T06:55:39.190600,Raven,"`row.find_all(['th','td'])` looks like it gives you a list of cells. Just take the individual ones you want"
63,2019-01-05T06:57:23.191600,Raven,You're calling `csv_writer.writeheader()` several times in a loop
63,2019-01-05T06:57:28.191800,Raven,That's just a guess.
63,2019-01-05T06:58:15.192100,Raven,"For every keyword, you write a header, then write a row"
63,2019-01-05T06:59:02.192300,Lucius,"yep, exactly what happens"
63,2019-01-05T06:59:15.192500,Raven,So... stop doing that :wink:
63,2019-01-05T06:59:26.192700,Lucius,xD
63,2019-01-05T07:07:50.193500,Lucius,"somehow i'm finding this harder than it probably should be :smile: Either i'm getting 0 results, or 15, or it just saves my last keyword -_-"
63,2019-01-05T07:15:28.193800,Raven,You're probably overwriting something each time you enter that loop
63,2019-01-05T07:16:39.194500,Raven,"This, for example:
```
    for i in range(top_post_count):
        #Getting data from top posts
        top_post_likes = response['graphql']['hashtag']['edge_hashtag_to_top_posts']['edges'][i]['node']['edge_liked_by']
        post_like = response['graphql']['hashtag']['edge_hashtag_to_top_posts']['edges'][i]['node']['edge_liked_by']['count']
        post_comment = response['graphql']['hashtag']['edge_hashtag_to_top_posts']['edges'][i]['node']['edge_media_to_comment']['count']
        likes_value.append(post_like)
        comments_value.append(post_comment)
```"
63,2019-01-05T07:16:59.195200,Raven,You overwrite `top_post_likes` each time
63,2019-01-05T07:18:08.195700,Raven,"Similarly, what do you think `post_info.update` does? It will be overwriting that data in `post_info`"
63,2019-01-05T07:18:50.196400,Raven,"If in doubt, print out everything at each stage, then compare it to what you expected to see. You'll get a feel for when you're doing the right thing."
63,2019-01-05T07:20:36.197000,Raven,(I'm not convinced your min/max/avg calculations are correct either - they seem to be rolling values which seems like an odd choice)
63,2019-01-05T07:23:47.197300,Lucius,"i tested them actually, afaik they were correct"
63,2019-01-05T07:25:10.198400,Lucius,"the thing I'm doing actually is feeding my script a .txt file with keywords. Then scraping IG for the post data of each of those tags.
And my desired output is a .csv with header row and the keyword + its data on a new row"
63,2019-01-05T07:26:43.198800,Raven,Sure. Not sure how that relates to what we were saying though
63,2019-01-05T07:29:59.199400,Lucius,I probably didn't fully understand your remark about the calc's :slightly_smiling_face:
63,2019-01-05T07:32:25.200300,Raven,"The comment about the calculations is that your first time through the loop the min/max/avg will be the same (as you only have one data point to work with), then the next time you'll have 2, then 3"
63,2019-01-05T07:32:38.200700,Raven,"It's possible that is what you intend, but it's hard for me to imagine a data set where that would be true"
63,2019-01-05T07:33:23.201400,Lucius,"I think I did it that way, to be able to use min &amp; max later on. Because each time i perform the loop, I would be adding the next value to the list"
63,2019-01-05T07:34:16.202100,Raven,"Well, it looks wrong to me, but only you can know for sure, because I don't know what you intend"
63,2019-01-05T07:34:53.202400,Raven,Also - I don't think you really want to do this `likes_value = comments_value = []`
63,2019-01-05T07:35:14.202700,Raven,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; likes_value = comments_value = []

&gt;&gt;&gt; likes_value
[123]

I'm currently trying to clean up my Instagram hashtag scraper to use less indentation and more functions or subroutines. Right now I'm cleaning up my .csv writer but somehow my header is printed multiple times. 

Anyone willing to have a look to help identify my issue? "
64,2019-01-05T06:37:40.177000,Raven,In what way doesn't it work?
64,2019-01-05T06:49:56.183400,Lucius,made a dump of mine :slightly_smiling_face: <https://codedump.io/share/0bwcgUK3a15u/1>
64,2019-01-05T06:52:14.185600,Raven,"<@Lucius> It already looks okay in terms of indentation level. Certainly you could factor out more functions, but I'd say it would be your choice of how to do it. Find any bit of code that looks like it could be self-contained, create a function from it, and only return whatever is needed for the next part of the program"
64,2019-01-05T06:53:03.187100,Raven,<@Lucius> The first candidate might be moving everything inside the `for keyword in keywords` loop to a function
64,2019-01-05T06:56:12.191300,Lucius,"<@Raven> thanks for the suggestion! I'll test it out ^^. Do you see any reason why my csv writes multiple headers? I clean them up later by removing all duplicates rows, but i shouldn't be writing that in the first place.  :disappointed:"
64,2019-01-05T07:16:55.194800,Lucius,"This is what I'm currently running, changed some indentation and moved my post_info.update higher.


That's giving me the header correctly, but only the last keyword"

68,2019-01-05T12:07:13.213600,Lanelle,how this will help?
68,2019-01-05T12:41:24.216200,Sasha,"<@Mathilde> What your code does is convert all the numbers to strings and then concatenate them, so `my_str` ends up as `""424911""`. Then the for loop iterates over it one character at a time, converting back to int, so `my_list` would be `[4, 2, 4, 9, 1, 1]`. Then the `max` function correctly finds the maximum value of 9."
68,2019-01-05T12:42:13.216500,Mathilde,Thank you <@Sasha>
68,2019-01-05T12:44:29.217800,Sasha,"Note that `max()` already does what you want, in that `max(42, 4, 9, 1, 1)` returns 42."
68,2019-01-05T12:46:39.219300,Mathilde,Would you suggest I use different approach here and start from scratch  or should I try find a way to make it work with converting form str to int?
68,2019-01-05T12:50:56.220000,Sasha,Start from scratch. The string conversion is pretty pointless when you want to do a numeric operation.
68,2019-01-05T12:52:08.220300,Mathilde,"ok, will do. Thanks!"
68,2019-01-05T15:50:04.224200,Sasha,"I'm not familiar with pipreq3, but maybe there's information that some dependency has only been tested with library foo v1.1.0 through v1.4.1, so it errs on the side of caution by forcing v1.4.1 instead of the newly-available but unverified v1.5.0."

Yep the program works fine with other gz File.

#2: Am Using 14 + python lists &amp; few dictionaries to save &amp; Process Log Fields in that Program , is that a wrong idea to use large numbers of lists &amp; dictionary in same python function?

71,2019-01-05T20:40:54.250600,Sasha,"No particular bottlenecks with the length of lists, but some operations, like insert and delete, will get slower linearly with the list length, so if you do that a lot, you may want a different data structure."

71,2019-01-05T20:50:40.255300,Sasha,"The counter will still need to store a copy of every unique line, so the memory used will depend on how much variety there is in the file."

Use them to package your code and to publish it in <https://pypi.org/> . There are many tutorials using `setuptools` and `setup.py` files, but for new packages is way easier to use these new tools.

78,2019-01-06T07:14:39.304000,Shyla,"*Create an MP3 file from samples?*

Hi all, I'm a total newbie to Python (I'm a JS developer), but I have a specific task I'm trying to achieve with it....
I want to create an MP3/WAV comprising of an audio clip that is repeated at specific time intervals (which are taken from an array of microseconds that I already have). This is for usage as a drummer's click track.

Basically I need to load an MP3/WAV clip, loop through the array of microseconds, set the clip at these times and then output a single MP3 file.

*Is this possible with Python?*

I've looked at several audio libraries such as Librosa but can't find any hints on how I could achieve this!
Thanks!"
78,2019-01-06T07:33:01.304300,Jettie,Python has something in standard library: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html>
78,2019-01-06T07:33:19.304700,Jettie,should be enough to do basic things like composing a stream out of chunks
78,2019-01-06T07:37:24.305700,Shyla,"<@Jettie> Thanks, just read the documentation but can't see a clear way of doing this. Is it something a beginner could achieve?"

78,2019-01-06T07:43:59.307400,Shyla,to cut a long story short - this should be possible using the standard Python library?
78,2019-01-06T07:46:56.307700,Jettie,I'd say yes
78,2019-01-06T07:47:05.307900,Jettie,best to try

Second, this is the sort of task a simple DAW or audio editor is designed for - is there a reason you're not using one?"
78,2019-01-06T10:52:20.310800,Shyla,"<@Raven> Sorry the measurements are in milliseconds. I cannot use a DAW as I need to snap the samples to the timings from the original MP3. This is not in constant time, so I cannot simply use a grid at a set BPM"

Hence a GUI or another language is used as a way to display the logic, and or data to a user. UI/UX is the methodology of making that GUI or Display language(HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascript, as a few examples) Play nicely with users in a fashion that makes it easier for users to understand with out needing to know what goes into the product. Also with markdown, it is a language similar to HTML and slack uses it to interpret the messages typed into the chat boxes, as such symbols such as  _  etc, have special abilities granted to them through the markdown language so it may not be  UI/UX limitation you are working with so much as a markdown limitation, or lack of enough markdown syntax knowledge"

80,2019-01-06T14:40:29.362600,Clint,"UI/UX is not the software you are looking at, the software a user looks at is what is known as a Front End coding languages, UI, is the methodology is the process of using front end languages like HTML, Markdown, styling such as CSS, in a way so that a User can Interact with the program that has been written, it does not need to be a great experience but a user needs to be able to push a button and the desired effect happens, UI is setting up that button, Back end languages such as Python and Ruby, C# etc, are what make the Button do something.

UX is a methodology that improves the User Experience,  sure you have a button and it does something, but is it intuitive and was it easy for the user to figure out what to do with a minimal amount of explanation.  You combine the 2 to improve the over all usage of the application be it a web site, web app mobile app etc.

In fact because most of the work that goes in to UI/UX is in User research and design, Often the UI/UX lead does very little if any actual programing. They are very customer facing and need to know the current flows in styles in the market, try and improve UX, etc, Most of my friend who work in UI/UX work directly with a front end engineering team so that they (the front end team) can program out the Design and the UI/UX based on his (the UI/UX engineer) research, The Front End team will work with the Back End team to make sure the functionality is happening as it should. The languages Used in Front end languages will always have some direct correlation to restrictions on what can be done from a UI/UX point of view, but as they improve the options on how to use them Will improve as well.

This is very simplified as there are a lot more moving pieces, but I hope that gives you a better Idea of what is going on.

Good luck in your programing journey"

* if in the extremely rare event (0.000011111%) that there are 10 reliable sources, and no reliable sources says otherwise, then this most definitely not what i mean by UX/UI. i ofc mean it in the common usage of the term/word that ppl that actually know about UX/UI talk about

(aka: i've never heard anything so false in my entire life thus far)

UI = user interface (a thing, an object, what the user sees), and that is *not* a methodology (method for a process), and if there's a sub-meaning or related meant/intended by a diff word, im not sure which phrase/word is actually meant. user interface is very obviously

93,2019-01-07T13:42:00.487500,Violeta,None
93,2019-01-07T13:42:22.488200,Violeta,"I googled this multiple times now, but I can't seem to find a valid answer :confused:"
93,2019-01-07T13:42:32.488400,Shan,has it ever worked?
93,2019-01-07T13:42:40.488600,Violeta,locally
93,2019-01-07T13:43:05.489000,Jettie,what's the connection url?
93,2019-01-07T13:43:45.489400,Violeta,connection url? like the website?
93,2019-01-07T13:43:53.489900,Jettie,"no, in your configuration"
93,2019-01-07T13:43:59.490100,Jettie,DATABASES = ...
93,2019-01-07T13:44:08.490400,Violeta,None

93,2019-01-07T13:44:24.491100,Shan,`<sqlite://user:pass@localhost/db_name>`
93,2019-01-07T13:45:22.491800,Shan,thats a db uri.
93,2019-01-07T13:45:32.492300,Shan,what user are the files owned by?
93,2019-01-07T13:46:09.492700,Shan,are you that user as well?
93,2019-01-07T13:46:46.493800,Shan,annnd
93,2019-01-07T13:46:58.494400,Shan,`sqlite3 --version`
93,2019-01-07T13:47:01.494600,Jettie,"the ""schema"" is missing"
93,2019-01-07T13:47:03.495000,Shan,whats that output
93,2019-01-07T13:47:03.495100,Violeta,"I'm not sure exactly, I'm not very experienced with deploying and with server stuff. I'm trying to deploy this on a university server"
93,2019-01-07T13:47:16.495800,Jettie,"i.e., it's /var/www/something.db, and should be sqlite:////var/www/something.db"
93,2019-01-07T13:47:17.495900,Kiera,what is the value for `BASE_DIR`?
93,2019-01-07T13:47:17.496100,Violeta,I got access to a folder and so I plopped my project in there
93,2019-01-07T13:47:35.496600,Violeta,`3.6.20`
93,2019-01-07T13:47:35.496700,Shan,…
93,2019-01-07T13:47:37.497100,Shan,ah
93,2019-01-07T13:47:52.497400,Shan,<https://github.com/django/django/pull/10265>
93,2019-01-07T13:48:14.497800,Shan,<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/django-updates/1A-1aWPSXi0>
93,2019-01-07T13:48:32.498000,Violeta,`BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))`
93,2019-01-07T13:48:49.498400,Shan,"no no, he means, what is the actual value."
93,2019-01-07T13:49:05.499000,Kiera,"yup, <@Jettie> had it - missing the URI schema."
93,2019-01-07T13:49:28.499400,Shan,"guys, it works locally."
93,2019-01-07T13:49:34.499700,Violeta,ah so I need SQLite 3.7.15?
93,2019-01-07T13:49:38.499800,Gianna,<@Shan> can you check my last problem please
93,2019-01-07T13:50:30.500800,Shan,"so based on that, im going to assume its related to the link i posted above, but its hard to say for sure.  maybe hardcode a db uri to contain the `sqlite://` prefix too"
93,2019-01-07T13:50:58.501200,Shan,<@Gianna> i asked you if you went to that url in the error.
93,2019-01-07T13:51:20.501500,Violeta,base_dir should be `/htdocs/www/crowdhydrology_test/crowd_hydrology`
93,2019-01-07T13:52:15.502600,Gianna,<@Shan> no i dont it was other problem so i found other code which update and work for me but i get my this problem when i use other language `SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xd0'`
93,2019-01-07T13:52:56.503000,Shan,<@Gianna> the screenshot you posted literally has a url in it about the issue.
93,2019-01-07T13:53:25.503400,Gianna,i think it fixed after add this `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-`
93,2019-01-07T13:53:38.503700,Shan,there you go.
93,2019-01-07T14:32:06.504800,Violeta,fixed my issue :slightly_smiling_face:
93,2019-01-07T14:33:10.506100,Shan,what was it?
93,2019-01-07T14:33:52.506900,Violeta,"I went back to my local env, made a requirement.txt and then used that on the prod server to reinstall the modules"
93,2019-01-07T14:34:16.507300,Shan,ha. nice.
93,2019-01-07T14:36:10.509000,Violeta,"now when I run runserver though, I don’t see it on the webpage :weary:. I think the server is somewhat down? I have to ask my university admin guy to restart my apache service"
93,2019-01-07T14:36:43.509400,Shan,well…
93,2019-01-07T14:36:55.509700,Shan,is your application sitting behind apache?
93,2019-01-07T14:37:10.510300,Shan,"you said it failed to run with `manage.py`, which tells me nope."
93,2019-01-07T14:37:17.510500,Violeta,I’m following this tutorial: <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-django-applications-with-apache-and-mod_wsgi-on-ubuntu-14-04>
93,2019-01-07T14:37:24.510900,Shan,ah'
93,2019-01-07T14:37:45.511400,Shan,have you begun to look at the log files?
93,2019-01-07T14:38:12.512100,Violeta,hm good idea
93,2019-01-07T14:38:19.512400,Violeta,lol
93,2019-01-07T14:38:27.512900,Shan,"also, if you run the runserver"
93,2019-01-07T14:38:33.513200,Shan,can you at least hit it over that port?
93,2019-01-07T14:40:13.514100,Violeta,"yeah that’s what I was trying to say, when I run it on port 8000 and go to the website:8000 nothing shows"
93,2019-01-07T14:40:29.514500,Shan,&lt;ip_address&gt;:8000
93,2019-01-07T14:40:42.515100,Hiroko,are you running it with `./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`?
93,2019-01-07T14:44:46.515500,Violeta,yep and yep
93,2019-01-07T14:45:16.516500,Violeta,"might be a firewall thing? still working out the tutorial with apache, currently have a syntax error in the config"
93,2019-01-07T14:45:21.516700,Clemmie,"If it is a well admined university server, then everything not explicitly exposed is going to be blocked, including :8000"
93,2019-01-07T14:45:30.517000,Shan,^
93,2019-01-07T14:46:09.518000,Clemmie,"You are going to need to get apache set up correctly and server via :80 or :443 (hhtp, https, no need for the port on the ip)"
93,2019-01-07T14:46:21.518300,Clemmie,Do you need to use apache? nginx is simpler
93,2019-01-07T14:47:05.518900,Clemmie,I tend to run nginx+gunicorn
93,2019-01-07T14:47:49.519300,Clemmie,If you like the digital ocean docs then - <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-14-04>
93,2019-01-07T14:50:10.520400,Violeta,Would it be alright if I ran it on port 8020? There’s a wordpress site being displayed on port 80. My Django proj is just backend stuff
93,2019-01-07T14:50:43.521400,Violeta,they already had apache on the server so it seemed easiest
93,2019-01-07T14:51:52.522800,Cathern,It is. Nothing wrong with Apache and mod_wsgi
93,2019-01-07T14:52:01.523200,Cathern,"I wouldn't mess with your Uni admin over things like that, will be a bit of a headache"
93,2019-01-07T14:52:05.523400,Clemmie,"If the machine is set up correctly, by default no other ports will be available via url. You can get into using VirtualHosts in apache to handle this, but you are going to need to have domain names for both services"
93,2019-01-07T14:52:13.523800,Clemmie,"apache+mod_wsgi is fine, yes"
93,2019-01-07T14:52:41.524400,Clemmie,"If it is running background services and you never need to access it through the browser, then yeah, you can use :8000"
93,2019-01-07T15:09:37.526100,Clemmie,"You mean the same key? No. Though you won’t get an error, you will never be able to reach the second one"
94,2019-01-07T15:09:05.525500,Jennifer,Can an `collections.OrderedDict()` have entries with the same index?
94,2019-01-07T15:10:17.526700,Jennifer,Ah... I'm trying to use pyyaml to create e configuration file.
94,2019-01-07T15:10:21.526900,Jennifer,"```
# Example file - GOAL
#- targets:
#       - 172.17.0.2:9180
#  labels:
#       cluster: cluster1
#       dc: dc1
#- targets:
#       - 172.17.0.3:9180
#  labels:
#       cluster: cluster1```"
94,2019-01-07T15:10:35.527600,Jennifer,And I passa an OrderedDict to the yaml.dump
94,2019-01-07T15:10:43.527800,Violeta,is it okay that I have my django proj and virtual env under the same directory?
94,2019-01-07T15:10:58.528200,Jennifer,I guess I can write more than once to the file using a loop.
94,2019-01-07T15:11:33.528900,Jennifer,"Appending to the file, I mean."
94,2019-01-07T15:11:33.529000,Clemmie,Or make it a nested dict <@Jennifer>
94,2019-01-07T15:11:50.529600,Jennifer,"Note that ""targets"" is repeated there."
94,2019-01-07T15:12:00.530000,Jennifer,And it is on the same level.
94,2019-01-07T15:12:30.530900,Jennifer,So it would need to have the same key.
94,2019-01-07T15:12:45.531400,Jennifer,Correct me if I'm wrong.
94,2019-01-07T15:12:56.531700,Clemmie,"Yeah `{""targets"": [{""labels"":{""cluster"": ""cluster1"", ""dc"":""dc1""}},}` etc..."
94,2019-01-07T15:13:28.532300,Clemmie,"Oh, if you require that structure, then yeah, you want a list of dicts"
94,2019-01-07T15:13:55.533000,Jennifer,List of dicts or append to the file. I'm using loops anyway.
94,2019-01-07T15:14:04.533600,Jennifer,"Thanks, misthop!"
94,2019-01-07T15:14:13.533900,Clemmie,yw
94,2019-01-07T15:16:59.534700,Jennifer,"One more thing. Can my dict contain a list as a value?
In the example you gave above: `{""targets"": [""172.17.0.1:9180"", ""172.17.0.2:9180""], {{""labels"":{""cluster"": ""cluster1"", ""dc"":""dc1""}},}`"
94,2019-01-07T15:17:11.534900,Shan,yup
94,2019-01-07T15:17:16.535100,Jennifer,Awesome.
94,2019-01-07T15:17:28.535500,Jennifer,"Btw, this is the best Slack ever. Thanks, guys!"
94,2019-01-07T15:20:16.536800,Ashley,"for reference, anything that can be “hashed” can be a key in a dictionary, and literally anything (assuming it’s an object, and not something like a keyword) can be a value"
94,2019-01-07T15:21:00.537600,Kiera,"<@Jennifer> your yaml file does not have duplicate keys.  it's got a list of dictionaries, where those dictionaries have some keys in common - but no one dictionary has duplicate keys."
94,2019-01-07T15:22:04.538300,Kiera,"```
[
    { ""targets"": …, ""labels"": { … } },
    { ""targets"": …, ""labels"": { … } },
]
```"
94,2019-01-07T15:26:54.539900,Maricela,I have two different servers that have different pip packages and different versions of packages. I want one server to match what I have on the other server. Is it safe to remove all packages on the target server and install with requirements.txt file from the source server?
94,2019-01-07T15:27:11.540200,Maricela,The code on both will be the same
94,2019-01-07T15:27:46.541000,Clemmie,Not the best practice. Most OS have system python and will depend on some of the installed packages. Use virtual environments
94,2019-01-07T15:28:33.541700,Clemmie,"In particular, I’m pretty sure you will destroy an OS X install doing that"
94,2019-01-07T15:29:01.542600,Kiera,"or centos/redhat/etc.  if you try to remove the python packages, you'll remove `yum`."
94,2019-01-07T15:29:12.542700,Maricela,Good to know. Thanks.
94,2019-01-07T15:45:54.543400,Maricela,"Alternatively, if I ran the requirements.txt would it overwrite any existing packages or install only the ones missing?"
94,2019-01-07T15:47:04.544600,Clemmie,It could replace with different versions - also not a good result. You really want to keep your system python and app python environments separate
94,2019-01-07T15:47:53.545400,Maricela,Ok. Looks like I need to start migrating things to a virtualenv.
94,2019-01-07T15:48:06.545700,Maricela,thank you
94,2019-01-07T15:49:02.546800,Clemmie,"Very little to migrate. Create a virtualenv in your preferred way (mkvirtualenv, pyenv, venv, etc.) Activate the env, pip install, and then run as you would"
94,2019-01-07T15:50:23.547200,Maricela,So I wouldn't have to move my django project into that venv?
94,2019-01-07T15:51:41.548400,Clemmie,"Nope. In fact that is an anti-pattern. Having an activated virtual env basically changes your python path to the virtual env from system python, and installs packages in the virtual env’s file structure."
94,2019-01-07T15:53:17.548800,Maricela,Nice. I'll get started on that then. Thanks again.
94,2019-01-07T15:53:46.549000,Clemmie,np

95,2019-01-07T16:28:03.552900,Shan,no they werent.

My earlier statement was pure sarcasm. I gotta get better that stuff..."
95,2019-01-07T16:29:42.555200,Shan,oh. im sure it was but they arent even worth the sarcasm. =P

95,2019-01-07T16:29:57.555700,Shan,"apparently, they are gone again."
95,2019-01-07T16:30:36.556200,Shan,"like, i realize that i was brash, but i definitely answered his question before i laid into, be a better human because you currently suck."
95,2019-01-07T16:31:53.557100,Clint,He is definitely an...... interesting individual lol
95,2019-01-07T16:32:23.557600,Shan,sounds like `/r/iamverysmart` is leaking
95,2019-01-07T16:33:51.559100,Karoline,"Yeah they have been deactivated.  I honestly am not 100% up to speed on what transpired yesterday, but they've been deactivated once, coming back just to troll isn't going to fly."
95,2019-01-07T16:34:15.559400,Clemmie,Sounds like weekends around here get a little crazy
95,2019-01-07T16:34:26.559700,Karoline,"Ha, apparently"
95,2019-01-07T16:34:31.559900,Hiroko,"not really, its been fairly drama-free"
95,2019-01-07T16:34:39.560200,Hiroko,though we do tend to attract ocassional trolls
95,2019-01-07T16:34:55.560800,Karoline,yeah in general it's been quite peaceful recently.
95,2019-01-07T16:35:01.560900,Hiroko,and slack is significantly lacking as far as providing quality tools for admins
95,2019-01-07T16:35:14.561500,Hiroko,so we rely on the community for reports for when we’re not around
95,2019-01-07T16:35:28.562100,Hiroko,or in those channels we’re not active in
95,2019-01-07T16:35:36.562500,Shan,"tbf, he asked for some fun and easy things to learn programming."
95,2019-01-07T16:36:07.563700,Shan,"they was given answers, and then they devolved into talking shit about UI/UX and how when they learn to program they are going to fix it all"
95,2019-01-07T16:36:18.564100,Shan,and were all dumb.
95,2019-01-07T16:36:30.564400,Clint,"I just find it funny, with him slamming into me :slightly_smiling_face: saying I do not know what I am talking about, I have taught over a hundred dev who currently work in industry, so I thought I could help him yesterday and man was that a response he sent back lol"
95,2019-01-07T16:37:26.565300,Clemmie,Dunning-Kruger ftw!
95,2019-01-07T16:37:52.565800,Shan,i feel like its that guy that kept posting sexual furries that comes in and gets banned.
95,2019-01-07T16:37:56.565900,Clint,Been teaching intro development in ruby and then python for three years lol
95,2019-01-07T16:38:46.566700,Ashley,"I was confused, and then did a search for xoxo, and holy shit"
95,2019-01-07T16:42:23.567900,Karoline,I wouldn't be shocked if this person comes back and starts hassling people directly.  Feel free to use `/admin` to message the admin team to let them know if that happens.
95,2019-01-07T16:48:48.568700,Ashley,somebody should definitely post some of those quotes to /r/iamverysmart
95,2019-01-07T17:08:38.570300,Ashley,<@Javier> you can search for stuff from @xoxo
95,2019-01-07T17:24:14.571300,Javier,"Rofl, straight out of bronze that one is"
95,2019-01-07T17:26:34.571800,Shan,"&gt; All of the aforementioned are all _UX/UI_ problems with software, &amp; I’ll be the person to fix/make better all this broken garbge if I ever learn coding

still my favorite line outta the whole ordeal."

The above link get updated every 5 min
I have exported the data from the link to pandas dataframe and from DataFrame to database using sqlalchemy.
I want the data to be updated to the database and this time it should only enter the latest data not the entire data(Every 5 min one row)
I have taken data in two tables in the database and then I am merging
```INSERT INTO customers1 SELECT * FROM customers WHERE (SELECT date from customers) != (SELECT date from customers1);```
Is there any way to update the single database from pandas to sqlite database?"
101,2019-01-08T01:18:08.581400,Chad,Yes but again 100 I need to save it into other temp database and then merge
101,2019-01-08T01:19:02.582200,Chad,Is there any way i can save the data from pandas to database without `dataframe.to_sql`
101,2019-01-08T01:19:06.582400,Chad,?
101,2019-01-08T01:28:31.583700,Sasha,"Well, I mean you could use a different database API, but within the pandas framework, it looks like `to_sql()` is the main method. You can use it to append to an existing table, though, with `if_exists='append'`."
101,2019-01-08T01:38:56.584800,Chad,`if_exists=append` is add the same data i.e if the data has 1135 rows after `append` it is showing 2270 rows
101,2019-01-08T01:41:07.585700,Sasha,"Ah, in that case you probably want to filter your dataframe first, such as only keeping any points whose timestamp is greater than the maximum one already in the database."
101,2019-01-08T01:43:00.586000,Chad,can you please tell me how ?
101,2019-01-08T01:43:06.586200,Chad,I didnot get
101,2019-01-08T01:50:02.588500,Sasha,"Well, you could get the maximum timestamp in the database with a `SELECT MAX(date_column)` query. And then use Pandas to select that data: `data[data['date_column'] &gt; max_date]`."
101,2019-01-08T03:19:57.589600,Chad,oh Great I think this will work

103,2019-01-08T04:23:38.592900,Conchita,"Hope this is clear. What would be the most pythonic solution to returning data out of this method?

I have a MongoDB that contains simple data of bank accounts including historical balances. The data is structured like this:

```_id:""3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r""
balances: 
    0:
    balance: 138661
    date: 2018-11-06 08:00:00.000

    1:
    balance: 138660
    date: 2018-11-07 08:00:00.000```

My goal here is to count how many accounts are increasing their account balance, decreasing  their account balance or neither during a given period, to compute the share between them.

When I run the code below, I get ```{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 0, 'idle': 1}
{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 1, 'idle': 0}
{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 0, 'idle': 1}
{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 1, 'idle': 0}
{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 0, 'idle': 1}
{'increasing': 0, 'decreasing': 0, 'idle': 1}```"
103,2019-01-08T04:25:56.594000,Conchita,"I'm unsure if I should store this in a dict, in pandas etc"
103,2019-01-08T04:26:08.594500,Conchita,It's my first go at interacting with MongoDB
103,2019-01-08T04:26:15.594600,Jimmy,imo you kind of have the correct idea but it's a the wrong place
103,2019-01-08T04:26:49.595200,Jimmy,what I would do is have `classify_activity` return one of `increasing` `decreasing` or `idle`
103,2019-01-08T04:27:24.595800,Jimmy,and in your loop over each account (in the bottom) increment the corresponding counter
103,2019-01-08T04:28:15.596200,Jimmy,does that makes sense ?
103,2019-01-08T04:30:34.596900,Conchita,Does make sense. But I'm a bit unsure how to pull it off. I modified my method like this
103,2019-01-08T04:31:11.597900,Conchita,What I'm confused about now is how to check the return value?
103,2019-01-08T04:31:48.598700,Jimmy,"&gt; What I'm confused about now is how to check the return value?

You can't because in this case they are all the same"
103,2019-01-08T04:31:58.599000,Jimmy,you have to find a way to make them different
103,2019-01-08T04:32:16.599500,Jimmy,the simple way is just to return a different string for each condition
103,2019-01-08T04:32:29.600000,Conchita,Aha! Of course
103,2019-01-08T04:33:08.600800,Jimmy,the best is to return the exact string that you use as key in your counter so you can do
103,2019-01-08T04:33:24.601200,Jimmy,"```
x = classify()
my_counter[x] += 1
```"
103,2019-01-08T04:39:57.601500,Conchita,I was a little confused about the way you set up `my_counter[x] += 1` so I tried the solution below which seemed to do the trick. Would be great if you could have a look <@Jimmy>
103,2019-01-08T04:40:18.602100,Conchita,"It returned the output ```{'increasing': 4, 'decreasing': 2, 'idle': 0}``` which is correct"
103,2019-01-08T04:40:30.602500,Jimmy,nice :thumbsup:
103,2019-01-08T04:40:54.603100,Jimmy,in your case you are running `run.classify_activity()` 3 times for each account
103,2019-01-08T04:40:58.603300,Jimmy,and that's not really necessary
103,2019-01-08T04:41:06.603700,Conchita,Oh don't wanna do that
103,2019-01-08T04:41:13.603900,Jimmy,you could store that in a variable and compare afterwards
103,2019-01-08T04:42:47.605400,Conchita,How can I check the string returned from the method without running it unnecessary like I currently do?
103,2019-01-08T04:43:14.605900,Jimmy,like you would do for any return value / variable
103,2019-01-08T04:43:40.606500,Jimmy,"```
activity = run.classify_activity()
if activity == ""increasing"":
  ...
```"
103,2019-01-08T04:44:28.606800,Conchita,Of course :slightly_smiling_face:

103,2019-01-08T04:46:37.609300,Jimmy,One more thing in the example you showed the `else` is also incrementing `increasing` where it should be `idle`

110,2019-01-08T15:54:52.665400,Clemmie,<@Candi> You should at opening that with a context manager (`with`) or make sure to do `file.close()`. The context manager is the better way to go. <https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/with-statement-in-python>

113,2019-01-08T20:22:23.680300,Ardath,None
113,2019-01-08T20:22:54.681000,Ardath,Can anyone think of a solution?
113,2019-01-08T20:25:15.682600,Shan,convert `Q()` to an attr?
113,2019-01-08T20:25:24.683000,Ardath,Struggling to find what I need in the docs
113,2019-01-08T20:27:28.684400,Shan,"`db_query = ""Q(""brand_names""='AMD') | Q(""brand_names""='Intel')""`"
113,2019-01-08T20:29:10.684800,Ardath,<@Shan> Not sure I'm with you
113,2019-01-08T20:29:43.685800,Ardath,Should probably add `Q` is imported from mongoengine
113,2019-01-08T20:29:56.686100,Shan,your first post shows that `Q` is an object.
113,2019-01-08T20:30:13.686300,Shan,db_query has no objects.
113,2019-01-08T20:31:21.687800,Ardath,Trying to think about how to query the db dynamically
113,2019-01-08T20:31:35.688300,Ardath,"With random k, v's coming in from requests"
113,2019-01-08T20:31:56.688700,Shan,im not familiar with your library but `getattr` _may_ work.
113,2019-01-08T20:32:43.689000,Shan,youre using `mongoengine`?
113,2019-01-08T20:33:06.689500,Ardath,"yeah mongoengine, latest"
113,2019-01-08T20:34:00.689900,Shan,:facepalm: `from mongoengine import *`
113,2019-01-08T20:34:32.690400,Sasha,So you may need to play a `**kwargs` trick with creating `Q()` objects from dynamic parameters.
113,2019-01-08T20:35:00.690700,Ardath,<@Shan> Everything is imported haha
113,2019-01-08T20:35:14.691200,Ardath,Just not included in the snippet
113,2019-01-08T20:35:16.691300,Shan,"yea, their tutorial is garbage like that."
113,2019-01-08T20:36:19.692400,Ardath,<@Sasha> yeah that's what I'm trying to work out
113,2019-01-08T20:37:02.693000,Ardath,There's got to be a better way
113,2019-01-08T20:37:18.693400,Shan,"so first, `query.append(f""Q({k}='{x}')"")` you’ll need to ensure `Q()` is an object…right now its a string."
113,2019-01-08T20:37:37.693600,Ardath,basically yes
113,2019-01-08T20:37:58.694000,Ardath,and each `Q` needs to be separated with a `|`
113,2019-01-08T20:38:23.694300,Shan,<http://docs.mongoengine.org/guide/querying.html#querying-lists>
113,2019-01-08T20:38:55.694500,Sasha,"There may be an easier way to do this if there's a ""blank Q"" object to start with. Or maybe do a reduce with operator-OR."
113,2019-01-08T20:39:54.695000,Shan,:taco: <@Sasha> for functional
113,2019-01-08T20:41:59.696200,Sasha,There's also apparently a `__raw__=` syntax for giving a query as a dict in PyMongo format.
113,2019-01-08T20:41:59.696300,Ardath,Thank Ed I'll try something like that now
113,2019-01-08T20:42:46.696900,Sasha,So `Q(__raw__={k: x})` may work instead of the `**kwargs` hack.
113,2019-01-08T20:43:38.697600,Sasha,This is a case of an API trying to be a bit too clever in blending in with language features...
113,2019-01-08T20:43:41.697700,Ardath,Dude I think you cracked it

115,2019-01-08T22:33:12.703200,Brittanie,which python version are you on ?
115,2019-01-08T22:33:17.703400,Shan,you tell us.

115,2019-01-08T22:41:36.708400,Brittanie,rounding
115,2019-01-08T22:41:44.708700,Brittanie,looks like rounding doesn’t work for decimal

115,2019-01-08T22:47:05.710500,Shan,"oh yea.  reading more into `Decimal`, looks like you can round twith that."
116,2019-01-08T22:55:57.710600,Conchita,"I have a MongoDB document structure like below and I want to find the `balance` value that belongs in the same array object as `date` value x. Ie I want to find what the balance was at 2018-11-06.

116,2019-01-08T22:56:16.711000,Conchita,What am I missing here?
116,2019-01-08T22:58:29.711400,Sasha,Are the dates in the database stored as strings or as datetime objects?
116,2019-01-08T22:58:43.711700,Conchita,datetime objects
116,2019-01-08T22:59:12.712200,Sasha,So you probably have to compare them to a datetime object in your query.
116,2019-01-08T22:59:33.712400,Conchita,Could you give me an example?
116,2019-01-08T23:00:06.713000,Sasha,"When you say `== self.date`, that should be a datetime, not a string you're currently passing in."
116,2019-01-08T23:01:22.713700,Conchita,"Got it, will figure out how to pass a datetime"
116,2019-01-08T23:02:07.714400,Sasha,"`strptime()` is your friend if you want to start from strings, but you can also construct a datetime from numbers."
116,2019-01-08T23:03:32.714900,Conchita,Which of the two methods do you prefer?
116,2019-01-08T23:05:09.715600,Sasha,No strong preference. Ideally you would be getting them from some other database query rather than needing to construct them from scratch.
116,2019-01-08T23:07:05.717100,Conchita,"Ok, noted! Thanks for the advice"
116,2019-01-08T23:07:32.717300,Stacy,`strptime()` can have performance implications as well if parsing lots of data vs creating your own solution.
116,2019-01-09T01:01:37.719700,Valeri,2 sets?
117,2019-01-08T23:45:55.717600,Conchita,"I got a datetime object here, but why is it returning ```2018-11-06 08:00:00
``` and not adding the fractional seconds when I have included `%f`?"
117,2019-01-08T23:57:21.718700,Sasha,"Probably just the default print format for the object. It doesn't remember what your string looked like, but you can format it however you like with `strftime()`."
118,2019-01-09T00:53:02.719200,Conchita,What am I doing wrong here? I get 2 sets of fractional seconds..
118,2019-01-09T01:03:13.720900,Conchita,"If you compare the first line `date = '2018-11-06 08:00:00.000`
 with the last line you can see what I mean `2018-11-06 08:00:00.000000`"
118,2019-01-09T01:03:53.721600,Conchita,The strftime generates exta `000`

119,2019-01-09T02:07:42.723400,Shan,the docs state that `%f` is int(6)
119,2019-01-09T02:08:52.724200,Shan,"but i’m curious as to why this happens: ```&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; date = '2018-11-06 08:00:00.000'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = datetime.strptime(date, ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"")
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = datetime.strftime(x, ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"")

```"
119,2019-01-09T02:10:35.724700,Shan,"however, you can just do a bit of list slicing."
119,2019-01-09T02:10:54.725300,Valeri,Something as simple as this would give you what you need
119,2019-01-09T02:11:45.726200,Shan,"so, is `[:-3]` a good idea?"
119,2019-01-09T02:11:52.726600,Shan,instead of `[:23]` ?
119,2019-01-09T02:12:37.726800,Shan,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; y = datetime.strftime(x, ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"")[:23]

2018-11-06 08:00:00.000```"
119,2019-01-09T02:13:16.727700,Valeri,Given that the standard of data here i.e. y is pretty definite
119,2019-01-09T02:13:36.728200,Valeri,both the options should be good enough
119,2019-01-09T02:13:48.728500,Valeri,<@Shan> What do you have in mind?
119,2019-01-09T02:14:11.728900,Valeri,"<@Conchita>

119,2019-01-09T02:18:21.729700,Valeri,Yeah right
119,2019-01-09T02:21:32.730800,Valeri,"<@Conchita> You can actually enforce a check saying whether the `datetime.strftime(x, ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"")[:-3]` equals `datetime.strftime(x, ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f"")[:23]` and then write to the db"

123,2019-01-09T06:33:58.750300,Valeri,Why are you using `json.dumps()`?
123,2019-01-09T06:34:25.750800,Valeri,What does `cur.fetchall()` give you?
123,2019-01-09T06:35:09.751800,Conchita,"<@Valeri> <@Shan> sorry, I gave you the wrong information. `2018-11-06 08:00:00.000` is string type. I need to pass a datetime and whenever I try to convert `date = '2018-11-06 08:00:00.000'` to a datetime I get `2018-11-06 08:00:00`. When I (think I) need to match exactly my original string format `2018-11-06 08:00:00.000`. My issue is turning that to a datetime object without loosing anything.

My goal here is to query data inside a MongoDB array object, where I first find a specific `_id`, then find the specific object through querying for a specific `date`. ie. I want to find the balance of array object 1 here ```_id:""3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r""
balances: 
    0:
    balance: 138661
    date: 2018-11-06 08:00:00.000

    1:
    balance: 8660
    date: 2018-11-07 08:00:00.000```"
123,2019-01-09T06:35:10.751900,Valeri,"I don't think Pandas is needed, Data here is very simple to involve such a huge libraty"
123,2019-01-09T06:37:04.753800,Conchita,"Could I do a workaround here and do a ""partial"" query. Ie find any document that has part of what I am passing, and not exactly what I pass? Like `2018-11-06 08:00:00` would also match when trying to find the value `2018-11-06 08:00:00.000`?"
123,2019-01-09T06:37:23.754000,Conchita,`.000` is the difference here
123,2019-01-09T06:38:50.754300,Sharolyn,cur.fetchall() gave me above text

123,2019-01-09T07:21:09.772100,Conchita,"Yeah will be 40 collections each with 2000 documents, where each document have 300 sub-documents (stored in array)"
123,2019-01-09T07:27:32.772500,Chester,"""A lot of records"" is a fine reason if you're exceeding terrabytes.
40 collections * 2000 documents * 300 sub-documents is just 23 megabytes assuming each document is exactly 1 byte. If each document is around 1kb, then you'll need only 23gb to store everything. Let's add 50% more storage for indexes: 35 GB.
If you have just one 1 TB disk, you're in capacity of storing almost 30 times of the data you have now."

131,2019-01-09T13:28:51.795500,Hiroko,very.
131,2019-01-09T13:29:22.796100,Hiroko,"I’d start reading about how parsing and tokenization work, then structuring your schema for indexing"
131,2019-01-09T13:30:00.796500,Hiroko,"that said, a week is very tight and I’d push for a bigger time range"
131,2019-01-09T13:30:32.797300,Hiroko,"its very easy to get in the mindset “well, google does this crap easily” and forget just what it takes to have good search experience"

131,2019-01-09T13:48:00.809500,Valeri,Yes
131,2019-01-09T13:48:33.810300,Valeri,It's basically details about newspapers
131,2019-01-09T13:49:25.811300,Valeri,I've to migrate all that data to an Elasticsearch db and then build a search service on top of it using Python/Django
131,2019-01-09T13:49:56.811900,Valeri,Which will be consumed by the FE using REST APIs
131,2019-01-09T13:49:59.812000,Hiroko,in a _week_?
131,2019-01-09T13:50:05.812200,Valeri,Nope
131,2019-01-09T13:50:24.812600,Valeri,One week is for me to get familiarized with Elastic search
131,2019-01-09T13:50:47.813100,Valeri,So that I'm able to decide initially what my models would look like
131,2019-01-09T13:51:15.814000,Valeri,Followed by schema migrations and data migrations
131,2019-01-09T13:51:46.814600,Valeri,Then I commence work on the search service
131,2019-01-09T13:52:07.815100,Valeri,I will be working with other people after the data has been migrated
131,2019-01-09T13:52:19.815400,Valeri,But I'm on my own for the first two steps at least
131,2019-01-09T13:58:47.815900,Shan,sounds like a rollercoaster adventure.
131,2019-01-09T14:01:18.818200,Shan,"as you get comfortable, i’d start researching topics on how to properly structure your schema to get the best performance for your data."
131,2019-01-09T14:01:38.818700,Shan,implement a new schema and play with that while using data.
131,2019-01-09T14:04:55.818900,Shan,id start with that anyways
132,2019-01-09T13:43:33.806400,Valeri,"So, where do I begin guys?"
132,2019-01-09T13:45:37.807100,Shan,well whats your requirement?
132,2019-01-09T13:46:12.807700,Sasha,Heh. Lots of people end up using Google-scale technology for tiny amounts of simple data. Hopefully whoever made the Elasticsearch decision knows what they're doing...
132,2019-01-09T13:47:44.809000,Shan,do you know what that data is?
132,2019-01-09T14:00:49.817600,Shan,"so, id first stand up a service.  go through the aws getting started pages.  <https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/getting-started/> : look at your data and implement a schema that you think may work.  load up some data and test it out. play with it."
132,2019-01-09T14:06:08.819400,Shan,<@Leopoldo> your `search` arg is outside of a defined loop.
132,2019-01-09T14:07:20.821300,Leopoldo,Thank you <@Shan> I’ll make that change.
132,2019-01-09T14:10:00.823100,Shan,```Currently I am having to have my system save the directory file location as a text input so that the system will know upon launch what to load.``` elaborate further plz
133,2019-01-09T13:59:27.816500,Leopoldo,"Hi all, can anyone weigh in on how I’ve got this structured? I can successfully choose a user, then loop through every event as that one user.. But I want it x =+ 1 when it’s done there, and start the process over with a new user name. I have my full script too, but I thought simplifying it might make discussion easier."
133,2019-01-09T14:08:42.822800,Nenita,"Needing some good input here, but I am having to learn new modules and methods as I work on whatever I am developing. Currently I am having to have my system save the directory file location as a text input so that the system will know upon launch what to load. The problem is that I am currently having to use an external file to let the system know what to load, but this won't work as I will have to hardcode the system to look for the first file to load the rest. What is a module that can save/cache the directory text so that I never have to save an external file. Also needing it to save the information even when I exit the program. Is there anyway to do this?"
133,2019-01-09T14:30:29.826800,Nenita,alright. Ill do my best
133,2019-01-09T14:30:37.827000,Nenita,to be specific.
133,2019-01-09T14:32:54.829600,Nenita,"I have designed and pretty much finished a point system for the company i work with. all the information is stored in a dataframe which is then saved as a pickle file so employees cannot edit the information (although they wouldnt know how necessarily). Everything saves and loads just fine, but knowing I will be putting this on currently 8 company computers, I don't want to have to hardcode the save location everytime for the pickle file. So I made a simple entry for the saved/loaded pickle file. The problem is that it is impossible at the moment for the program, upon launch, to know what to load without hardcoding it."
133,2019-01-09T14:37:09.830500,Jettie,"this way the directory itself may be different on different computers, but the file will still be easily found"
134,2019-01-09T14:36:49.829900,Jettie,it can look in the same directory the program is in
135,2019-01-09T15:31:45.832500,Candi,Hello guys I cannot make out difference between input and raw_input is it python version specific thing?
135,2019-01-09T15:32:36.832900,Sasha,It is. They changed the behavior between 2 and 3.
135,2019-01-09T15:33:35.833800,Candi,so it is same for python 3 or only input() exists now
135,2019-01-09T15:35:45.834600,Sasha,"`input()` in 3 does what `raw_input()` used to do in 2, and there's no separate `raw_input()` any more."
135,2019-01-09T15:38:26.835600,Sasha,"Basically they concluded that the old `input()`, which evaluated the data as a Python expression, was just a bad idea."
135,2019-01-09T15:55:16.836200,Nenita,sorry for the late response. was in a meeting.
135,2019-01-09T15:55:31.836400,Nenita,<@Jettie> you are my hero
135,2019-01-09T16:18:43.837100,Candi,<@Sasha> got it thank you
136,2019-01-09T19:09:21.838500,Maricruz,"What do you guys use to show progress for long running operations in Python? I've been using `tqdm` and love it, but on my server the carriage return doesn't work or something and makes my logs just full of these waterfall-looking progress bars haha"

136,2019-01-09T19:56:20.842100,Maricruz,"<@Bethany> think it has something to do with this line in `_tqdm.py` and the `\r` not working on linux? or something? I don't know much about it:

136,2019-01-09T19:57:24.842600,Bethany,wait that function returns itself?
137,2019-01-09T20:02:56.843000,Kiera,"probably so you can do `print_status(""foo"")(""bar"")(""baz"")` - neat idea"
137,2019-01-09T20:03:13.843200,Kiera,"not sure how practical it is, but neat idea :)"

I've got a sample database I'd like to run some queries on (super basic stuff for now) but without knowing what tables (and columns in that table) are available, it's tough to create the actual query.  Looking for tools that allows me to browse the schema/tables/rows.  Ideally something free.  I'm on Win10 and I've created an ODBC connection and I've used that in Access to do a little of what I'm trying to do, but was hoping for a tool that would let me dive a bit deeper into the schema, maybe filter out empty tables (or at least report which ones are) and have a few more tools for dev?"
139,2019-01-09T22:03:43.853100,Lean,Postico is free for macOS

140,2019-01-09T22:52:51.861700,Clemmie,"if you can find pgAdmin3 use it. It is _much_ better than 4, and should support an old postgres install <@Marth>"

144,2019-01-10T03:50:02.875500,Jimmy,that's what tox does
145,2019-01-10T03:33:45.872300,Jung,"Hello everyone.
Do you know why some projects to use tox?
I'm a newbie and not understand why need tox and why not use simple virtual environment."
145,2019-01-10T03:36:40.873200,Jung,"2.7, 3.5, etc?"
145,2019-01-10T03:36:48.873500,Jimmy,"for example if you develop a library that support python &gt;3.5 you want to run tests on 3.5, 3.6, 3.7"
145,2019-01-10T03:39:27.873900,Jung,"Ok. And how to contributing to a library for this case?
For example, I see on Github library for python 2.7 and 3.6
I want to fix the code.
What I need first?
To create a virtual environment with 2.7, second v.e. with 3.6?
Or not?"
145,2019-01-10T03:41:53.874500,Jimmy,I think in that case I would work in a 2.7 environment
145,2019-01-10T03:42:00.874800,Jimmy,and use tox to tests other version

Thanks! <@Jimmy> :taco:"
145,2019-01-10T03:50:31.876000,Jimmy,it automagically creates a virtual env for all thoses versions and run tests in those
145,2019-01-10T03:57:32.876200,Jung,"It's easy.
If I right understand

```
tox -e py27
```
Run all tests for Python 2.7

```
tox
```
Run all tests for all versions.

```
tox -e py27 name_folder/model_test.py
```
Run tests only from this file.
Right? <@Jimmy>"

I create a test for python2.7 and I want to create a test for this part of code for Python3.7

149,2019-01-10T09:08:25.897900,Ashley,"For a more detailed explanation, <@Keva>, in Python, `is` is the same thing as `===` in other languages. Instead of just checking equal value of the two objects, it checks that they are literally the same object. So if you say `jp.data['additional_info'] is dict`, you're asking if `jp.data['additional_data']` is literally _the_ `dict` class. But an instance of a class is not the same object as the class itself"

149,2019-01-10T09:36:36.911300,Lydia,Just a note... The folks over at Instagram are trying to do away with  duck typing because it becomes unmaintainable over time when  trying to evaluate what a function return should do
150,2019-01-10T09:11:17.899600,Yaeko,"Adding to this, using `is` for short strings or low ints is not good unless you know what you are doing. Since Python caches (correct term?) these object two short strings will point to the same object and therefore will be identical using `is` while two long strings will not be cached and not be identical with `is` even though they might be the same string."
150,2019-01-10T09:11:25.899800,Yaeko,if the rambling makes any sense
150,2019-01-10T09:16:59.900400,Ardath,Think I found a solution using the mongoengine `__raw__` query param
150,2019-01-10T09:17:19.900500,Ardath,None
150,2019-01-10T09:25:29.906400,Clemmie,"<@Sallie> it looks like no one answered your question. method overloading (including constructors) is not supported in python. That said, default values lets you do pretty much the same thing, as overloading is almost always used to allow for various sets of defaults. In your case it looks like you want
```
def __init__(self, name=""Mike"", age=29):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
```
Any values provided when the constructor is called will be used, but if it is missing the default is used. you could call this in the following ways
```
&gt; t = Test()
&lt;name ""Mike"" , age 29&gt;

&gt; t = Test(name=""Bob"")
&lt;name ""Bob"" , age 29&gt;

&gt; t = Test(age = 17)
&lt;name ""Mike"" , age 17&gt;

&gt; t = Test(name=""Bob"", age=17)
&lt;name ""Bob"" , age  17&gt;
```"
150,2019-01-10T09:27:45.907100,Sallie,Thanks for your support :slightly_smiling_face:
150,2019-01-10T09:34:35.910000,Ouida,"<@Keva> just saying, that in Python, usually, you should aim for what's called *duck typing*.
&gt; if it walks like a duck, looks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it's probably a duck
in other words, you should usually just try to do what you are trying to do, and if you think that there are other possibilities, just use `try-catch` and handle other cases. if you have too many different cases, and something can have multiple different behaviors, your design might be flawed."
151,2019-01-10T09:35:51.911000,Clemmie,<@Jimmy> is there a sir_botalot integration for reminding that tacos are the coin of the realm?
151,2019-01-10T09:38:12.912100,Jimmy,there is not. If you have a good idea for one we can add that
151,2019-01-10T09:38:51.913400,Lydia,Anyone have a working set of code that opens a RotatingFileHandler log but also allows me to add the stderr and stdout streams to that file handler?
151,2019-01-10T09:38:57.913600,Clemmie,"Not really, I have to dig into sir-bot-a-lot. Does it scan for keywords, or is it user triggered, or something else?"
151,2019-01-10T09:39:43.914100,Jimmy,it regex on the messages and also support `/` commands. so both
151,2019-01-10T09:39:55.914200,Clemmie,"Can you elaborate or link to a discussion? That sound like something to handle with mypy, duck typing is pretty pythonic"
151,2019-01-10T09:40:05.914600,Clemmie,"ok, cool. Will take a look"
151,2019-01-10T09:40:10.914700,Ouida,"I'm referring mainly to using `isinstance` or otherwise conditioning on the object *type*. if you find yourself having to add multiple `if isinstance(obj, some_type)` excessively so it becomes unmaintainable, you have other problems. that's also hard to follow.
I haven't read any article they released about this topic (if you have one handy I would be happy to) but I'm guessing that in general they would try to avoid it when appropriate but not by using `isinstance`, but maybe modifying design."
151,2019-01-10T09:41:02.915000,Ouida,<@Clemmie> but could also be rather unreadable... I try to avoid but structuring my code properly. try :slightly_smiling_face:
151,2019-01-10T09:42:05.915400,Clemmie,"Oh, sure, ok."

151,2019-01-10T09:46:22.916200,Clemmie,"Thanks, i’ll check it out. <@Lydia> :taco:"
151,2019-01-10T09:46:45.916600,Lydia,The idea around it is that I shouldn't have to see what you are going to do with your return or even care enough to read through the many iterations of what your function could return.
151,2019-01-10T09:47:28.916800,Lydia,"It should be uniform and the same when it comes out at the end; just because you say duckBuilder doesn't mean you are guaranteeing duckCount int type as a return, or even duckName attribute as the return."
151,2019-01-10T09:49:33.917000,Keva,whats the difference between type hinting (avaiable since python 3.6) and mypy?
151,2019-01-10T09:49:39.917200,Keva,syntax is the same.
151,2019-01-10T09:50:39.917400,Ouida,"<@Lydia> *of course!!!* and that's what I said. you should avoid duck typing if you know what to expect. but if more than one kind of object is expected, duck typing is the pythonic way."
151,2019-01-10T09:50:51.917600,Ouida,and thanks for the links!
151,2019-01-10T09:51:23.918100,Lydia,TBH I wasn't aware of it and came across it one night when I was looking at someone else's code on Github so thought I'd share the love.
151,2019-01-10T09:51:26.918300,Ouida,<@Keva> mypy is the tool for running static analysis on your *typed* code
151,2019-01-10T09:53:21.918600,Ouida,"the type-hinting, which is part of the standard since 3.5, is just the type annotations (which you can reference in runtime if you really want to).
type-hinting is also available in earlier versions, but as comments, that `mypy` and even IDEs like PyCharm can understand."
151,2019-01-10T09:53:59.918800,Ouida,we use type-hinting wherever possible with Py2 and it helps a lot when working inside PyCharm because it provides intellisense based on these types.
151,2019-01-10T09:56:21.919000,Bethany,"if you must dispatch based on types, why not"
151,2019-01-10T09:56:21.919200,Bethany,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.singledispatch>
151,2019-01-10T09:59:05.919400,Ouida,"this is cool, but horrible in my opinion..."
151,2019-01-10T09:59:28.919600,Ouida,doing too much sorcery with Python makes the code very hard to read
151,2019-01-10T09:59:47.919800,Bethany,I can imagine a few cases where the behavior is desired. Never actually used the decorator myself
151,2019-01-10T10:00:23.920000,Bethany,tbh I'm not sure why you would do that over something like the following
151,2019-01-10T10:00:49.920200,Ouida,it wasn't ideal in C++ (template specialization - which most people aren't even aware of probably) and it isn't ideal now :slightly_smiling_face:
151,2019-01-10T10:01:58.920400,Bethany,I mostly see it for something like the following
151,2019-01-10T10:02:18.920600,Bethany,None
151,2019-01-10T10:03:11.921000,Ouida,"for dispatching you can always like: ```
disp = {
    dict: func_on_dict,
    list: func_on_list
}

def default_handler(obj, ...): pass

def dispatch(obj, *args, **kwargs):
    return disp.get(type(obj), default_handler)(*args, **kwargs)```"
151,2019-01-10T10:04:15.921200,Ouida,"yeah - not the end of the world, but still better than actually using `isinstance`.
but ok - this is maybe the only case..."
151,2019-01-10T11:50:24.923500,Hassan,"eg:
```
m = re.match(""^&lt;uuid&gt;.*$"", ""12345"")

151,2019-01-10T11:50:59.923900,Hassan,some docs suggest using `\g` but this is a lie :disappointed:

Not trying to distribute it to PyPI, it's for internal use at my company. The issue I'm having is that the package requires some user input for configuration that I need to store somewhere; currently they just get stored in a `config.ini` file in the package directory. I could of course have a script that generates this config file that they have to run before they install the package, and then the config file gets installed with the package, but that doesn't seem like the best solution. Any ideas?"

There doesn't seem to be any option or section of the toml file or anything that relates to saving private user info. Also doesn't really help with best practices for saving stuff like this (should it be saved in a user directory, and the package should just expect them to be there? or...)"
161,2019-01-10T19:02:48.009600,Shan,"If a program requires a config file to work properly, you should either provide a default one or build in functionality to create one with something like `$program init` which then prompts for input of various things. It should save to the current directory, a project directory, or within the homedir.  You would define that requirement."
161,2019-01-10T19:06:20.011800,Erich,"I see, so I could put the CLI for adding those config values in a name = main block and tell the user to run `python -m mypackage init` or something. edit: I think that requires a `__main__.py` but thats fine too."

161,2019-01-10T19:22:59.017500,Erich,I think this is fine; I'll create a `__main__.py` file which will start the CLI for generating the config. That way it can be used after installing the python library and can let you change the configs easily after the library is installed (say if your credentials change)

2. I enqueue `rq` jobs that do the request to API2 and the result can later be accessed through myAPI.

But how should I handle the api2-tokens in a reasonable way? As a proof-of-concept I passed them as arguments to the enqueued function, but then they end up in the Redis/logs/et c.

I cannot, obviously, hash them."

`if i == [""1"",""2"",""3"",""4"",""5"",""6"",""7"",""8"",""9"",""0"","" "",""!"",""@"",""#"",""$"", ""%""]:`
This checks if each letter is exactly equal to `[""1"",""2"",""3"",""4"",""5"",""6"",""7"",""8"",""9"",""0"","" "",""!"",""@"",""#"",""$"", ""%""]`.
Maybe you would rather see if each letter is *in* that list?

` i += alphabet`
Are you wanting to add the contents of `alphabet` onto each letter `i`, or the other way around? It seems that you are wanting to instead add each new letter `i` to `alphabet`.

If you are not yet familiar with the `set` data type, read section 5.4 on this link. It’s a way that you can shorten your function.

175,2019-01-11T23:48:40.094500,Demetrice,"I think i see what you're saying. So instead my if function should just test to see if i is a in the alphabet.

Basically the user in question belongs to a department but other users of the application don't need to have a relationship with a department.
187,2019-01-13T14:11:27.129400,Jamey,How do I model the different users? Should I have a different model for each kind of user or is there a way to model this while using one `User` model?
187,2019-01-13T14:14:37.130200,Yvette,i would create other model to that kind of user extending the existing one
187,2019-01-13T14:15:15.131100,Yvette,if not you will need to add lot of fields to the User model for each special case
187,2019-01-13T14:15:34.131500,Yvette,so the User model would become untidy and big
187,2019-01-13T14:15:37.131700,Yvette,(IMHO)
187,2019-01-13T14:22:31.133100,Jamey,Hmmm... True. That's what I'm going to do but the problem that Django creates tables for the base `User` model as well as the extensions of the `User` model which seems a little untidy to me.

190,2019-01-13T20:47:47.144000,Hiroko,"<@Clayton> if its a pandas method, you need the lib to use it"
190,2019-01-13T20:48:01.144400,Clayton,its not a pandas dataframe
190,2019-01-13T20:48:07.144700,Hiroko,or look for another lib with its implementation
190,2019-01-13T20:48:29.144900,Rodrick,yea
190,2019-01-13T20:48:37.145000,Clayton,thats what im trying to figure out. which python lib has that function ?
190,2019-01-13T20:50:54.146300,Sasha,"<@Clayton> How do you want to use `head()` outside of dataframes? I mean, it's similar to built-in list slicing."
190,2019-01-13T20:51:51.146400,Clayton,just want to minimize the print output

190,2019-01-13T20:59:08.146900,Sasha,"It looks like it's using numpy arrays here, so an array slice is probably the way to go."
190,2019-01-13T20:59:36.147100,Clayton,whats the syntax ?

190,2019-01-13T22:44:29.150600,Hiroko,"Also, this might be a better fit for <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science> "
191,2019-01-14T07:32:14.154100,Hassan,"does anyone here use `xlrd`?
I have a cell in a workbook `1234`, that has 0 decimal spaces (defined in cell formatting in excel) yet when I pull that value from the row, it is a string, but has decimal places `1234.0`"
191,2019-01-14T07:32:39.154700,Hassan,is there any way to make `xlrd` honour the formatting rules defined?

192,2019-01-14T08:23:07.157900,Gemma,I've run into this issue too and I think by default Excel  treats all numbers as floats. 
193,2019-01-14T10:14:52.159100,Gemma,That is to say that it's probably not an xlrd issue and you'll probably have to convert after the read in.
193,2019-01-14T10:14:56.159400,Rodrick,is there a way to install python 2.7 sepreatly with pip?
193,2019-01-14T10:15:14.159800,Rodrick,separately
193,2019-01-14T10:15:27.160000,Mica,what platform are you on?
193,2019-01-14T10:18:01.162000,Ashley,"<@Rodrick> it’s recommended that you use a virtual environment. You can install python 2.7 normally, and then create a virtual environment that clones your python 2.7 executable. It will become its own environment with its own set of installed packages, and its own `pip` that will install to that environment. Then you can just activate that env whenever you want to work in it"
193,2019-01-14T10:22:13.162300,Rodrick,<@Clarisa> i am on windows
193,2019-01-14T10:22:49.162800,Rodrick,<@Ashley> how do i create a virtual env
193,2019-01-14T10:22:56.163100,Rodrick,i havent done that before
193,2019-01-14T10:22:59.163300,Ashley,no worries
193,2019-01-14T10:23:05.163500,Ashley,it’s actually pretty easy
193,2019-01-14T10:23:08.163700,Rodrick,ok
193,2019-01-14T10:23:43.164300,Ashley,"you can just run `pip install virtualenv`, and that will give you a tool to do it"
193,2019-01-14T10:23:44.164400,Rodrick,i have python 3.6 installed rn
193,2019-01-14T10:23:54.164600,Rodrick,ok
193,2019-01-14T10:24:30.165200,Ashley,"I prefer to use `virtualenvwrapper` as well, and it looks like there’s a specific version for windows"
193,2019-01-14T10:24:37.165500,Ashley,`virtualenvwrapper-win`
193,2019-01-14T10:24:59.166200,Rodrick,ok i just did that command and the reqierment had already been satisfied
193,2019-01-14T10:25:20.166800,Ashley,"you’ll be making several virtual environments, so you’ll want to create a folder in a specific location to hold all your virtual envs"
193,2019-01-14T10:25:27.167100,Rodrick,how can I launch the tool
193,2019-01-14T10:25:36.167400,Ashley,(you always want to work in a virtual environment)
193,2019-01-14T10:25:37.167500,Rodrick,"Ok, done"
193,2019-01-14T10:27:27.168100,Ashley,"if you run `pip install virtualenvwrapper-win`, it should install that tool"

194,2019-01-14T10:50:10.170100,Malena,There are other ways to set up your virtual environment. Pipenv and Poetry are two others ways.
194,2019-01-14T10:50:15.170300,Malena,People 'round here swear by the latter.
194,2019-01-14T10:51:08.170500,Rodrick,ok
194,2019-01-14T11:06:58.171500,Ashley,"yep. it basically boils down to just a folder that holds stuff for the environment, and altering your `PATH` variable to point there first when it’s activated so your shell uses that stuff"
194,2019-01-14T11:07:41.172100,Rodrick,im in a metting rn so ill be done in 15 min
194,2019-01-14T13:21:19.173900,Rodrick,<@Ashley> how do I change the version of venv
195,2019-01-14T13:29:34.174100,Claudine,the python version?
195,2019-01-14T13:30:59.174800,Claudine,`pythonX.Y -m virtualenv (envname)`
195,2019-01-14T13:31:22.175200,Claudine,ex. `python3.7 -m virtualenv MyProject`
195,2019-01-14T13:32:01.176200,Chester,"(note that this command creates a new virualenv, it's not possible to update an already existing virtualenv)"
195,2019-01-14T13:32:12.176600,Claudine,"well, that's creating one with a specific version, updating an existing env.... aww malinoff beat me to it"
195,2019-01-14T13:40:50.177000,Rodrick,yes thanks
195,2019-01-14T13:45:29.179000,Rodrick,"Problem, when I am in the folder where I want to create the venv I type in ""python2.7 -m virtualenv RaavTestX1"" I get this error ""'python2.7' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."" What am I missing?"

195,2019-01-14T13:49:25.179800,Rodrick,If it matters I have python 3.6
195,2019-01-14T13:52:19.181400,Clemmie,"In order to use a python version for a virtual environment (or anything) you need that version installed opn your system. Do you have python2.7 installed anywhere (the answer should be yes for almost any OS there is,as far as I know)"
195,2019-01-14T13:53:41.183100,Clemmie,"Also, did you try to run the above command while in an activated 3.6 virtual environment? If you did, that won’t work. You need to be exited(deactivated) from a venv and use an installed system python for the command"
195,2019-01-14T14:01:53.184100,Rodrick,yea I was not in any venv and I do not think that 2.7 is installed because 3.6 came with this pc
195,2019-01-14T14:02:09.184400,Clemmie,"Ok, then you will need to install 2.7"
195,2019-01-14T14:02:16.184600,Rodrick,ok
195,2019-01-14T14:02:33.184900,Rodrick,thanks

198,2019-01-14T15:02:15.207400,Shan,i…i dont even know how that happens.
198,2019-01-14T15:02:31.207600,Cathrine,What?
198,2019-01-14T15:03:14.208000,Hiroko,I’d delete the venv and try again
198,2019-01-14T15:03:29.208500,Hiroko,how did you create the virtualenv in the first place?
198,2019-01-14T15:03:44.209000,Shan,thats whild.
198,2019-01-14T15:04:36.209700,Cathrine,Conda create -n xormbi python=3.7
198,2019-01-14T15:06:46.210300,Shan,delete the current virtualenv.  open up a new shell.  attempt to install it again.
198,2019-01-14T15:07:48.211600,Hiroko,"when you create the env, what’s the output of `conda list`?"
198,2019-01-14T15:08:30.212400,Hiroko,also you might have to install pip to conda env
198,2019-01-14T15:08:31.212600,Hiroko,<https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#using-pip-in-an-environment>

198,2019-01-14T15:08:53.213500,Hiroko,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
198,2019-01-14T15:08:58.213700,Shan,is that because `conda` is the package manager?
198,2019-01-14T15:09:01.213900,Shan,not `pip`
198,2019-01-14T15:09:05.214100,Hiroko,"probably, yes"
198,2019-01-14T15:09:24.214500,Shan,thats a good catch.  im not sure i wouldve figured that out in a timely manner.
198,2019-01-14T15:09:35.215000,Cathrine,I have tried that several times 
198,2019-01-14T15:09:48.215400,Nikki,Sorry - I've removed
198,2019-01-14T15:10:50.215900,Hiroko,"thanks, but I’m surprised if it would be the issue in the first place"
198,2019-01-14T15:11:35.216500,Shan,especially considering it looks valid given `which pip`
198,2019-01-14T15:13:51.217100,Bethany,mixing conda and pip + venv is eeasy to mess up
198,2019-01-14T15:14:28.217700,Shan,you got some insights <@Bethany>?
198,2019-01-14T15:14:40.218000,Bethany,sec didnt really look into his specific problem
198,2019-01-14T15:15:48.218300,Bethany,it looks like you're mixing up pip and conda
198,2019-01-14T15:16:14.219100,Bethany,so the equivalent of a `pip freeze` or something would be `conda list --explicit`
198,2019-01-14T15:16:16.219200,Cathrine,None
198,2019-01-14T15:16:25.219800,Bethany,which you would execute within the conda environment
198,2019-01-14T15:16:59.220400,Bethany,or i think `conda env export`
198,2019-01-14T15:17:11.220900,Hiroko,"<@Cathrine> rather than pasting pictures of code/terminal output, why not copy the text and paste here"
198,2019-01-14T15:17:13.221000,Bethany,"of course that will give it in terms that conda understands, not pip"

198,2019-01-14T15:17:50.222500,Shan,:taco: <@Bethany> droppin that `conda` knowledge.
198,2019-01-14T15:18:17.222900,Bethany,rule of thumb is only pip install after all packages you need from conda are installed.
198,2019-01-14T15:18:58.223400,Shan,i _think_ i know why but can you elaborate?
198,2019-01-14T15:19:19.224000,Bethany,It's best to think of `conda` as a replacement for `yum` or `apt` instead of pip i think
198,2019-01-14T15:19:29.224200,Bethany,plus `venv`
198,2019-01-14T15:19:42.224500,Cathrine,Oh ok
198,2019-01-14T15:20:01.225400,Bethany,"As you may have guessed, I've messed this up countless times myself"
198,2019-01-14T15:20:09.225800,Hiroko,:smile:
198,2019-01-14T15:20:29.226500,Hiroko,this does sound like something that its easy to burn yourself
198,2019-01-14T15:20:40.226700,Shan,it does
198,2019-01-14T15:21:05.227700,Cathrine,Pip instead of conda is there another app I can use? That easily supports “pip freeze”
198,2019-01-14T15:21:17.228100,Shan,lets back up a bit.
198,2019-01-14T15:21:25.228700,Shan,why are you wanting to use `conda`?
198,2019-01-14T15:21:27.228800,Bethany,yeah. Why are you using conda in the first place
198,2019-01-14T15:21:56.229400,Cathrine,I thought it was easier 
198,2019-01-14T15:22:17.229900,Bethany,it doesn't look like your using libraries with C-extensions and hte like. I'd just use pip for this
198,2019-01-14T15:22:33.230100,Shan,why did you think it was easier?
198,2019-01-14T15:22:42.230400,Shan,lets help you select the right tools
198,2019-01-14T15:23:17.231200,Cathrine,Yes please
198,2019-01-14T15:23:52.231900,Bethany,"I use conda for scientific computing and data science stuff. It's great for libraries with C dependencies, which is common in those fields. If you don't need it I think it's a bit more difficult to deal with than say pip + venv"
198,2019-01-14T15:24:31.232600,Shan,are you also using conda so that you can specify specific python versions?
198,2019-01-14T15:24:36.232900,Bethany,yeah
198,2019-01-14T15:24:43.233300,Cathrine,Yes
198,2019-01-14T15:24:52.234000,Shan,check out `pyenv` to manage your python versions.
198,2019-01-14T15:25:00.234600,Bethany,it does a lot. I actually wish the community would stop making extra managers and just make conda better
198,2019-01-14T15:25:16.235100,Bethany,most of what they do is already in that tool
198,2019-01-14T15:25:33.235600,Cathrine,Because virtualenv uses python2.7 as default 
198,2019-01-14T15:25:36.235800,Shan,"unsure, ive never felt compelled to use it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
198,2019-01-14T15:25:48.236800,Cathrine,And I’ve tried changing that but no luck too
198,2019-01-14T15:25:56.237200,Hiroko,"incorrect, <@Cathrine> venv uses whatever python version you specify"
198,2019-01-14T15:26:20.238100,Hiroko,sounds like you started the venv incorrectly
198,2019-01-14T15:26:29.238400,Bethany,do people use `pyenv` to manage multiple pythons if you don't have conda?
198,2019-01-14T15:26:39.238600,Shan,i do
198,2019-01-14T15:26:59.239100,Hiroko,I use docker mostly
198,2019-01-14T15:27:01.239300,Hiroko,so no
198,2019-01-14T15:27:10.239900,Hiroko,but I can understand the use case
198,2019-01-14T15:27:15.240100,Bethany,yeah now i prefer to just do docker + miniconda
198,2019-01-14T15:27:36.240500,Bethany,docker makes the environment stuff irrelevant
198,2019-01-14T15:27:53.240800,Shan,i use `pyenv` with `direnv`.
198,2019-01-14T15:28:06.241200,Cathrine,None
198,2019-01-14T15:28:20.241800,Shan,"eh, im resource strapped.  spinning up docker containers outside of what i have to run is rough. :disappointed:"
198,2019-01-14T15:28:38.242200,Shan,what is that image?
198,2019-01-14T15:28:45.242700,Cathrine,Which do I use?
198,2019-01-14T15:28:51.243000,Shan,can you paste text rather than pictures
198,2019-01-14T15:29:00.243300,Cathrine,Oh right 
198,2019-01-14T15:29:01.243400,Cathrine,Sorry
198,2019-01-14T15:29:23.243900,Cathrine,That is the result for using virtualenv 
198,2019-01-14T15:29:37.244600,Cathrine,It always comes out as python2.7
198,2019-01-14T15:29:41.244800,Hiroko,what command do you use to start the virtualenv?
198,2019-01-14T15:29:51.245200,Cathrine,In the bin file
198,2019-01-14T15:29:55.245500,Hiroko,"no, no"
198,2019-01-14T15:30:04.246100,Hiroko,"sorry, what command do you use to _create_ the venv?"
198,2019-01-14T15:30:05.246200,Cathrine,How do I change it?
198,2019-01-14T15:30:07.246400,Clint,Have you installed the newest python 3 version?
198,2019-01-14T15:30:16.246900,Shan,too many questions.
198,2019-01-14T15:31:02.247800,Clint,"I prefer to use pipenv for my environments, and it is very simple to use. Just a suggestion."
198,2019-01-14T15:31:17.248200,Cathrine,Yes
198,2019-01-14T15:31:25.248600,Shan,`yes` what?
198,2019-01-14T15:31:25.248700,Hiroko,<@Cathrine> sounds like python 2.7 is the default when you do `which python`
198,2019-01-14T15:31:38.249300,Hiroko,try same venv creation with `python3 ....`
198,2019-01-14T15:32:29.250400,Hiroko,"note this:

```jason@orm$ ~/projects/heron ⑂develop*  which python
/usr/local/bin/python
jason@orm$ ~/projects/heron ⑂develop*  python -V
Python 2.7.14
jason@orm$ ~/projects/heron ⑂develop*  python3 -V
Python 3.6.5
jason@orm$ ~/projects/heron ⑂develop*  which python3
/usr/local/bin/python3
```"
198,2019-01-14T15:32:38.250700,Hiroko,system python is 2.7.14
198,2019-01-14T15:33:02.251200,Hiroko,specifying `python3` gets the py3 version installed
198,2019-01-14T15:34:47.253200,Shan,"so you could do, `python3 -m venv .venv` and it will create a virtualenv inside of your current directory in a dir called `.venv`"
198,2019-01-14T15:34:49.253500,Cathrine,"<@Hiroko> yes but it still shows me packages from my main system, when I do the “pip freeze” which was my initial question "
198,2019-01-14T15:35:19.254500,Hiroko,"again, that’s probably because you’re creating the venv with python2"
198,2019-01-14T15:35:23.254800,Hiroko,_not_ 3
198,2019-01-14T15:35:33.255500,Cathrine,<@Shan> oh ok
198,2019-01-14T15:35:40.256000,Hiroko,_and_ not specifying the path to the python interpreter you want to use
198,2019-01-14T15:35:42.256100,Shan,"starting from scratch.
```
- remove current virtualenv
- move to the project dir
- `python3 -m venv .venv`
- `source ./.venv/bin/activate`
```"
198,2019-01-14T15:36:07.257200,Cathrine,Ok what should my first line of code look like?
198,2019-01-14T15:38:05.259500,Cathrine,<@Shan> ok
198,2019-01-14T15:38:33.260300,Clint,"If you are trying to create an environment that does not bring in the current systems packages, just avoid using freeze. I would recommend installing pipenv with pip, (newer versions of python3 comes with pip pre installed) run pipenv install in the folder you want to create your new environment, and that will give you an empty pip file and pipfile.lock, which you can then add packages to through pipenv install ""desired package name here"""
198,2019-01-14T15:39:04.261300,Shan,lets get him going with the basics first <@Clint>
198,2019-01-14T15:39:04.261400,Clint,very clean and simple
198,2019-01-14T15:39:22.261800,Shan,"also, `pipenv` isnt stable.  they are continually releasing breaking changes."
198,2019-01-14T15:39:28.262000,Shan,its a _neat toy_
198,2019-01-14T15:39:51.262300,Clint,I have not had any real issues with it
198,2019-01-14T15:41:29.263800,Clint,"but fair point, I just consider it the easiest way to introduce some one to a virtual environment as it does not need much set up. but you are correct that going through the basics first is probably the better plan"
198,2019-01-14T15:42:47.264600,Cathrine,"Thanks guys, very helpful"
198,2019-01-14T15:42:59.265100,Cathrine,I’ll try these steps and give updates 
199,2019-01-14T14:56:41.201800,Cathrine,"Hello guys I’m running Linux and I’m trying to create a virtual environment to start a new Django project so I created a new virtualenv with conda but whenever I try to pip freeze inside my new virtual env it keeps showing me packages from my main system.

201,2019-01-14T16:48:22.267200,Nenita,"that what i did, but i figured out it helps if you use the correct list lol"

211,2019-01-15T06:41:48.314800,Chad,I am not getting any place to find how to update the graphs while pulling live data from the sqlite database?
212,2019-01-15T08:07:46.315400,Fidelia,"hi all,"
212,2019-01-15T08:08:04.315900,Fidelia,"just a generic question, do we need to collect cookies and what are they used for?"
212,2019-01-15T08:14:50.319200,Ashley,"<@Fidelia> that’s a big question, and really depends on the context. Normally, no, you don’t want to be collecting cookies. The browser only sends the cookies to the server that share the same domain and sub-domain as the server they’d be sent to, and the JS on the site only has access to the cookies according to the same restriction. So usually, you only have access to the cookies you would already know about, so there’d be no point in collecting them"
212,2019-01-15T08:15:20.319600,Ashley,things get more complicated with embedded content though
212,2019-01-15T08:15:42.320000,Fidelia,oh ok what is the use of embeded content?
212,2019-01-15T08:17:29.320700,Ashley,"So I’m sure you’ve seen the “like” button for facebook on sites that aren’t facebook, right?"
212,2019-01-15T08:19:07.322400,Fidelia,yes <@Ashley>
212,2019-01-15T08:19:43.323000,Ashley,"well, those like buttons are actually embedded content and is inside an iframe pointing to facebook. When you see that like button, it means you’re connecting to FB, and they give you a cookie so they can find out every time you visit a site that has one of their like buttons on it"
212,2019-01-15T08:20:09.323500,Ashley,the FB servers know which like button you are seeing and what page it was embedded to
212,2019-01-15T08:20:45.324500,Ashley,"so even if you aren’t logged into FB, or don’t even have a FB account, they can still give you a cookie, and start tracking what pages you go to"
212,2019-01-15T08:20:59.324800,Ashley,they aren’t really collecting the cookie itself
212,2019-01-15T08:21:16.325300,Ashley,but they are using the cookie they gave you to track where you went on the internet
212,2019-01-15T08:21:34.326000,Ashley,"the same is true for other like buttons, e.g. google plus, pinterest, etc"
212,2019-01-15T08:21:47.326200,Fidelia,oh so that can be routed to what type of similar ads they can display on to your wall?
212,2019-01-15T08:22:11.326600,Fidelia,what other use of this way of embedded content ?
212,2019-01-15T08:24:59.326800,Fidelia,?
212,2019-01-15T08:26:02.328100,Ashley,"the only other use would be encouraging user engagement with the platform, and enabling social media addiction by constantly having its presence everywhere"
212,2019-01-15T08:26:45.329300,Fidelia,"oh, so you will have retention rate of existing users"
212,2019-01-15T08:26:50.329400,Ashley,they mostly just want data on people that they can run analyses on and sell to others
212,2019-01-15T08:27:00.329700,Ashley,yes
212,2019-01-15T08:27:00.329800,Fidelia,oh
212,2019-01-15T08:27:23.330300,Fidelia,but that is ok to collect that large amount of data?
212,2019-01-15T08:27:37.330500,Ashley,depends on who you ask haha
212,2019-01-15T08:27:58.330900,Ashley,most tech-literate people condemn it
212,2019-01-15T08:28:04.331100,Ashley,they are not ok with it
212,2019-01-15T08:28:18.331800,Ashley,and many non-tech-literate people also don’t like being watched everywhere they go
212,2019-01-15T08:28:28.332200,Hiroko,"if you do try to do it, you will get a bad reputation"
212,2019-01-15T08:28:44.332900,Ashley,but that’s how big companies like google and FB make a lot of their money
212,2019-01-15T08:28:48.333100,Hiroko,"busineses would want to work with you, sure.  but your personal relationships would suffer"
212,2019-01-15T08:29:02.333600,Ashley,^
212,2019-01-15T08:29:05.333800,Hiroko,I know several people who have lost close friendships after working similar projects at FB/Amazon
212,2019-01-15T08:29:16.334300,Ashley,same
212,2019-01-15T08:29:36.335000,Hiroko,"it was worth it for them professionally, but wouldn’t want to hang out with them in any context more than limited acquantianceship"
212,2019-01-15T08:29:41.335300,Ashley,this is actually a _very_ hot topic at the moment
212,2019-01-15T08:29:44.335500,Hiroko,lost a great deal of respect for them
212,2019-01-15T08:29:59.335700,Ashley,yeah
212,2019-01-15T08:30:10.336100,Ashley,I also know some who got dragged into it unexpectedly
212,2019-01-15T08:30:33.336500,Ashley,"they worked in different areas, and then got reassigned to those things"
212,2019-01-15T08:30:49.336900,Ashley,"they tried to get out quickly though, which was good"
212,2019-01-15T08:31:58.338100,Ashley,"for what it’s worth, there _are_ ethical ways of doing data analysis on large groups of people. They’re just much more difficult, take longer, and aren’t as profitable"
212,2019-01-15T08:32:00.338200,Fidelia,oh sorry to hear that of losing close relationships.
212,2019-01-15T08:32:29.338600,Fidelia,yeah i guess the ethics play a major part of it
212,2019-01-15T08:32:43.338900,Hiroko,ethics also depend on prioritization
212,2019-01-15T08:32:52.339200,Hiroko,"if a company prioritizes them, thats one thing"
212,2019-01-15T08:33:01.339500,Hiroko,"but for the most part, they’re inconvenient"
212,2019-01-15T08:34:23.340400,Fidelia,accepted as they want to balance and make more profits as their primary aim is to sustain and make their VCs happy.
212,2019-01-15T08:34:29.340700,Fidelia,hope that was correct :slightly_smiling_face:
213,2019-01-15T09:02:19.342000,Bethany,I've heard some interesting ideas in these areas. There are moves to make anonymous data acquisition make sense for analysis but it's immature and slow
213,2019-01-15T09:02:39.342400,Bethany,Maybe that would make it less bad
213,2019-01-15T09:03:45.342700,Ashley,depends on how it’s anonymized
213,2019-01-15T09:04:51.343700,Ashley,"there’s a lot you can do to de-anonymize data if it isn’t handled carefully, and a lot of it depends on context, and other sources of data"
213,2019-01-15T09:05:29.344000,Bethany,They're using <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption>
213,2019-01-15T09:05:51.344500,Bethany,So you can do analysis without actually being able to see the data
213,2019-01-15T09:06:02.344800,Ashley,"ah, yeah, that would be helpful"
213,2019-01-15T09:06:17.345300,Bethany,And get statistical results without individual ones
213,2019-01-15T09:07:34.346900,Bethany,I think it helps lessen the privacy invasion thing but maybe you're still treating people as commodity and that's bad enough
213,2019-01-15T09:07:40.347100,Karoline,"This is a big focus at Apple because they see user privacy as a market differentiator, but these days you can't get away from needing user data."
213,2019-01-15T09:09:11.349100,Bethany,"I know it's gonna be huge in regulated spaces, like medical. Gather anonymous data on many people and return a diagnosis or something, and the person doing the computation literally can't see data or even the result"
213,2019-01-15T09:12:54.350100,Fidelia,yes medical is really tough to get into. They have very well and good regulations.

214,2019-01-15T10:08:26.363100,Conchita,"This is code is of ""get it done"" quality, I know it's a bit of a mess hehe. I suspect the 34 columns were created on line 28 with `y = self.address, t.to_string(header=None, index=False)`"
214,2019-01-15T10:10:39.365500,Conchita,"The reason for line 28 is that I wanted to get only the value, and not pandas dtype information"
214,2019-01-15T10:11:11.366000,Clemmie,"I think from lines 31 - 36 replace with:
```
data = [[],[]]
for i,j in y:
   data[0].append(i)
   data[1].append(j)
```"
214,2019-01-15T10:11:56.366700,Clemmie,"That way you end up with data, which is 2 lists, the first with addresses, the second with t.to_string()’s"
214,2019-01-15T10:14:16.367500,Conchita,"I suspect for the same issue (too many columns), I receive this error ```ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)```"
214,2019-01-15T10:18:33.369000,Clemmie,"Looking at the docs that <@Jimmy> pointed out, it looks like your first way should have worked. can you add a print(data) prior to creating the dataframe to see how it is structured?"
214,2019-01-15T10:21:10.369100,Conchita,None
214,2019-01-15T10:22:34.370100,Clemmie,And that is `print(data)`? I would expect it to be in wrapping square brackets
214,2019-01-15T10:22:57.370500,Clemmie,Also for the elements in y to be tuples
214,2019-01-15T10:22:58.370700,Clemmie,hmmm
214,2019-01-15T10:24:07.371900,Conchita,"I used `return data`, where the method call printed it. When using `print(data)` inside the method, I get ```['357R3FeNmySYeHuRfyhFd6nMwzoLDdjfwV', '7377.0']
None
['31odn4bxF2TgM4pD7m4hdSr1vGMsjh9ugV', '6352.0']
None
['3D2oetdNuZUqQHPJmcMDDHYoqkyNVsFk9r', '138661.0']
None
['16ftSEQ4ctQFDtVZiUBusQUjRrGhM3JYwe', '20000.0']

['16rCmCmbuWDhPjWTrpQGaU3EPdZF7MTdUk', '107203.0']
None
['3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64', '108135.0']
None
```"
214,2019-01-15T10:25:13.372500,Jimmy,I think there is a misunderstanding :slightly_smiling_face: can you paste a bigger part of your code
214,2019-01-15T10:25:23.372700,Conchita,Yes hold on :slightly_smiling_face:
214,2019-01-15T10:27:14.373000,Conchita,This is almost the same as I posted above here (just added the print statement)
214,2019-01-15T10:28:45.374300,Clemmie,Well a few things jump out with the print result you just showed. Obviously the `None`s but also if you are appending to a list I would expect the whole thing to be wrapped in `[]`
214,2019-01-15T10:29:30.375100,Clemmie,That `header=None` can you lookup if there is an option for header=False. I think those `None`s might actually _be_ the header
214,2019-01-15T10:30:26.376000,Clemmie,"Also, do those results look like `address/t.to_string()` pairs? (ie. `['3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64', '108135.0']` looks correct?"
214,2019-01-15T10:32:53.377100,Clemmie,"Yup, looking at the pandas to_string def, I think you want `headers=False`
```
header : bool, optional
Write out the column names. If a list of strings is given, it is assumed to be aliases for the column names
```
from <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_string.html>"
214,2019-01-15T10:41:33.377400,Conchita,"Sorry got hit with a powercut here, looking into it now"
214,2019-01-15T10:42:39.377700,Conchita,The results are correct
214,2019-01-15T10:44:30.378100,Conchita,"I did modify so `headers=False`, same result"
214,2019-01-15T10:44:47.378400,Clemmie,You got those `None`s still?
214,2019-01-15T10:47:47.380100,Clemmie,"I’m officially confused. The first element in each y (so in each list of your output) is `self.address` That value is not changed anywhere in the code, just set up in `__init__`, but you are seeing different values in your output."
214,2019-01-15T10:47:47.380200,Conchita,"Yes, still get them"
214,2019-01-15T10:49:35.381100,Conchita,"Well, correct until ""but you are seeing different values in your output."". As an example `self.address` = '357R3FeNmySYeHuRfyhFd6nMwzoLDdjfwV'"
214,2019-01-15T10:50:06.381700,Conchita,So the address value is correctly passed / returned
214,2019-01-15T10:50:33.382400,Conchita,Oh sorry
214,2019-01-15T10:51:10.383500,Clemmie,"Right, but from the code you are showing those 6 lists are all populated between lines 32 and 33. All inside a single instance of Crystal which only has one self.address"
214,2019-01-15T10:51:20.383700,Conchita,"I switch between these two and mixed it up here, that's the reason for your confusion
```#run = Crystal('16ftSEQ4ctQFDtVZiUBusQUjRrGhM3JYwe', 30, date)
#print(run.wealth_distribution())

addresses = [
    '357R3FeNmySYeHuRfyhFd6nMwzoLDdjfwV',

for i in addresses:
    run = Crystal(i, 30, date)
    print(run.wealth_distribution())```"
214,2019-01-15T10:51:31.383900,Conchita,Sorry about that
214,2019-01-15T10:51:51.384200,Mica,"oh damn, my bad! I assumed it was a list of lists :stuck_out_tongue:"
214,2019-01-15T10:51:58.384500,Clemmie,Same here
214,2019-01-15T10:52:32.385100,Clemmie,"<@Conchita> what happens when you run the original code you showed, with just one address?"
214,2019-01-15T10:54:38.385900,Conchita,"When I run the original code I pasted above, with only one address I get ```AssertionError: 2 columns passed, passed data had 34 columns```"
214,2019-01-15T10:55:17.386600,Conchita,"If I add `print(data)` into that code I get ```['16ftSEQ4ctQFDtVZiUBusQUjRrGhM3JYwe', '20000.0']
None
```"
214,2019-01-15T10:56:09.387500,Clemmie,"Ok, so the `None` is what is being returned  and the values seem to be ok."
214,2019-01-15T10:56:33.388100,Clemmie,And the address is 34 chars
214,2019-01-15T10:57:15.389300,Clemmie,"comment out lines 32, 33 and make line 30 `data=[y]` then try it"
214,2019-01-15T10:57:17.389400,Conchita,Correct
214,2019-01-15T10:59:42.392200,Conchita,"Outputs ```[('16ftSEQ4ctQFDtVZiUBusQUjRrGhM3JYwe', '20000.0')]
```"
214,2019-01-15T11:00:12.393400,Conchita,"If I change `return data` to `print(data)` I get ```[('16ftSEQ4ctQFDtVZiUBusQUjRrGhM3JYwe', '20000.0')]
None```"
214,2019-01-15T11:00:18.393600,Clemmie,"What is happening is y is not a list, of tuples, just one tuple. So when you looped on y you ended up with data being a list of two elements, not a list with a nested list of two elements. Your data frame tried to take each element into pandas, and since strings are iterable it broke the string into 34 elements, giving you that error"
214,2019-01-15T11:00:43.394000,Clemmie,You deleted your dataframe lines - still need those

216,2019-01-15T11:05:51.399300,Olevia,"Hello,
Hope you're fine today, i've a little problem.
I was doing some methods for a math project and i was looking for how to check if a list was monotonic, divergent or convergent.
I have found how to check monotonic list but i can't find a way to check for divergent and convergent.
Do you have any idea ?"
217,2019-01-15T11:31:50.402300,Nenita,Is there a shorter way for typing this out?
217,2019-01-15T11:34:21.402700,Jimmy,`itertools` probably :smile:
217,2019-01-15T11:35:00.403000,Jimmy,<https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain.from_iterable>
217,2019-01-15T11:35:13.403200,Jimmy,or just regular `itertools.chain`
218,2019-01-15T13:30:49.405500,Nenita,"Anyone knowledgeable on adding sheets to an excel file using pandas? This code ends up overwriting the entire workbook or sheet. (one or the other, I only had 1 sheet in the workbook to begin with). Some examples as shown here: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42370977/how-to-save-a-new-sheet-in-an-existing-excel-file-using-pandas/42371251> look similar to what I have and I am not sure how it is different in the form of telling it to add sheets rather than overwrite them."
218,2019-01-15T13:34:50.406400,Bethany,"<@Olevia> it sounds like you mean divergent and convergent in the context of a mathematical series, is that right?"
218,2019-01-15T13:35:56.407500,Bethany,"As in, a convergent series is one where limit of x -&gt; infinity is well defined"
218,2019-01-15T13:36:30.407900,Olevia,<@Bethany> yes !
218,2019-01-15T13:37:49.409000,Bethany,can you show one example?
218,2019-01-15T13:39:13.409600,Olevia,A divergent series like sum(1/n) and a convergent series like sum(1/n^2)
218,2019-01-15T13:42:24.409700,Marth,"from the link, it looks as though as long as you use a unique sheet_name each time, it'll create different sheets.  Does it not?"
218,2019-01-15T13:54:26.410000,Nenita,"I am not using excelwriter so in the form of my example, no, it just overwrites the entire workbook. I created 3 blank sheets and wrote to a sheet ""qb results"". it removed all 3 sheets and then wrote in qb results."
218,2019-01-15T13:55:19.410200,Nenita,"but from those examples, the line ""to_excel('attributes here')"" there is not much difference so im thinking excelwriter with openpyxl tells it to add or overwrite a sheet"
218,2019-01-15T13:57:31.411300,Sasha,"Normally you wouldn't be able to make convergence determinations from a finite list of numbers, since you need the behavior out to infinity. What finite property are you trying to assess?"
218,2019-01-15T13:58:33.411700,Olevia,That's the problem
218,2019-01-15T13:59:51.413400,Olevia,"If i want to iterate n time on a method to see if it's convergent or divergent, i dont know how to handle this with python"
218,2019-01-15T14:01:07.414700,Sasha,"It's basically impossible. You could have a method which outputs ""1, 1, 1, 1, 1"" for a trillion places, and then suddenly switches to an exponential function."
218,2019-01-15T14:01:14.415000,Sasha,What problem are you really trying to solve?
218,2019-01-15T14:03:02.416500,Olevia,I just want to put a serie as à parameter for a method who can tell me if the serie is divergent or convergent
218,2019-01-15T14:03:29.417000,Sasha,"Do you have the formula for the series, or do you need to treat it as a black box of outputs?"
218,2019-01-15T14:05:10.417600,Olevia,The objective is to put any formula
218,2019-01-15T14:05:38.418400,Olevia,And enter the n time to Check
218,2019-01-15T14:06:37.419200,Marth,So I tested trying the following:
218,2019-01-15T14:06:53.419600,Sasha,"Can you explain how ""n"" matters? Do you want the behavior at infinity, or are you looking for some finite property like ""function is still growing at n""?"

218,2019-01-15T14:09:06.423000,Olevia,Normaly you can test a serie just by trying to find in what n the serie is divergent/convergent
218,2019-01-15T14:09:29.423300,Nenita,so im assuming i have to use excelwriter?
218,2019-01-15T14:09:30.423500,Marth,so it looks like you have to use a writer object to write without overwriting? and then you save at the end
218,2019-01-15T14:09:40.423900,Marth,looks like it
218,2019-01-15T14:10:08.424500,Nenita,"well thanks for the help. you didn't have to go that far, but awesome I now know this. Thanks again."
218,2019-01-15T14:10:17.424900,Sasha,"At any finite n, you can calculate sum(1/n), and it's just a number. Its divergence is only a property at infinity. How would your program use n for this?"

218,2019-01-15T14:16:24.429500,Olevia,Yeah i see what you tried to ask me
218,2019-01-15T14:16:27.429700,Clemmie,<@Olevia> do you have a link to a mathematical formulation that exlpains how what you are trying to do is possible?
218,2019-01-15T14:17:51.430400,Clemmie,Or are you trying to code up an algorithm for analyzing if a series has a limit?
218,2019-01-15T14:20:28.430800,Clemmie,If the latter use SymPy <https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/series/limitseq.html>
218,2019-01-15T14:21:33.431200,Clemmie,"for reference, I found that by googling “python calculate the limit of a series”"
218,2019-01-15T14:23:00.433200,Olevia,"For the moment i need to check if a series is convergente or divergent, then i will check the series has a limit"
218,2019-01-15T14:23:02.433400,Bethany,Yeah what Ed is saying is true. Any finite series has infinitely many patterns that could explain it
218,2019-01-15T14:23:26.433700,Bethany,Is this for homework?
218,2019-01-15T14:23:34.433900,Olevia,Yes

218,2019-01-15T14:27:58.439600,Briana,"I am having a challenge finding information on turning the stdout of a command from subprocess into a dict. Can anyone point me in the direction I need to look please? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Here is the output
```
HOST1
    data1 = 0
    data2 = 10
    data3 = 694d7302424e69627fb6b0dedf9b362c01c6b597

    data4 = 29459019324
    data5 = string.host2.name
```

I am trying to turn the above data into this

`host1_dict = {'data1':'0','data2':'10','data3':'694d7302424e69627fb6b0dedf9b362c01c6b597','data4':'234910','data5':'string.host1.name'}`


`host2_dict = {'data1':'12','data2':'23','data3':'7219a50894aede1c48f4a2f888dd57dda9d89230','data4':'29459019324','data5':'string.host2.name'}`"
218,2019-01-15T14:28:46.440900,Bethany,Though a less precise and possible approach could be to check the difference between consecutive terms. If the difference approaches zero it's a hint that it's converging
218,2019-01-15T14:30:10.441800,Kiera,<@Briana> are you asking about how to capture the stdout from subprocess or how to manipulate the captured string to create the dictionary you're looking for?
218,2019-01-15T14:30:49.442500,Briana,Trying to manipulate the str variable that was created in the stdout captured from the command
218,2019-01-15T14:36:18.444900,Olevia,"That's the first idea i tried, but some serie are annoying like 1/n+10000000"
218,2019-01-15T14:36:53.445700,Bethany,Is this a math or programming class
218,2019-01-15T14:37:03.446100,Olevia,programming
218,2019-01-15T14:37:31.446700,Olevia,I'm very interested about python but i admit that this problem is very strange
218,2019-01-15T14:37:34.446900,Bethany,Do they say to write a program or to do it by hand?
218,2019-01-15T14:38:07.447700,Briana,"ok, how do I handle HOST1 and HOST2 to make them my new dict starter. These are random hostnames `stupid.host.name` and `idiot.has.no.naming.scheme` are the sections I am looking for. Once I split this, I do I key off of these 2 items to make them the dict name once I split."
218,2019-01-15T14:38:15.447800,Olevia,Write a program that can show if the series is divergent or convergent
218,2019-01-15T14:38:20.448000,Olevia,any series**
218,2019-01-15T14:38:33.448400,Bethany,"This is an odd thing to program, unless you're writing a symbolic algebra software"
218,2019-01-15T14:39:24.449500,Bethany,Can yo you paste the question in its entirety?
218,2019-01-15T14:39:58.450800,Olevia,Yes
218,2019-01-15T14:40:51.452800,Briana,the data sections of the output are fairly consistent. the header of the output is the actual hostname of one of the connected machines I am pulling the data from. My final output is going to be converting these and outputting the data to a json that is unique for that host containing the data.
218,2019-01-15T14:40:51.452900,Olevia,But i'm not sure that they want us to write symbolic algebra
218,2019-01-15T14:41:03.453400,Bethany,I doubt it
218,2019-01-15T14:41:23.454200,Bethany,Which is why I want to see the whole question exactly as written
218,2019-01-15T14:41:28.454500,Briana,I am trying to figure out how to split the sections into seperate hosts. On a single run there will be around 1000 of those blocks
218,2019-01-15T14:41:30.454600,Bethany,We may be missing some info
218,2019-01-15T14:41:40.454800,Kiera,"The easiest way might be to have a ""parent"" dictionary that holds the host dictionaries, keyed off the `HOST` line itself.  That way, as you're looping through, when you find a line that begins with a non-space character, just add that line to the ""parent"" dictionary as the key with a value of a blank dictionary; record either the key, so that subsequent data lines can be added as `parent_dict[host_key][data_key] = data_value`, or record the dictionary itself (`host_dict = {}` // `parent_dict[host_key] = host_dict`) so that subsequent data lines can be added directly into the host dictionary: `host_dict[data_key] = data_value`"
218,2019-01-15T14:42:01.455100,Briana,ok makes sense
218,2019-01-15T14:42:24.455700,Olevia,"Program a program in python language to determine if the sequence is convergent, divergent or has no limits."
218,2019-01-15T14:42:37.456100,Kiera,"this way you'll end up with
```
{
     'HOST1': {
        'data1': '0',
        'data2': '10',
        # …
    },
    'HOST2': {
        # …
    },
}
```"
218,2019-01-15T14:42:54.456200,Olevia,And the user must be able to put is own sequence
218,2019-01-15T14:43:22.456800,Bethany,That's it? I'm surprised
218,2019-01-15T14:43:25.457000,Olevia,I've only that
218,2019-01-15T14:43:26.457300,Kiera,"although, if you're only looking for information about a single host, it _might_ be more efficient to look for that hostname first, then just process that one data block."
218,2019-01-15T14:44:06.458200,Olevia,"A bit hard when you know that i've never used python before that, but it's a very good langage"
218,2019-01-15T14:44:18.458700,Kiera,"it depends on whether or not you need to access other hosts later, or otherwise keep accessing or manipulating the overall data set."
218,2019-01-15T14:45:04.459400,Briana,"The data will pull in the output for 1000 hosts. process them into a json, submit the jsons to an api, then quit."
218,2019-01-15T14:45:19.459800,Briana,"no retention will be required, just simply being able to build the array from the dict"
218,2019-01-15T14:45:46.460400,Briana,"I don't use all the datapoint. in the end there are actually about 30 for each host, I am going to be pulling 7"
218,2019-01-15T14:46:32.460500,Bethany,it's odd since those terms only have meaning for infinite sequences
218,2019-01-15T14:46:45.460900,Bethany,and a user can't input an infinite sequence
218,2019-01-15T14:47:02.461300,Briana,I appreciate your assistance <@Kiera>
218,2019-01-15T14:52:01.461600,Olevia,That's why we can set the n time we want to check the sequence
218,2019-01-15T14:52:26.461800,Bethany,how is the sequence input?
218,2019-01-15T14:52:45.462000,Bethany,"like is the input a list like `[1, 2, 3, 4, ...]`"
218,2019-01-15T14:52:57.462200,Bethany,or is it a mathematical function like `x[n] = 1/n`
218,2019-01-15T14:54:49.462400,Bethany,"apparently if you really want to get pendantic, every finite sequence converges <https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/600795/can-a-sequence-be-called-convergent-divergent-if-it-has-finite-number-of-terms>"
218,2019-01-15T15:04:06.462700,Olevia,"I've tried with a list like [1, 2, 3, 4, ...], it's easier, but i think if i want to do a very good function, it should be a mathematical function"
218,2019-01-15T15:05:45.462900,Olevia,"I think i will see if it's possible to use finite sequence, it would be much easier to try to develop"
218,2019-01-15T15:07:40.463100,Bethany,"yes, it's just fundamentally invalid :stuck_out_tongue:"
218,2019-01-15T15:07:56.463300,Bethany,i think that is closer to what they are looking for though
218,2019-01-15T15:08:24.463600,Olevia,Thank you for your help <@Bethany> ! That's very appreciate
218,2019-01-15T15:14:42.464200,Nikki,Anyone know of an API which will take screen grabs of webpages?
219,2019-01-15T14:35:17.444300,Kiera,"this seems fairly straightforward.  First. split the output around newlines, to create a list of lines.  Then loop through each line.  If the line begins with `HOST`, then that tells you which dictionary you're working on.  Otherwise, split the line around `=`; as long as it has 2 fields, strip each field of leading and trailing whitespace and add the resulting key and value into the dictionary you're working on."
219,2019-01-15T14:38:22.448300,Kiera,what do you mean?
220,2019-01-15T15:28:39.464800,Shan,"Define, screen grabs."
220,2019-01-15T15:28:59.465300,Shan,Salenium might be your best bet.
220,2019-01-15T15:33:39.465600,Nikki,"Yea, I thought that - as in screenshot"
220,2019-01-15T15:43:33.466500,Shan,Probs selenium then.  It might be Overkill but I'm not sure of a lighter weight one.

221,2019-01-15T15:58:42.473400,Hiroko,"you could do something like

221,2019-01-15T16:10:45.475500,Hiroko,or have your server update with the response encoding type
221,2019-01-15T16:10:52.475800,Hiroko,but I have a feeling that part is out of your control
221,2019-01-15T16:10:58.476000,Hiroko,check my suggestion above

222,2019-01-15T20:49:27.492900,Hiroko,recursion occurs when a function calls itself many times
222,2019-01-15T20:49:55.493600,Hiroko,I don’t see any case where this method is getting called umpteen times to cause that error
222,2019-01-15T20:50:42.494500,Sherman,"Both functions that are hitting maximum recursion depth are using a built it python library called requests, so at the most basic level, both the failing functions do this:

```import requests
r = requests.get(url)```"
222,2019-01-15T20:50:57.494900,Sherman,So it seems to be an issue with a built in python library
222,2019-01-15T20:51:10.495200,Shan,doubtful.
222,2019-01-15T20:52:17.495700,Sherman,"This is the traceback:

222,2019-01-15T20:52:35.496100,Sherman,That’s a built in python library that’s failing
222,2019-01-15T20:52:50.496300,Sherman,Note that part that says “[Previous line repeated 482 more times]”
222,2019-01-15T20:53:24.496700,Shan,"oh, i understand what a recursion error is."
222,2019-01-15T20:54:00.497900,Sasha,This traceback is for the previous _fetch function that directly used functools. Do you have one for the other code sample?
222,2019-01-15T20:54:10.498300,Shan,have you tried stepping through the program with `pdb`?
222,2019-01-15T20:54:14.498400,Shanna,"Did you actually try this? You mentioned the idea of this, but unclear of the implementation. Want to know if it is the url or the params.

222,2019-01-15T20:55:15.499300,Sherman,So I have yet to be able to walk through it with a debugger
222,2019-01-15T20:55:28.499600,Shan,"oh, you cant replicate the issue on demand?"
222,2019-01-15T20:55:56.500300,Sherman,"No it seems to be sporadic, occurring late a night. I’ve check my traffic and nothing weird is happening with the traffic during that time"
222,2019-01-15T20:56:07.500700,Hiroko,what about the size of the response?
222,2019-01-15T20:56:23.501500,Sherman,"So basically, a post request with the same parameters will sometimes fail and sometimes pass"
222,2019-01-15T20:56:25.501700,Hiroko,"I mean, you’re hitting a service.  does the response from that service change enough?"
222,2019-01-15T20:56:28.501900,Sasha,I worry about thread-safety issues.
222,2019-01-15T20:56:40.502300,Sherman,"Hmm, haven’t check the size yet. And I was thinking it may have to do with multithreading"
222,2019-01-15T20:56:52.502800,Hiroko,are you doing this inside multithreading context manager?

222,2019-01-15T20:57:34.504600,Sherman,Could someone provide some insight?
222,2019-01-15T20:57:51.505200,Hiroko,gotta show the function you’re using that threadpool in
222,2019-01-15T20:58:01.505800,Sherman,One sec
222,2019-01-15T20:58:09.506200,Hiroko,"I mean, you’re just showing things in dribs and drabs, so hard to provide anything meaningful;"
222,2019-01-15T20:58:40.507400,Sherman,"Ya sorry about that, since I have no idea what could be causing it, I’m refraining from just dumping everything lol. But lemme get that function that uses multi threading stay tuned"

225,2019-01-16T03:21:40.541400,Shan,<@Chad> look above this for a response.
225,2019-01-16T03:24:00.542700,Shan,<@Sharolyn> are you sure `msg` contains anything?
225,2019-01-16T03:24:18.543100,Shan,you can use `pdb` as you run through the script to check on that.
225,2019-01-16T03:24:56.543800,Shan,"or, you can just `print type(msg)`."
225,2019-01-16T03:25:38.544500,Sharolyn,<@Shan> above text is from  print(msg) only
225,2019-01-16T03:26:29.545300,Shan,~where are you getting the message from~ What is setting `msg`?
225,2019-01-16T03:29:37.546600,Chad,<@Shan> `match` might be in the library. So is there anything which I can do to solve this?
225,2019-01-16T03:30:45.547000,Sharolyn,None
225,2019-01-16T03:30:55.547600,Sharolyn,<@Shan> ^^
225,2019-01-16T03:36:20.548300,Shan,ah
225,2019-01-16T03:36:41.548500,Shan,`msg` is a dict.
225,2019-01-16T03:37:00.548800,Shan,its expecting ```TypeError: expected string or buffer```

225,2019-01-16T03:39:25.549600,Shan,"change it to `smtpObj.sendmail(sender, receivers, msg.as_string())`"
225,2019-01-16T03:40:15.550000,Shan,<@Chad> what sets `stkname` in `data = nse.get_quote(stkname)`?
225,2019-01-16T03:41:52.551900,Shan,it may be a multithreading issue.  but one thing you could do is wrap that offending code into a `try/except` block.
225,2019-01-16T03:43:04.553000,Shan,<@Sharolyn> hope the change to use `msg.as_string()` solves your problem.
225,2019-01-16T03:43:08.553200,Shan,im out. night all.
225,2019-01-16T03:45:51.554000,Sharolyn,thanks <@Shan>  currently not at desk i will change and revert

229,2019-01-16T06:10:25.558900,Conchita,I need to run Python 3.6 for a project and I'm running 3.7.1 by default. What is the best way to accomplish this?
229,2019-01-16T06:11:07.559500,Conchita,"By best, I mean easiest in this case :slightly_smiling_face:"
229,2019-01-16T06:11:16.559900,Chester,`pyenv`
229,2019-01-16T06:11:34.560300,Conrad,"if you have macOS and brew, I think brew allows you to install different versions of python (and have them coexist)"
229,2019-01-16T06:17:49.560700,Karoline,yeah I'd go with pyenv here.
229,2019-01-16T06:24:41.561500,Mica,agree to pyenv
230,2019-01-16T06:24:34.561300,Mica,^^
231,2019-01-16T06:37:02.562800,Wilhelmina,"Not very familiar with pyenv myself, so I prefer to use virtualenv :slightly_smiling_face:"
231,2019-01-16T06:37:58.563300,Chester,These are two completely different tools
231,2019-01-16T06:38:00.563500,Conchita,"Will try pyenv, thanks!"
231,2019-01-16T06:38:18.563900,Chester,"(oh my god, we have so many JPs)"
231,2019-01-16T06:38:49.564800,Mica,"ye, pyenv is for managing python versions, whereas virtualenv is for isolating python packages for projects and stuff"
231,2019-01-16T06:39:48.564900,Wilhelmina,thanks for pointing that out :smile: looks like username change will have to take place
232,2019-01-16T07:16:28.565900,Jimmy,<@Wilhelmina> virtualenv and pyenv are used together. There are not exclusive
232,2019-01-16T07:16:39.566200,Jimmy,pyenv is used to install other python version
232,2019-01-16T07:16:59.566700,Jimmy,you can then create virtualenv for your project with a different version of python
232,2019-01-16T07:17:17.567100,Jimmy,oups I missed <@Mica> answer :smile:
232,2019-01-16T07:17:39.567400,Mica,"haha no worries, you gave a more detailed response :stuck_out_tongue:"
232,2019-01-16T07:27:13.567500,Jamey,Solved this by merging the models into one and adding boolean flags for different fields as well as a choices field.

234,2019-01-16T12:27:25.572900,Sasha,"Yeah, that's what the error message is about, right?"
234,2019-01-16T12:29:58.574500,Nenita,Here is a sample of what the data looks like.

234,2019-01-16T12:49:38.579600,Sasha,"That's probably just slurping everything into a single column, though. The problem is the trailing comma, which implies an extra column. Do you have any control over how that file is generated?"
234,2019-01-16T12:52:40.580200,Nenita,nope. generated straight from Lowe's website. That's the layout for Lowe's statements.
234,2019-01-16T12:55:26.580700,Nenita,well the separator is somewhat merging the row data.
234,2019-01-16T12:56:14.581200,Nenita,this doesn't iterate through the row rather it just prints the entire row.
234,2019-01-16T12:56:20.581500,Sasha,"You may have to preprocess the data to get it into consistent CSV format, then."
234,2019-01-16T12:56:44.582000,Sasha,"Yeah, `sep=';'` is telling it to ignore the commas and look for (non-existent) semicolons."
234,2019-01-16T12:57:05.582200,Sasha,So everything is one column now.
234,2019-01-16T12:57:40.582400,Nenita,that makes sense
234,2019-01-16T13:00:57.583100,Nenita,maybe i could split it afterwords
234,2019-01-16T13:01:28.583700,Sasha,"It looks like if you explicitly pass in 17 column names with a `names` parameter, instead of header detection, it will give you NaN values when the 17th column doesn't appear, but will not error out."
234,2019-01-16T13:01:59.584100,Nenita,"i was thinking that earlier, but didn't know if it'd be worth the work at the time."
234,2019-01-16T13:33:42.585100,Nenita,houston we have a problem. names is removing some of the beginning data. specifically about 20 rows.
234,2019-01-16T13:36:35.585500,Sasha,"That doesn't make a lot of sense. No errors, just missing data?"
234,2019-01-16T13:36:54.585900,Nenita,"yea, it's odd. let me see if i can post some of the text."
234,2019-01-16T13:43:26.586800,Nenita,"nvm, i was using header instead of name. name definitely did the trick, but out of 3 different types of reports/statements, i think leaving it at a default of 20 should be good."
234,2019-01-16T13:43:33.587000,Nenita,thanks for the help

I'm at work right now, so I may not be able to respond immediately, but in the meantime, maybe try to avoid the dictionary portion until the end?

238,2019-01-16T21:24:00.618300,Shan,"_why_ do you need `{""apple"":""a"",""Banana"":""b"",""apple"":""a1"",""Banana"":""b1""}`"
238,2019-01-16T21:24:16.618700,Shan,why cant you do one of the other suggestions?
238,2019-01-16T21:24:25.618800,Hai,the api is build like that
238,2019-01-16T21:24:26.619000,Hai,yeah
238,2019-01-16T21:24:36.619400,Hai,how would i make them as list?
238,2019-01-16T21:25:08.619600,Hai,"{'apple':['a', 'a1'], 'banana': ['b', 'b1']} i think this works"
238,2019-01-16T21:25:26.620000,Hai,"how would i make {'apple':['a', 'a1'], 'banana': ['b', 'b1']} this happen?"
238,2019-01-16T21:28:31.620200,Shan,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; data = {""a"":""b"",""a1"":""b1""}
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_dict = dict()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for k, v in data.items():
...     if not 'apple' in my_dict:
...             my_dict['apple'] = list()
...     if not 'banana' in my_dict:
...             my_dict['banana'] = list()
...     my_dict['apple'].append(k)
...     my_dict['banana'].append(v)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_dict
{'apple': ['a', 'a1'], 'banana': ['b', 'b1']}```"
238,2019-01-16T21:28:39.620400,Shan,you can make that better but thats the gist.
238,2019-01-16T21:30:39.620800,Hai,yeahh I will try this.
238,2019-01-16T21:31:57.621000,Hai,None
238,2019-01-16T21:32:43.621500,Shan,elaborate what you mean
238,2019-01-16T21:33:02.622200,Shan,well actually
238,2019-01-16T21:33:04.622600,Shan,i get it
238,2019-01-16T21:33:16.623200,Shan,before appending them to `my_dict`.
238,2019-01-16T21:33:47.624200,Hai,the json what am getting has no value it just has a key. so my code doesn't work if it has no value. so instead of that i want to add a string just to  make it work
238,2019-01-16T21:34:00.624500,Shan,"do some conditionals on `k` or `v` and if either is None, assign the appropriate value with whatever string you want"
238,2019-01-16T21:34:06.624800,Shan,"like, `k = 'None'`"
238,2019-01-16T21:34:33.625600,Shan,or. you can simply not deal with that data by ignoring it.
238,2019-01-16T21:34:35.625700,Hai,am getting these keys and values from an excel sheet which is columns and rows
238,2019-01-16T21:44:09.625800,Hai,None
238,2019-01-16T21:46:50.626400,Shan,"iterate through `b` and if the value is null, overwrite the value."
238,2019-01-16T21:48:07.626600,Hai,how??
238,2019-01-16T21:48:31.626900,Shan,leveraging a similar loop like i provided above.
238,2019-01-16T21:50:02.627200,Hai,None
238,2019-01-16T21:53:21.627700,Shan,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = {'my_key': ''}
&gt;&gt;&gt; for k, v in foo.items():
...     if not v:
...             v = ""temp""
...             foo[k] = v
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo
{'my_key': 'temp'}```"
238,2019-01-16T21:55:56.628200,Hai,alright I will try and let you know. Thanks a lot <@Shan>
238,2019-01-16T22:00:40.629700,Maricruz,"I've got this script (django management command) that is wrapped in a `While True:` loop so that it can run indefinitely. I want to move this script up to my server and schedule it as a cronjob. The script very occasionally fails. I was thinking of having the cronjob run every hour or two hours, but only execute if the command is not currently running (i.e. hasn't failed)."
238,2019-01-16T22:00:52.630000,Maricruz,How would I go about doing that? Create a lock file?
238,2019-01-16T22:01:05.630300,Maricruz,Here's the code snippet I'm looking at:
238,2019-01-16T22:01:22.630400,Maricruz,None
238,2019-01-16T22:49:22.631900,Chester,"<@Maricruz> yeah, a lock file is usually the solution"
239,2019-01-16T22:49:30.632200,Chester,"btw, your exception handing code is weird"
239,2019-01-16T22:50:27.633400,Chester,"replace
```
except Exception as e:
    if str(e) != 'KeyboardInterrupt':
```
with
```
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
except Exception as e:
    ...  # rest of your code
```"
239,2019-01-16T22:58:12.634200,Marth,<@Nenita> Will something like this work?
239,2019-01-16T22:58:36.634300,Marth,None
239,2019-01-16T22:59:38.634900,Marth,You'll end up with a dict that looks like this:
239,2019-01-16T23:01:24.636400,Nenita,that would work. I've been working on  many projects for a good few months now and my goal currently with this project is to have as little/short code as possible.
239,2019-01-16T23:04:43.637900,Nenita,but I also experiment to see what i could get away with and if it'd work right
239,2019-01-16T23:21:22.638700,Maricruz,<@Chester> thanks - I'm gonna change that and thanks for the lock file confirmation :taco:

241,2019-01-17T10:09:12.644600,Hiroko,<@Arturo> have both folders in one folder

241,2019-01-17T10:59:46.646400,Nenita,<@Marth> I'm going to try that today and see how the output will work with the rest of my code
242,2019-01-17T11:11:55.647400,Nenita,<@Marth> looks perfect when converted to a df. Thanks.
243,2019-01-17T11:16:58.647600,Landon,Hi all
243,2019-01-17T11:18:25.649100,Landon,"So, I have a backend ready with API's and database, what python framework can I use to develop the frontend only? I have the HTML/CSS ready as well. I tried Django but it seems like you have to do the api and backend as part of a django project"
243,2019-01-17T11:20:39.649500,Mica,what do you mean frontend? Python frameworks are for backend
243,2019-01-17T11:20:59.650000,Mica,a frontend framework would be something like Vue or React
243,2019-01-17T11:23:34.651200,Landon,"Hi Jabob, the web application part of the project( what the user will interact with) yes like Vue, but is there a Python framework similar to Vue?"
243,2019-01-17T11:23:50.651800,Hiroko,"yeah, but would not advise that"
243,2019-01-17T11:24:14.652400,Hiroko,because going from python to js means lots of leaky abstractions and less-than-optimal performance
243,2019-01-17T11:24:44.653100,Landon,"Its not a new project, like mentioned, the backend and API's all is in place, but I want to redo the admin website"
243,2019-01-17T11:24:46.653200,Hiroko,"also, consider if you’re trying to do something that transpiler framework doesn’t support"
243,2019-01-17T11:25:05.653600,Hiroko,you’re pretty much stuck and have to hack around.
243,2019-01-17T11:25:25.654200,Hiroko,"GWT is a similar project for java to webapps, and its… not good"
243,2019-01-17T11:25:58.655100,Mica,would that be something like Flask and Jinja?
243,2019-01-17T11:26:05.655500,Landon,so its either starting the whole project from scratch using say Django or use Vue with the current backend and API's?
243,2019-01-17T11:26:17.655800,Mica,I'm not really sure what a frontend python would look like
243,2019-01-17T11:28:09.656800,Hiroko,check out <https://hackernoon.com/reconciling-djangos-mvc-templates-with-react-components-3aa986cf510a>
243,2019-01-17T11:28:26.657200,Landon,"<@Mica>, its not a Python frontend as such......I just want to use Python in the current HTML/CSS template I have to communicate to an existing REST API, dont know if this make sense"
243,2019-01-17T11:28:36.657500,Hiroko,you can’t sorry
243,2019-01-17T11:28:53.658100,Hiroko,"if you want that in the browser, you need js to talk to your django server"
243,2019-01-17T11:29:07.658500,Hiroko,which is via ajax calls
243,2019-01-17T11:32:00.660300,Landon,"<@Hiroko> thank you. the backend server is mysql with MuleSoft delivering the REST API's. so for instance I thought ill be able to create the login page in html/css and once the user clicks on the login button ill connect to the REST API for the validation etc, but in a Django type of way within my HTML"
243,2019-01-17T11:33:08.661000,Clemmie,If you already have a working api there is no reason to add django into the mix. It would just be a _very_ heavy way of serving html/css/js
243,2019-01-17T11:34:35.661800,Landon,"<@Clemmie>, yeah for sure, but is there a python web framework that can be used to do this?"
243,2019-01-17T11:35:08.662500,Clemmie,No. you need javascript.
243,2019-01-17T11:35:50.663200,Landon,"yeah so either go with Vue or .NET etc...ok all, thank you for your advise"
243,2019-01-17T11:36:03.663500,Clemmie,"nope, not .NET - that is C++"
243,2019-01-17T11:36:14.663800,Clemmie,"(or C#, I forget)"
243,2019-01-17T11:36:20.664000,Landon,C#
243,2019-01-17T11:36:56.664700,Clemmie,"You can do native javascript (ES5/6),  React, Angular, Vue, or Ember basically"
243,2019-01-17T11:37:10.665000,Landon,ok kewl.....now to learn JS
243,2019-01-17T11:38:40.665400,Landon,or do everything from scratch with Django
243,2019-01-17T11:39:52.666200,Clemmie,"Even if you do it all from scratch in django, if you want it to be api based, you will still need javascript"
243,2019-01-17T11:40:10.666600,Hiroko,:point_up:
243,2019-01-17T11:40:39.667200,Hiroko,api consumption in the browser means JS
243,2019-01-17T11:41:11.667500,Landon,"ok, kewl thanks, understood"
244,2019-01-17T14:08:31.669500,Rolando,how could i delete spaces before any letter and after any letter or number ?
244,2019-01-17T14:08:40.669800,Rolando,not in between so i could not use replace
244,2019-01-17T14:11:06.670200,Clemmie,You mean at the beginning and end of a string?
244,2019-01-17T14:11:52.671300,Clemmie,"```
x = &lt;string&gt;
clean = x.strip()
```"
244,2019-01-17T14:12:30.671500,Rolando,nice thanks
244,2019-01-17T14:12:48.671800,Rolando,but it should be strip(' ')
244,2019-01-17T14:12:54.672000,Rolando,right ?
244,2019-01-17T14:17:03.672900,Letty,"by default it’s all whitespace (newlines, etc), if you only want the `"" ""` character, pass that in explicitly."
244,2019-01-17T14:17:15.673300,Claudine,^yup
244,2019-01-17T14:17:21.673500,Claudine,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = ' bar '
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.strip()
'bar'

244,2019-01-17T14:17:22.673700,Cammie,"Can anyone assist me with using an import in a jinja2 template?

Results in

244,2019-01-17T14:17:55.674300,Claudine,add `import os` to the top
244,2019-01-17T14:18:42.675000,Claudine,oh actually... not sure if you can do import inside a Jinja2 template
244,2019-01-17T14:18:46.675400,Cammie,You cannot. Which is what I’ve learned.
244,2019-01-17T14:18:52.675900,Claudine,but you're trying to call a python library there
244,2019-01-17T14:18:58.676200,Cammie,Yup I understand.

244,2019-01-17T14:19:14.677300,Claudine,set the paths as a variable then pass them into the template maybe?
244,2019-01-17T14:19:17.677600,Cammie,Maybe I pass the directory files and pass them in?
244,2019-01-17T14:19:19.677800,Clemmie,"<@Rolando> no, strip is called on the string itself. so `'  string  '.strip() outputs 'string'`"
244,2019-01-17T14:19:20.677900,Cammie,Yea. Same idea.
244,2019-01-17T14:19:30.678300,Cammie,It just seems way more difficult.
244,2019-01-17T14:19:30.678500,Claudine,yea

245,2019-01-17T15:16:40.685400,Sasha,Usually `None` is used for that.
245,2019-01-17T15:18:20.687100,Nenita,<@Sasha> Perfect. <@Carrol> using a somewhat global variable to store another functions returned value from a tkinter widget.

246,2019-01-17T16:19:36.699800,Marc,you have to call the function by its name
246,2019-01-17T16:19:44.700100,Marc,it would be do_something(var)
246,2019-01-17T16:19:50.700600,Marc,"and it would print ""do something"""
246,2019-01-17T16:20:03.701300,Rosalind,you can do eval(“do_something”)

247,2019-01-17T16:16:42.699000,Nenita,is this possible? using a variable to call a function like this?
247,2019-01-17T16:21:24.702900,Nenita,"ik, but Im really bad about working on a project and then just fall down a rabbit hole of trying different things that pop in my head that may not directly relate to what I am working on atm"
248,2019-01-17T17:21:09.704200,Sasha,"You can indeed assign a function to a variable, and call it later:"
248,2019-01-17T17:37:57.706100,Nenita,<@Sasha> Didn't expect anymore responses on that. Awesome! That's cool to know its do-able.
248,2019-01-17T17:41:07.707000,Sasha,"Yeah, Python is very flexible. Functions are basically just special kinds of objects that have a `__call__` attribute, so you can put them in lists, dicts, etc. too."

249,2019-01-17T23:30:39.710400,Mariana,Hi
249,2019-01-17T23:30:46.710700,Mariana,What's up with the weird names?
249,2019-01-17T23:30:54.711000,Mariana,__init__??
249,2019-01-17T23:32:10.711700,Sasha,"They didn't want the special names to overlap with likely names that programmers would use in their code, like ""init""."
249,2019-01-17T23:36:35.713700,Sasha,"Normally it doesn't matter as much, since if you want you can say `sum = 10` in your code, overwriting the built-in function, and nobody cares but you. But if it's a function like `__init__` that Python has to call itself on your class, it's bad to accidentally run something you didn't mean to."
250,2019-01-17T18:47:35.707500,Marla,"That solves the problem of checking if each letter is in the alph. You are getting closer.
One thing that will happen if you use `alphabet` as a _string_ to store things, is that the letters will be out of order when they are added with `alphabet += i` and will never equal exactly `""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz""` unless by perfect chance your input string is in alphabetical order.
If you want your `alphabet` string to equal exactly `""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz""` (which is what saying `if ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"" in alphabet:` does), you will have to sort `alphabet` somehow.
But, you should look into `set` and learn about why it will work great for this problem."

?"
251,2019-01-18T10:29:28.724100,Luise,"Nothing wrong as such, I just want to avoid for loop."
251,2019-01-18T10:31:13.726800,Luise,"Internal implementation of the c_ function may be taking advantage of vectorization, although I am not certain about it, but for loop won't do that.

251,2019-01-18T10:49:58.730000,Clemmie,<@Adolfo> You can use dictionary unpacking and kwargs on __init__ to handle it. it would look like the following
252,2019-01-18T05:32:32.719200,Bethany,It's hard to say without knowing what you're doing. But it seems like the columns of your array are different 'things'. I'd recommend looking into pandas or maybe a dictionary of arrays
252,2019-01-18T05:33:38.719600,Bethany,pandas has `pd.DataFrame.apply` which does what you ask
252,2019-01-18T10:21:43.722600,Adolfo,I had no idea when importing requests that you can use `urlib3` packages right from requests like `requests.packages.urlllib3` without needing to do `import urllib3` :mindblown:

253,2019-01-18T12:55:26.740900,Shaniqua,just updated the file.
253,2019-01-18T12:55:44.741500,Shaniqua,Still not finding the module 'app'
253,2019-01-18T12:57:38.742000,Antionette,try `.functions import print_firstname`
253,2019-01-18T12:57:40.742200,Shaniqua,but relative imports work
253,2019-01-18T12:57:46.742400,Shaniqua,yes that works
253,2019-01-18T12:58:19.744000,Shaniqua,but I am wondering why absolute does not. I would like to understand what the problem is
253,2019-01-18T12:58:22.744200,Antionette,where are you trying to import? if it's in `__init__` it should be relative
253,2019-01-18T12:58:42.744600,Antionette,because it doesn't know of `app`
253,2019-01-18T12:59:21.745000,Shaniqua,from run.py I do this and it works
253,2019-01-18T12:59:59.745700,Shaniqua,so how can I configure in such a way to have app.functions
253,2019-01-18T13:12:19.746200,Caridad,out of curiosity if you pull your run.py file into the root directory do you still get the error
253,2019-01-18T13:20:33.747000,Shaniqua,it works just fine

254,2019-01-18T13:22:11.748400,Caridad,seems like it has to do with how you execute run.py
255,2019-01-18T14:54:00.752900,Felisa,afternoon all.  I have a situation where I have dates in 2 formats that I need to retrieve and then do something with.  Basically I have both `%m-%d-%y` and `%m-%d-%Y`.  I can't seem to get the IFs and TRYs correct.  Can someone assist?
255,2019-01-18T14:54:15.753000,Felisa,None
255,2019-01-18T14:55:59.753700,Felisa,"For further context, here is the error:  ` ""errorMessage"": ""time data '01-05-19' does not match format '%m-%d-%Y'"", `"
255,2019-01-18T15:02:39.754100,Carrol,`%Y` is year with century
255,2019-01-18T15:04:19.754900,Felisa,"I know, I have both date types"
255,2019-01-18T15:05:17.755900,Carrol,"at some point you are trying to create a datetime using the wrong format. If you don’t know the format beforehand, you can wrap it in try/except"

255,2019-01-18T15:05:47.756600,Felisa,I changed it to this and get the same error

255,2019-01-18T15:06:56.757500,Felisa,ok let me try

255,2019-01-18T15:11:27.758600,Felisa,Same error
255,2019-01-18T15:12:47.759800,Carrol,"I think you misunderstood. What you want to do is wrap the call to strptime in a try block, like this:

```
    try:
        delete_date = time.strptime(delete_date, '%m-%d-%y')
    except ValueError:
        delete_date = time.strptime(delete_date, '%m-%d-%Y')
```"
255,2019-01-18T15:13:34.760300,Carrol,that assumes that you’ll only ever encounter the two formats
255,2019-01-18T15:16:12.760600,Carrol,I also think you mean to use `date` instead of `time`
255,2019-01-18T15:19:13.760800,Felisa,WORKED!
255,2019-01-18T15:19:39.761200,Felisa,I didnt change the time to date.  Is that important?
255,2019-01-18T15:20:27.761300,Felisa,Final snippet

264,2019-01-19T17:02:47.797800,Brandie,"<@Sasha> Yeah, that is kind of an contradiction in itself. The goal is to unify the launch of the python scripts and make it controllable at one place by configuring the launcher.

With launcher and python.exe in the path it can happen different versions of python are run for

$ python script.py

and

script.py

As a solution I see either getting rid of the launcher or python.exe in the PATH."
264,2019-01-19T17:03:30.798200,Jonas,Don’t newer python releases fix this by having a shim launcher?
264,2019-01-19T17:03:52.798500,Jonas,I remember reading about this being introduced

264,2019-01-19T17:13:41.799700,Jonas,I’d just fix the scripts
264,2019-01-19T17:13:56.800100,Jonas,"seems the more correct way, rather than removing python from the PATH"
264,2019-01-19T17:14:41.801000,Brandie,<@Jonas> fix in what way?

264,2019-01-19T17:22:38.803100,Jonas,try looking at the response text to see if it’s giving you an explicit error
264,2019-01-19T17:24:04.803900,Jackie,"requests is a part of the urllib, isn't it?
I have cencored the token and client ID before I pasted those in"
264,2019-01-19T17:28:15.805000,Jonas,"requests is a third party package, it’s a library for making http requests. It’s a lot easier to use than `urllib`"

265,2019-01-19T18:21:54.807900,Candi,I am not able to understand the issue as numpy is installed when I do pip list it says  numpy 1.16.0 is installed
265,2019-01-19T18:22:15.808400,Jonas,"Ok, then 1.16.0 is installed"

265,2019-01-19T18:22:33.809100,Jonas,"you can still use Numpy, perhaps they removed `__version__` in version 1.16"
265,2019-01-19T18:22:38.809400,Jonas,I know there are other changes they made
265,2019-01-19T18:22:58.809900,Jonas,"You know 1.16 is installed, there is no need to use `__version__`"

265,2019-01-19T18:32:14.815300,Jonas,so you have a python file called `numpy`
265,2019-01-19T18:32:16.815500,Jonas,rename this
265,2019-01-19T18:32:27.815900,Jonas,"the reason behind the error may be a bit too deep, but I can explain it if you wish"
265,2019-01-19T18:32:36.816100,Jonas,rename `numpy` to anything else
265,2019-01-19T18:32:54.816600,Candi,so the python scripts name is numpy.py

and i execute execute_remote_command(""mkdir -p {}"".format(namespace), False)"
265,2019-01-19T18:33:21.817100,Lanelle,now if i introduce a list

265,2019-01-19T18:33:33.817900,Lanelle,how can i rewrite the execute_remote_command
265,2019-01-19T18:33:36.818000,Jonas,"yes, rename it to anything other than `numpy` <@Candi>"
265,2019-01-19T18:35:09.818800,Candi,<@Jonas> and <@Marita> it worked thank you somuch
265,2019-01-19T18:35:47.819400,Candi,<@Jonas> can you explain the reason
265,2019-01-19T18:36:27.819700,Jonas,When you run `import numpy` Python does a few things
265,2019-01-19T18:36:42.820100,Jonas,it looks for a *thing* called `numpy` and imports it
265,2019-01-19T18:37:01.820700,Jonas,the way it searches for these things is by looking first for a file in the current directory
265,2019-01-19T18:37:06.820900,Jonas,then for things you have installed
265,2019-01-19T18:37:16.821200,Jonas,(this isn’t totally correct but it’s close enough)
265,2019-01-19T18:37:23.821500,Jonas,so when you had a file called numpy
265,2019-01-19T18:37:26.821700,Jonas,and you did `import numpy`
265,2019-01-19T18:37:37.822100,Jonas,"it imported *your file*, not numpy that you installed"
265,2019-01-19T18:38:16.822500,Jonas,because things you install are just a bunch of python scripts in a specific place
265,2019-01-19T18:38:40.823100,Jonas,imagine `pip install numpy` installed a file called `numpy.py` in a specific folder on your machine
265,2019-01-19T18:38:54.823500,Jonas,when you ran `import numpy` how does python know which `numpy.py` to load?
265,2019-01-19T18:59:46.826100,Jackie,"yes, there are more objects with begin with the same variables, starting with id:"
265,2019-01-19T19:00:47.826200,Sasha,Then you just need:
266,2019-01-19T18:51:35.825000,Jackie,"How do I form a loop to print all ids' from a json dump when the root object's name is not specified, like so:
```[{""id"":258205385,""title"":""inbox"",""owner_type"":""user"",""owner_id"":24392120.....```"
266,2019-01-19T18:58:52.825600,Sasha,"It's not completely clear what kind of data you have. Is it a list of dicts, each of which has an ""id"" field?"
266,2019-01-19T19:02:44.827100,Jackie,"Jesus christ, it's that simple. How was I not able to find it anywhere online"
266,2019-01-19T19:02:47.827300,Jackie,thanks!
267,2019-01-19T21:26:44.827600,Hai,None
267,2019-01-19T21:28:48.828300,Hai,how should i use '==' in pandas?
267,2019-01-19T21:32:15.829100,Hai,it is the error what it is showing
267,2019-01-19T21:35:18.830200,Sasha,"Oh, I think I see. You need indents for your `if` blocks. I'm surprised you don't get an interpreter error."
267,2019-01-19T21:36:10.830800,Hai,<@Sasha> in which line should i give indents?
267,2019-01-19T21:36:44.831300,Sasha,Lines 8 and 10 in the above example. Anything you want to only execute if the `if` is true.
267,2019-01-19T21:37:11.831600,Hai,yeahh got it i will try and let you know
267,2019-01-19T21:37:41.832000,Hai,<@Sasha> still shows the same error
267,2019-01-19T21:39:21.833200,Sasha,Can you post the traceback to identify the line throwing the error?
267,2019-01-19T21:39:58.833700,Sasha,"Note that this function overwrites the `file` global, so if you use it elsewhere, it may be getting confused."
267,2019-01-19T21:43:09.836000,Hai,well actually my script is containrized so my script reads a json file. I want to use this container in different environments each envionrment has its own file  so while running the container i need to give a file name so it should pickup the file name and run that file
267,2019-01-19T21:44:19.836800,Hai,"for  that purpose, i need to write a if elif for environment variables"
267,2019-01-19T21:45:51.837300,Sasha,"That's fine. The error is likely coming from elsewhere, once you have a Dataframe."
267,2019-01-19T21:46:35.837500,Hai,ohh okay
267,2019-01-19T21:47:06.837600,Hai,None
267,2019-01-19T21:47:16.838100,Hai,<@Sasha> is that possible?
267,2019-01-19T21:48:13.838800,Sasha,"You asked this before, and it's not possible as described. What would `myexpecteddata['apple']` be equal to?"
267,2019-01-19T21:48:54.839000,Hai,okay
267,2019-01-19T21:49:16.839400,Hai,actually those keys and values are column name and rows
267,2019-01-19T21:50:11.840400,Hai,"but api only accepts which has has the key should be {""type"":""column name"":""value"":""row name""}"
267,2019-01-19T21:51:56.841600,Sasha,"It sounds like the API might be expecting something which is ""JSON-ish"", but not strictly standards-compliant JSON. In which case you might need to construct things a little more manually by appending JSON pieces together or something."
267,2019-01-19T21:52:57.842400,Hai,yes you are right. I got an idea I will try and let you know
268,2019-01-19T21:31:54.828700,Sasha,Your question isn't very clear. What is `a` in your example?
268,2019-01-19T21:33:03.829300,Hai,<@Sasha> <https://code.i-harness.com/en/q/233625f>

I am trying to create a sublist which uses a while loop to return a sublist of the input list. The sublist should contain the same values of the original list up until it reaches the number 5 (it should not contain the number 5).

270,2019-01-20T00:47:32.845000,Sasha,"That code looks good, and it works for me when I run it (after adding appropriate indents). Are there any differences between what you've posted and what you're testing?"
270,2019-01-20T00:49:38.845400,Sasha,(I would expect that error if the input did not contain 5 anywhere.)

271,2019-01-20T11:11:49.863900,Marita,The syntax for that. I’m assuming that where the asterisk is is where most of the elements are going?
271,2019-01-20T11:14:04.864700,Jonas,"seems clean to me. `x, *y, z` means x is the first element, z is the last and everything in-between goes into y"
271,2019-01-20T11:15:37.865500,Marita,Yeah. Just not a fan of the syntax. Personal preference. :)
272,2019-01-20T11:21:27.866200,Lessie,unpacking syntax is only beautiful in the eyes of the dev who wrote it xD anyone else would have an issue with it.
272,2019-01-20T11:23:03.866700,Hiroko,What alternative would you suggest?
272,2019-01-20T11:35:51.868000,Marita,"Slices. [0], [-1], [1:-2]"
272,2019-01-20T11:38:52.868500,Bethany,"Once you see the newer tuple unpacking, it's significantly cleaner imo"
272,2019-01-20T11:40:38.869100,Jonas,"so it would be `x[0], y[-1], z[1:-2] = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)`?"
272,2019-01-20T11:40:44.869300,Jonas,that seems horrific to me
273,2019-01-20T12:01:49.871700,Marita,"I’d store the set into a variable and use slices.
arr = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
x, y, z = arr[0], arr[1:-2], arr[-1]"
273,2019-01-20T12:07:13.872500,Hiroko,"That, to me, is worse readability than the existing python implementation "
273,2019-01-20T12:13:12.874400,Marita,My personal preference. I’d rather have code that I know what it does at first glance instead of having to look up what the asterisk does in a tuple unpacking.
273,2019-01-20T12:17:16.877200,Hiroko,"But tuple unpacking and the behavior of an asterisk is default in python and would have questions about your approach when reviewing any PR that includes this.

273,2019-01-20T12:19:39.880800,Chester,"It's like iterating over indices (using `for idx in range(len(iterable))` instead of just iterating over elements (or using `enumerate`).
For a yesterday C(++) student `for idx, elem in enumerate(iterable)` may look worse, but this is how python works"
273,2019-01-20T12:20:07.881200,Chester,This is what any python programmer expects to see
273,2019-01-20T12:20:48.881700,Chester,"And yes, if you don't use `enumerate` much in your code, you'll need to look up what it does"
273,2019-01-20T12:25:53.882100,Roxanne,Can anybody help me with this question ? <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/211781/166600>
273,2019-01-20T12:27:25.882600,Jonas,none of that is particularly pythonic :confused:
273,2019-01-20T12:27:59.882800,Jonas,the reason the `process_matches` is slow is the mongodb insert I expect
273,2019-01-20T12:29:22.883000,Jonas,and it’s full of mixed concerns
273,2019-01-20T12:35:05.883400,Roxanne,how should I tackle this instead ?
273,2019-01-20T12:51:55.891500,Ashley,"<@Roxanne> IMO for python and other languages in general, your biggest enemy will likely be your ability to maintain, rewrite, and extend upon large amounts of code. If you have a giant function, you should break it down anyway, regardless of performance. Whenever you have a slice of code that you can sum up with a simple English phrase, you should break that out into a function where that phrase is the name of the method. That helps compartmentalize your logic (making it easier to think about and debug), makes your code more testable/extensible/maintainable, makes your code document itself, and a whole slew of other benefits.

IIRC even NASA has a rule that a function has to be short enough to fit on one screen without scrolling (NASA also uses Python, which is awesome!).

Do you lose performance when doing this? In Python, technically, yes, but it's negligible (compiled languages can often optimize so this doesn't impact performance, anyway)."
273,2019-01-20T12:56:22.894200,Roxanne,"my trade off was basically having to :
1. Keep in self a big list of dictionaries (up to 20 mbs)
2. Do 3 `for` iteartions in separated methods instead of 1  (process_telemetry, process_match_scores, process_players_scores)

But actually makes sense if I end up, for instance, having better control of test or using async requests"
274,2019-01-20T12:34:42.883200,Roxanne,what do you mean with mixed concerns ?
275,2019-01-20T13:56:11.897600,Mercy,Hi guys by using flask app in my dB I’ve got a student data such as attendance and marks in front end if a user types his number the result will be display like you’re eligible for scholarship how to write using flask
275,2019-01-20T14:04:19.898000,Hiroko,"what is your question, <@Mercy>?"
275,2019-01-20T14:05:24.899400,Mercy,How to write that query and display the output as you’re eligible for sch or not eligible 
275,2019-01-20T14:06:43.899900,Hiroko,have you gone through the Flask tutorial or the sqlalchemy tutorial?

275,2019-01-20T14:07:09.900800,Hiroko,sounds like you have a two part problem: db query and result display in the browser
275,2019-01-20T14:09:14.901600,Hiroko,"as far as the first, it would depend on what you have for your db schema in sqlalchmey, assuming you’re using that for your flask app"
275,2019-01-20T14:09:41.902500,Hiroko,"the second would depend on whether you’re using flask to render a template, or sending it to the browser in an API response to be rendered with javascript"

1) TCP Server that should send KeepAlive packets to the 1 client
2) I must be able to send also a packet of special format to this TCP client, and receive a message and return this message to the endpoint in JSON
Is there a best practice for such app?

Basically it’s flask app that can controll TCP server


How can I receive the socket data outside the thread ?"
282,2019-01-21T09:42:38.974600,Kylee,None
282,2019-01-21T09:46:38.975800,Jonas,That sounds like madness. So your sending a specific TCP packet and you are receiving a stream of JSON?
282,2019-01-21T09:47:28.976400,Jonas,"This can get nasty with threads, I'd recommend looking into asyncio"
282,2019-01-21T09:53:15.978500,Kylee,"<@Jonas> No  it’s not a madness
I want to have a simple flask app over TCP server
from flask app I want to be able to
1) start / stop listening
2) Send specific packet and receiver response (and this packet should bet encoded from json to packet for request and from packet to json for flask handler response   )"
282,2019-01-21T09:54:25.979900,Hiroko,seems like what you want is a la kubernetes
282,2019-01-21T09:54:31.980200,Hiroko,with the liveness checks
282,2019-01-21T09:54:35.980400,Kylee,"Example
packet/send -&gt; receives Json {“data”:1234 } -&gt; encode it into packet -&gt; send via socket -&gt; receives response -&gt; decode to Json -&gt; return an answer"
282,2019-01-21T09:55:57.981000,Hiroko,"anyway, why do you want a keep-alive?  what service are you running on that requires this?"
282,2019-01-21T09:56:32.981900,Jonas,You most certainly want asyncio for this <@Kylee> 
282,2019-01-21T09:56:55.982800,Jonas,You want to have a single socket connection shared between multiple web requests 
282,2019-01-21T09:57:07.983000,Kylee,Exact
282,2019-01-21T09:57:20.983500,Jonas,And you cannot have more than 1 open connection?
282,2019-01-21T09:57:32.983700,Kylee,no
282,2019-01-21T09:57:34.983900,Kylee,only 1
282,2019-01-21T09:57:50.984300,Jonas,"Ok, and what about concurrent requests?"
282,2019-01-21T09:58:16.984900,Kylee,no concurrent requests - client it’s the single threaded app
282,2019-01-21T09:58:27.985200,Kylee,but with damned keep alive)
282,2019-01-21T10:01:53.987100,Jonas,"Ok, so I would use aiohttp to define my endpoints. When the app starts you'd open the connection and store it in the application configuration "
282,2019-01-21T10:02:17.987900,Jonas,"Then you'd need some methods to handle locking, as you need to ensure only one request is using the socket at once "
282,2019-01-21T10:02:42.988700,Jonas,"Asyncio will take care of the keep alive, and you don't need threads."
282,2019-01-21T10:03:34.990000,Jonas,"In your method you'd acquire a asynchronous lock, send the data, wait for s response and then release the lock, and return the data. Your views will wait on this method and do something with the response "
282,2019-01-21T10:03:52.990700,Jonas,Out of interest what exactly are you doing? Are you interfacing with some industrial equipment?
282,2019-01-21T10:23:58.991400,Kylee,"Yep , it’s an industrial equipment."
282,2019-01-21T10:24:16.991900,Kylee,And we are writing simulation server for it - for testing purposes
283,2019-01-21T10:29:09.995300,Carmelia,"Hey all, I am trying to use `zeromq` in python. This is what I have:
```
import zmq

context = zmq.Context()

socket = context.socket(zmq.REQ)
socket.connect(""tcp://*:6555"")
print(socket.getsockopt_string(zmq.LAST_ENDPOINT))
```
This errors with the following:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""/tmp/listener.py"", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    socket.connect(""tcp://*:6555"")
  File ""zmq/backend/cython/socket.pyx"", line 580, in zmq.backend.cython.socket.Socket.connect
  File ""zmq/backend/cython/checkrc.pxd"", line 25, in zmq.backend.cython.checkrc._check_rc
zmq.error.ZMQError: Invalid argument
```
When I replace `*` by `localhost`, it works fine. However, zeromq API's for other languages such as C/C++ or Java allow `*` to chose all hostnames (equivalent to ""0.0.0.0""? )."
283,2019-01-21T10:35:47.996300,Malena,"I think request sockets need to have the hostname specified. The zeromq client example has it:
<http://zguide.zeromq.org/cpp:hwclient>"
283,2019-01-21T10:36:45.997000,Malena,IIRC it's also something to do with the difference between `connect` and `bind`.
283,2019-01-21T10:38:20.997700,Malena,"Actually yeah, that makes sense. You'e making a request socket, so it ought to be making a connection to a single reply host."
283,2019-01-21T10:39:00.998200,Malena,"You bind the `zmq.REP` socket, and connect the `zmq.REQ` socket."
283,2019-01-21T10:39:11.998400,Malena,With `bind` you can use `*`.
283,2019-01-21T10:41:33.998500,Lawanna,"Has anyone here done some heavy production level work with schedulers? E.g do something at a specific time, interval, at this timezone
This scheduler can have over 100 active tasks a day, and the schedules can change dynamically (Stored in DB)
When individual tasks are triggered by the scheduer, based on some conditions some other tasks are also scheduled ahead of time.

Things I've tried - celery and huey"
283,2019-01-21T10:43:14.000600,Clemmie,I’ve used and have been happy with celery for a similar use case. I’m pretty sure it would be pretty much everyone’s first suggestion. Is there something about it you are unhappy with?
283,2019-01-21T10:46:56.002800,Carmelia,"Fantastic spot. This is exactly it, I was using `connect` instead of `bind`! Thanks a lot :slightly_smiling_face:"
283,2019-01-21T10:52:57.003400,Hiroko,"celery would be my default fo this, with rabbit as a broker and redis as a backend"
283,2019-01-21T10:53:57.003700,Hiroko,what do you feel celery is lacking for you with this requirement?
283,2019-01-21T10:54:23.004300,Hiroko,"FWIW, at work we use celery extensively with indexing content, with celerybeat"
283,2019-01-21T11:07:06.014300,Clemmie,"Lastly, what is your celery stack? is it celery/rabbitmq/redis like <@Hiroko> suggested, or something different?"
283,2019-01-21T11:07:27.014500,Lawanna,"Yes, that's right. Hence why I went down the route of Huey. I wanted to use celery, because i've used it in the past for other projects. But this problem was worse before.


I believe I am on the latest and greatest.
```
celery==4.2.1
django-celery-beat==1.4.0
Django==2.1.4
```"
283,2019-01-21T11:08:48.016300,Hiroko,"can you determine whether the missing tasks were dispatched and not run, or not dispatched at all?"
283,2019-01-21T11:09:07.016600,Clemmie,Just found this - might be helpful <https://www.vinta.com.br/blog/2017/how-make-sure-celery-beat-tasks-are-working/>
283,2019-01-21T11:09:51.017400,Clemmie,"nevermind, just read it - not so helpful"
283,2019-01-21T11:11:29.018400,Lawanna,"Yes, I have datadog logging a bunch of stuff. I can show you some interesting graphs.

No tasks were dispatched between 4am and 7am UTC"
283,2019-01-21T11:12:05.019700,Arturo,"How would I get an item from a list, if I check a specific string is in it, so for example;

```"

283,2019-01-21T11:14:07.020500,Hiroko,you can use that to find the index of the item and then use said index to retrieve it
283,2019-01-21T11:14:32.020900,Hiroko,<@Lawanna> :thumbsup: on having good monitoring in place
283,2019-01-21T11:14:56.021600,Lawanna,"haha, yes its basically like - have you turned it on? :joy:"
283,2019-01-21T11:14:58.021800,Hiroko,"sorry, I don’t have any ideas."
283,2019-01-21T11:14:59.021900,Arturo,perfect! I should have remembered that one :see_no_evil: <@Hiroko> :taco:
283,2019-01-21T11:15:57.022400,Hiroko,was your db under high load at that time?
283,2019-01-21T11:16:38.023100,Hiroko,"perhaps if it was under high load with elevated query times, perhaps the scheduler wasn’t able to fire off at the appropriate time due to a query timeout?"
283,2019-01-21T11:16:46.023300,Hiroko,I’m just spitballing here
283,2019-01-21T11:17:35.023600,Hiroko,also are you logging db queries?
283,2019-01-21T11:17:49.023800,Lawanna,"Nope, latency and and requests, seem pretty normal"
283,2019-01-21T11:18:02.024300,Hiroko,agreed
283,2019-01-21T11:19:12.024900,Lawanna,I am logging queries yes
283,2019-01-21T11:19:22.025200,Hiroko,"since the scheduler is db backed, I’m curious whether it actually executed the query"
283,2019-01-21T11:20:03.026000,Hiroko,"if so, it narrows down whether the failure happened before or after the db was checked"
283,2019-01-21T11:20:42.026800,Lawanna,"Then we would see a dip during that time no? The scheduler should have checked atleast a couple of times within that 2 hour period, because about 3 tasks were missed within that period"
283,2019-01-21T11:21:51.026900,Arturo,"ah actually there was a slight problem, it was to do with 'lte' not being the complete string, do you think I should use regex to get it?"
283,2019-01-21T11:22:37.027300,Hiroko,correct
283,2019-01-21T11:23:36.028000,Hiroko,which graph is the db monitor?

283,2019-01-21T11:24:14.028900,Lawanna,"The first one is total requests, and 3rd is latency. Both are actually for postgres, the db"

283,2019-01-21T11:25:01.029600,Hiroko,gotcha.  but it doesn’t show which query is being executed
283,2019-01-21T11:25:32.030000,Hiroko,just that something happened
283,2019-01-21T11:26:12.030700,Lawanna,"Oh right, the logs are below. Is there something specific you want to look at?"
283,2019-01-21T11:26:16.030900,Lawanna,That time range?
283,2019-01-21T11:26:54.031000,Lawanna,Hows this.
283,2019-01-21T11:27:36.031600,Hiroko,"ah, ok.  so, the query did execute, and none of them have errors occured"
283,2019-01-21T11:28:00.031800,Hiroko,hmm
283,2019-01-21T11:28:50.033100,Hiroko,and I assume they returned a result set
283,2019-01-21T11:29:09.033600,Hiroko,:thinking_face:
283,2019-01-21T11:30:11.034900,Lawanna,"At the end of the day though, this is all quite low level. If I implemented this scheduler, then for sure, this investigation makes sense. But this is a library and I am at the mercy of its own implementation and bugs. Unfortunately, based on the number of issues piling up, its not very well supported.

Based on this awful performance on the first day, I might have to go back to the crude loop."
283,2019-01-21T11:31:12.035300,Hiroko,the primary advantage of django-celery-beat is the django admin integration
283,2019-01-21T11:31:15.035500,Hiroko,do you need that?
283,2019-01-21T11:31:52.036400,Lawanna,"I would have thought its also the models and the structure it setups to have the scheduler based on the DB, run by beat."
283,2019-01-21T11:32:07.036800,Lawanna,"I don't use the admin too much, I look it at every now and then to check for schedule times"
283,2019-01-21T11:32:51.037500,Lawanna,and to verify if that task should have fired
283,2019-01-21T11:33:03.037700,Hiroko,:thumbsup:
283,2019-01-21T11:35:31.039500,Lawanna,"This is a core part of my app, so if you have another other suggestions for schedulers I am all for it. As far as I can tell, I can keep celery around and remove beat.

Have something else inspect the DB and keep an eye on what should fire when, and then tell celery to run it."
284,2019-01-21T10:59:45.008800,Lawanna,"Yep, on the surface celery has everything I need and more. My work load is not too crazy, compared to have I heard from other teams and read online. I'm currently curing celery beat with django-celery-beat (<https://github.com/celery/django-celery-beat>) so that I can have my tasks managed by the DB (postgres). This allows users to change schedules dynamically.

This past weekend I did a upgrade of my codebase from py2 to py3, and I switched from huey to celery and use native celery beat to handle scheduling.
Previously, I was doing a dumb loop to check for scheduled in a task that fired every minute.

I know... its not great but here is what I did.
```
#run every minute
def conditionally_run_other_tasks():
    # query database and see if some tasks should be run.
    # call the tasks in here and they will be enqueued and executed
```

Hence why I was really glad to move away from that. Having said that though, that little loop only missed a beat a couple of times a month.

I deployed celery yesterday and it has already missed about 5 tasks out of 40."
284,2019-01-21T11:05:20.011100,Clemmie,"There have been some issues in the past with celery and django-celery-beat around missing/lost periodic tasks. Are you on the most recent stable versions of everything (django, celery, django-celery-beat)?"
284,2019-01-21T11:06:18.012600,Clemmie,"Also are the tasks missed, or do you see a message in your redis log that they were dispatched but didn’t run?"
284,2019-01-21T11:08:02.015100,Lawanna,So celery should be using redis as the broker and django-celery-beat should be using Django ORM with Postgres for storing the schedules.
284,2019-01-21T11:11:55.019500,Lawanna,"So the scheduler did not send the task, I believe."

285,2019-01-21T19:46:55.051300,Hiroko,"Not really. I mean, you could do it as an internal convention "
285,2019-01-21T19:47:45.052600,Hiroko,But usually it’s just project name to whatever internal modules and packages

285,2019-01-21T19:51:00.053900,Hiroko,And won’t be implemented anytime soon

289,2019-01-22T02:01:14.080500,Leonie,`for` loops are usually slower than map and list comprehension
289,2019-01-22T02:04:28.080800,Karen,is it okay if i have some simple logic in `if __name__ == '__main__':`
289,2019-01-22T02:04:52.081100,Karen,"like this
```
    if args.rname:
        main(args.action, args.project_id, args.bucket_name, args.zone, args.rname, args.count, args.cpu, args.ram,
             args.disk_size, args.disk_size,

289,2019-01-22T02:10:47.084300,Karen,what's the difference if i pass them to main or parse them inside main?
289,2019-01-22T02:13:00.086300,Leonie,"There is this trick that you could use assuming main() calls other function that actually needs those arguments:
```
args = parser.parse_args()
some_function(**vars(args))

As for why reducing the number of args, it is readability and parsing args when you are going to use them rather than before."
289,2019-01-22T02:15:30.087600,Karen,"I see thank you :kissing_heart: I actually just saw that i repeated one argument by mistake, asking questions is so useful."
289,2019-01-22T02:16:55.088900,Leonie,"main() is normally not where actual functionality happens, but it is rather an entry point... that's another reason for deferring passing args and not blowing args list of main()"

It would be more efficient to use a generator, as other people have mentioned…
```
# return a generator of instances whose `name` name matches an entry in `names`
def search_for_instance(instances, names):
    r = re.compile(names)                                 
    return (
        instance['name']                                  
        for instance in instances                     
        if r.match(instance_name)                
    )                                       
```
but if you (a) need to use the returned list of names more than once, or (b) need to pass the list of names to something that actual
ly requires true list functionality (e.g. indexing, sorting, etc.) instead of the simpler iterator functionality, then you would nee
d to transform it into a list:
```
found_instances = list(search_for_instance(instances, names))
```"
304,2019-01-22T17:58:18.174900,Kiera,"there is one main reason this is ""more optimized"" _(which does not mean better!)_ than your original code:
In your original solution, you create the entire list of names, then filter it down by the matching names.  By using a list comprehension with a filter built-in, this solution does not populate the list with all names, but only with names that match, thus saving space and saving the time required to allocate that space."

The reason I went for it is that this scraper is the first thing I built in Python (it's a mess), so thought I'd improve it and thought I'd just use a class to clean all the mess up a bit. Regardless of my choice to use a class here, I'm still curious of the answer to my question as I face this with other scripts I'm planning to build.

316,2019-01-23T12:49:46.256300,Nery,I guess it just makes sense to mock to the level you need and have another test to assert the higher level mock if needed
317,2019-01-23T12:28:47.249500,Alfonzo,"I wasn’t sure where to ask this - if I’m including an apache 2.0 licensed requirement in my project, am I technically required to include the LICENSE file and NOTICE if I host this project on github? What if I host it only internally to my company?"
318,2019-01-23T12:38:48.253400,Lawanna,"Hey folks - I have a question about python3 and unicode handling

consider this string
```
teamName = payload['channelData']['team']['name']
```

That data is coming from an API and can contain unicode chars. So I do the following to get it into utf-8
```
teamName = payload['channelData']['team']['name'].encode('utf-8')
```

Later on I want to convert that as part of a JSON string

```
                d_kwargs = {
                    'team_name': teamName,
                }
```

here I get an error such as

```
TypeError: b'team name' is not JSON serializable
```

The solution is to do

```
                d_kwargs = {
                    'team_name': teamName.decode('utf-8'),
                }
```

But I am wondering if there is a better solution to this, rather than littering my code base with encode and decode functions. Also is there a way to catch this stuff early? before it happens in a real exception?"
318,2019-01-23T12:52:05.256800,Ashley,<@Lawanna> is there any issue with just havingg your code assume it's unicode everywhere?
318,2019-01-23T12:52:38.257000,Lawanna,Nope - don't think so
318,2019-01-23T12:53:35.257400,Ashley,then just assume it's unicode everywhere :grin:
318,2019-01-23T12:53:46.257800,Ashley,no need to bother encoding/decoding at all
318,2019-01-23T12:56:13.258300,Lawanna,Hmm - is there a way to do that? Im using Django too
318,2019-01-23T12:58:02.258800,Ashley,unicode is the default
318,2019-01-23T12:58:19.259500,Ashley,"just don't try to do any encoding/decoding, and you'll have unicode"
318,2019-01-23T12:58:34.260000,Ashley,it's different for python 2 though
318,2019-01-23T13:02:37.260600,Nenita,"I have a challenge (mainly for myself) that I haven't been able to work out. I have one idea that
would work, but have very little knowledge on servers.

The scenario: A .fdb (firebird) database that cannot be accessed over a network via a custom ODBC
driver of our software provider.

Currently I have to remote into the server just to run queries, etc. I was thinking that a way I
could achieve running sql using pyodbc is to create a server using python to setup on the network
pc and my work pc. I would use that server to send sql commands and then the network pc server would
then run that sql command and return the results. How complex/long would you think this would be to setup?

Also, any other ideas to do this?"
318,2019-01-23T13:03:52.261300,Ashley,you can't just tunnel into the server?
318,2019-01-23T13:04:22.262000,Nenita,"servers are not my forte, but I've always wanted to delve into it."
318,2019-01-23T13:04:26.262200,Ashley,like SSH
318,2019-01-23T13:04:49.262900,Lawanna,Just create a reverse ssh tunnel
318,2019-01-23T13:04:54.263100,Ashley,"SSH is a network protocol (""Secure SHell"")"
318,2019-01-23T13:06:10.265400,Nenita,Is that the same as remoting in or would is it solely for sending commands?
318,2019-01-23T13:06:14.265600,Ashley,an SSH Tunnel is a where you punch a secure hole into a server from another node so you can run reach it over a network
318,2019-01-23T13:06:22.266000,Ashley,SSH is very similar to remoting
318,2019-01-23T13:06:48.266900,Lawanna,"Also <@Ashley> so I first had to encode because I was doing this

```
""{site}/connect/{teamName}"".format(
                teamName=teamName
            )
````

Where teamName was a unicode string. and I got the error `'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xf3' in position 13: ordinal not in range(128)`

So I had to decode it."
318,2019-01-23T13:07:05.267400,Ashley,SSH on it's own is basically letting you open up a shell/terminal/command prompt on another machinne over a network so you can run things as though you were on that server
318,2019-01-23T13:07:51.268900,Nenita,"don't mean to be antsy, but if i had ssh setup, how would pyodbc, or any other module for that manner, to work with the database?"
318,2019-01-23T13:08:04.269200,Nenita,shoot you answered too fast lol
318,2019-01-23T13:08:28.269800,Ashley,"to explain SSH tunneling, let's say I have a DB on server A, but it's behind a firewall. I can't reach server A directly, so I SSH into server B which is on the same network as server A, but not bound by the same firewall rules"
318,2019-01-23T13:08:54.270400,Ashley,"once I SSH into server B, I can SSH into server A"
318,2019-01-23T13:08:58.270500,Nenita,oh so its basically what i was wanting to create in python?
318,2019-01-23T13:09:15.271000,Nenita,basically a backdoor server
318,2019-01-23T13:09:41.271600,Ashley,"an SSH Tunnel is a tool that basically does this for you, but usually for specific ports (like more complex port forwarding)"
318,2019-01-23T13:10:00.272100,Nenita,"im surprised i've never heard of ssh, but this is exciting news"
318,2019-01-23T13:10:11.272300,Ashley,"a backdoor _into the_ server, yes"
318,2019-01-23T13:10:13.272600,Nenita,:nerd_face:
318,2019-01-23T13:10:26.272900,Ashley,it's incredibly common
318,2019-01-23T13:10:33.273100,Ashley,almost required
318,2019-01-23T13:10:42.273400,Ashley,you would do yourself a huge favor to learn it
318,2019-01-23T13:11:16.274000,Nenita,thats what im doing now. im going to be spending a lot of my time now setting this up. I can do everything i need to at my job through python except for accessing our main db
318,2019-01-23T13:13:08.275100,Ashley,"<@Lawanna> I would try to figuure out what in that code snippet was the actual ascii string, and try to trace it back to its source. If you're working in python 3, ascii shouldn't be cropping up like that"
318,2019-01-23T13:13:37.275700,Ashley,"also, I would just bring it up to unicode's level so the rest of your code is easier to work with"
318,2019-01-23T13:15:04.276800,Ashley,"<@Nenita> there's a ton of tools for SSH tunneling that make it pretty easy to work with. If you can get your hands on someone from devops for like 5 minutes, they should be able to heklp you set it up"
318,2019-01-23T13:16:01.277500,Lawanna,"Oh right - so from the requests library, from a payload response."
318,2019-01-23T13:16:11.277900,Lawanna,A json being converted to python dict
318,2019-01-23T13:16:14.278100,Nenita,"yea, it seems relatively easy to setup, but just researching now on how I would run sql statements through it"
318,2019-01-23T13:17:11.279000,Ashley,<@Lawanna> json and requests support unicode. I think there's another entity throwing in ascii somewhere
318,2019-01-23T13:17:29.279400,Ashley,do you have any comments on the tops of any of your python files that mention ascii?
318,2019-01-23T13:17:59.280000,Lawanna,"```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```"
318,2019-01-23T13:18:04.280200,Lawanna,that is on the file
318,2019-01-23T13:19:01.281600,Ashley,"<@Nenita> databases are queried usually by connecting to some hosted service designated by a port, so really you just need to worry about what port your DB expects a connection on, and what port you want to bind to your tunnel on your local machine (also the ports for the middle man)"
318,2019-01-23T13:19:17.282000,Lawanna,"The flow is fairly simple in this case

```
        response = s.post(
            url=""%sv3/conversations"" % self.serviceUrl, 
            headers={
                ""Authorization"": ""Bearer {token}"".format(token=self.token),

            )

318,2019-01-23T13:19:31.282400,Lawanna,"Nothing else, just that comment on top"
318,2019-01-23T13:19:45.282700,Ashley,I think `teamName` may be the culprit
318,2019-01-23T13:20:20.283300,Ashley,"try printing out the raw response that requests gets, i.e. `print(response.text)`"

318,2019-01-23T13:24:02.285400,Ashley,"<@Nenita> to give a quick example, PostgreSQL uses a default port of 5432, so if I have a PSQL server running locally, I could connect to it with something like `psql localhost:5432` (I forget the actual syntax)"
318,2019-01-23T13:24:09.285600,Ashley,but I would run that in my shell
318,2019-01-23T13:25:05.287000,Nenita,"im surprised through much research in the past, I had never found this type of solution. thanks very much for all the info."

320,2019-01-23T14:22:56.294700,Carlo,<@Hiroko> 3.4 asyncio is some preliminary version IIRC
320,2019-01-23T14:23:14.295100,Carlo,e.g. used decorators and `yield from` syntax for coroutines

327,2019-01-23T20:23:50.310600,Sau,"hi guys

just have a quick quesion
Assume there is a Mac and a HP computer each has an Intel microprocessor. Would an assembly program produced using the Mac computer run on the HP computer? (edited)
I think it would be yes, but not sure about the OS
I wonder if the OS can affect to assembly"
327,2019-01-23T20:28:01.312400,Sasha,"The actual assembly instructions would be basically the same, but in practice you're probably going to run into problems with the executable format, for instance... a Windows .EXE and a MacOS .APP will be different for the OS to load and run them."
327,2019-01-23T20:28:45.312900,Sasha,"And of course almost anything the program does will need to involve system calls for input and output, etc."
327,2019-01-23T20:42:58.313400,Sau,hmm
327,2019-01-23T20:43:01.313700,Sau,interesting
327,2019-01-23T20:43:28.315000,Sau,so I guess I can run assembly on different OS as long as I have the same CPU
327,2019-01-23T20:43:49.315500,Hiroko,"Agreed. If your just doing register and accumulator arithmetic, yes the code will be portable. But you would need the os to execute the asm code "
327,2019-01-23T20:44:19.316100,Hiroko,And that would require os specific compilation. 
327,2019-01-23T20:44:52.317200,Hiroko,"If you're thinking of doing osx and Linux, I think the chances of more portability are greater, since osx is a Unix based system "
327,2019-01-23T20:45:12.317900,Hiroko,"Windows, however, is definitely most certainly not a Unix system "
327,2019-01-23T20:46:14.319000,Sau,"so <@Hiroko> the assembly code is still portable however I don’t know why the executable format be the problem. As long as the code runs and compiles and computes what I want it to do, then would it be good to go ?"
327,2019-01-23T20:46:39.319200,Hiroko,You can try it 
327,2019-01-23T20:46:44.319500,Hiroko,But I doubt it
327,2019-01-23T20:47:01.320100,Hiroko,Because the asm code is just a small part of the problem 
327,2019-01-23T20:47:24.320800,Hiroko,The way programs are executed is very different between operating systems 
327,2019-01-23T20:48:17.321000,Sau,ah I see
327,2019-01-23T20:49:03.322700,Sau,"if your theory is right, then the Executable format will not make the AS code to be running on different OS"
327,2019-01-23T20:50:12.324400,Kiera,"specifically, the way programs are *loaded* by the OS into memory, with the memory manager set up for the address space.  also, most programs don't really have much effect if they can't do I/O or interact at all, and that's going to require invoking kernel functions, which can be wildly different between OSes."
327,2019-01-23T20:50:43.325000,Sasha,"The ""compile"" part is where you need to specify to compile into _what_... an EXE, an ELF, etc."
327,2019-01-23T20:55:36.326000,Sau,so pretty much the OS is hugely affecting the way of the Assembly code can run.
327,2019-01-23T20:55:52.326700,Hiroko,How else can it be?
327,2019-01-23T20:56:43.327800,Sau,I guess that is it . The only thing that I concern is to have the same Assembly code running on Mac and Windows
327,2019-01-23T20:57:02.328400,Sau,I have all of them running on x86 the same CPU
327,2019-01-23T20:57:25.329400,Hiroko,You can try but I seriously doubt you'll come close to success 
327,2019-01-23T20:58:08.330700,Hiroko,Cpu architecture is just a small part of what you're working with 
327,2019-01-23T20:58:16.330900,Sau,I see
327,2019-01-23T21:00:04.332700,Sasha,I think the function calling conventions for register use might even be different.
327,2019-01-23T21:03:22.334300,Hiroko,Essentially <@Sau> you have to compile per operating system you want to run on. The differences are too drastic to expect one compile to run on another system 
327,2019-01-23T21:06:03.335700,Hiroko,"I mean, even rollercoaster tycoon, which was 99% x86 asm, had to be compiled for the different platforms it was released for "
327,2019-01-23T21:06:48.336000,Hiroko,"&gt;&gt;&gt;Sawyer wrote 99% of the code for RollerCoaster Tycoon in x86 assembly language, with the remaining one percent written in C.[2] The graphics were designed by artist Simon Foster using several 3D modeling, rendering, and paint programs.[2] For his efforts, Sawyer made around $30 million in revenue.[4] The Xbox port was handled by Frontier Developments, who would later go on to develop later titles in the series."
327,2019-01-23T21:21:39.336600,Sasha,Tackling a project of that magnitude in assembly is... yikes.
328,2019-01-23T22:58:46.338900,Clayton,What is the equivalent of  pandas df.head()  in a python variable ? would it be just a slice or is there a function ?
328,2019-01-23T23:01:51.339200,Sasha,"Yeah, I think a slice would be the usual equivalent."
328,2019-01-23T23:03:28.339800,Sasha,Also `itertools.islice()` if you have an iterator that doesn't support slicing.

330,2019-01-24T07:30:47.356700,Valeri,<@Jung> That' right but what does the `devices` package do is what we meant to ask
331,2019-01-24T06:14:11.347400,Kiera,This looks like you have something in your `.bashrc` or other shell configuration script that is generating output even for non-interactive sessions.
331,2019-01-24T06:17:57.347600,Conrad,"<@Kiera> I googled ""non interactive shell session python output"" and got <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35849587/run-multiple-commands-in-a-non-interactive-shell-session-and-parse-the-output> which seems similar to the problem I was facing.
I got fed up with that approach and decided to lookup the /proc filesystem instead. gives me what I need."
331,2019-01-24T06:21:07.348600,Valeri,You can't install it using `pip`
331,2019-01-24T06:21:47.349400,Conrad,"of course, I should probably read about how generating output for non-interactive sessions caused me problems, but I'd already spent 2 hours on that crap."

333,2019-01-24T09:14:03.359300,Mica,you'd have to do something like `'phil': {'age': 22}`

334,2019-01-24T10:26:54.361500,Nenita,anyone familiar with paramiko?
334,2019-01-24T10:50:57.362400,Lindsey,<@Nenita> a bit 
334,2019-01-24T10:52:20.363800,Nenita,"well to be specific in my circumstance, i am having an issue getting a connection going but Im getting and error that port (whatever port I type in) is not found on ip 127.0.0.1. Can't tell if I need ssh setup on my pc first or what, but I am trying to use paramiko locally to learn"
334,2019-01-24T10:59:55.364700,Lindsey,"Well if the port isn’t open on localhost it won’t be able to connect to it, AFAIK"
334,2019-01-24T11:01:06.365600,Lindsey,"Try running SSHD and verify the port is open, then try again "
334,2019-01-24T11:12:26.366800,Nenita,well i tried ssh 127.0.0.1 in cmd and it gave connection refused
334,2019-01-24T11:13:36.367300,Nenita,through research i found its impossible to run ssh and send ssh all with a local machine. im getting ubuntu and virtualbox because people have been able to ssh with it. found here: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13201624/execute-local-python-script-over-sshclient-with-paramiko-in-remote-machine>
334,2019-01-24T11:13:56.367600,Nenita,and here <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/145997/trying-to-ssh-to-local-vm-ubuntu-with-putty>
334,2019-01-24T11:15:22.368300,Lindsey,The second link is wrong. 127.0.0.1 isn’t the IP of a VM when you are SSHing in from the host.
334,2019-01-24T11:15:31.368600,Lindsey,That’s why it failed for that person 
334,2019-01-24T11:15:34.368800,Lindsey,Checking first one
334,2019-01-24T11:18:19.369500,Nenita,ill be checking the ips when its all up anyway
334,2019-01-24T11:18:44.370000,Nenita,so its fine if the ip's are different/wrong in various links
334,2019-01-24T11:18:56.370500,Nenita,"i know i won't be able to replicate it 100%, but it gives me direcitno"
334,2019-01-24T11:19:16.370700,Lindsey,Also debatable on the second one
334,2019-01-24T11:20:02.372100,Lindsey,Because you can do: `ssh user@host ls -lah` and it will execute that command on the remote server and return the results to you
334,2019-01-24T11:20:09.372400,Lindsey,So you could mimic that behavior 
334,2019-01-24T11:20:49.372600,Lindsey,<https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/960>
334,2019-01-24T11:21:04.373000,Lindsey,That person was trying what I am describing

334,2019-01-24T11:23:21.374900,Lindsey,"So for your test, you _can_ run SSHD and ssh in to 127.0.0.1, if SSHD is actually running on local host. If it’s running in a VM you’d get the IP of the VM to ssh from host to guest "
334,2019-01-24T11:24:21.375600,Nenita,i saw that 2nd link on google results but never looked at it. but now i should have
334,2019-01-24T11:25:20.376400,Nenita,"this is a work computer and i doubt they'd care if i setup ssh on this pc, but i'd just use a vm to make things more manageable for our IT guy (so he doesn't have to mess with it)."
334,2019-01-24T11:26:23.377300,Lindsey,If i were you I’d be doing it in a VM anyway. Or at least some form of actual test environment :).
334,2019-01-24T11:27:49.377800,Nenita,"yea, after all that research I was like ""wait. I can probably do this on a vm."""
334,2019-01-24T12:16:44.380100,Nenita,"currently doing that  and i was like man, it'd be cool to have 1 link as a reference for the most fundamental things"
334,2019-01-24T12:17:33.380500,Hiroko,"problem is, that’s like having a one link for everything in windows or osx"

336,2019-01-24T13:16:03.389200,Clemmie,References the current users home directory. `~` is equivalent to `/home/me` or whoever you are logged in as

337,2019-01-24T16:57:44.392700,Claudine,you're using `if` statements incorrectly
337,2019-01-24T16:57:56.393200,Rodrick,Yeah?
337,2019-01-24T16:57:57.393300,Claudine,"they need a body
```
if (statement):
   do a thing
```"
337,2019-01-24T16:58:03.393500,Rodrick,ok
337,2019-01-24T16:58:30.394100,Hiroko,do you know any other language?
337,2019-01-24T16:58:30.394200,Claudine,i don't know that you'll get the expected behavior out of your `try` statement like that
337,2019-01-24T16:59:08.395000,Claudine,"also if you want to check if those are integers you can try `isinstance(num1, int)`"
337,2019-01-24T16:59:13.395200,Claudine,that will return a yes or no
337,2019-01-24T16:59:19.395500,Rodrick,ok
337,2019-01-24T16:59:32.395900,Rodrick,I'll do that
337,2019-01-24T17:00:11.396700,Claudine,"```
if (isinstance(num1, int) &amp;&amp; isinstance(num2, int)):
    your things are integers so do what you want here
else:
   your things are not integers so handle that appropriately
```"
337,2019-01-24T17:00:22.396900,Claudine,that may work out easier for ya
337,2019-01-24T17:02:05.398300,Claudine,"`if int(num1) == num1:` i think would fail if num1 was any number cast as a string, so like the string `12345` would fail even though it can represent a valid number, So you'll want to make sure your `num1` and `num2` are the correct type"
337,2019-01-24T17:02:16.398500,Rodrick,Ok
337,2019-01-24T17:02:54.399100,Claudine,"then again if you try to cast a string representation of an integer to an int, and that string does not represent an integer youll probably fail too"

338,2019-01-24T17:56:55.404700,Marc,and then keep doing until all the combinations are in a list?

340,2019-01-24T19:24:37.414900,Sasha,"Easiest way I can think of to do it is to loop through range(2^n), and set each character to upper or lower case based on the i-th bit in the counter value."
340,2019-01-24T19:28:37.415300,Sasha,"Basically the same as counting in binary, with 0=lower, 1=upper."
340,2019-01-24T19:59:03.415600,Sasha,"Yeah, a recursive solution would also work. Iterative nested loops are difficult if you don't know in advance how many letters you have."
340,2019-01-24T21:23:54.416600,Kiera,"or use a recursive generator function...
```
def casePermutations(word):
    if word:
        for restOfWord in casePermutations(word[1:]):
             yield word[0].lower() + restOfWord
             yield word[0].upper() + restOfWord
    else:
        yield ''
```
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(casePermutations('foo'))
['foo', 'Foo', 'fOo', 'FOo', 'foO', 'FoO', 'fOO', 'FOO']
```
_(This needs a bit more logic if it accepts words with non-alphabetic characters; i'll leave that as an exercise for the reader :) )_"
340,2019-01-24T21:27:51.416900,Kiera,guess i should have read this first :)
340,2019-01-24T21:32:19.417100,Sasha,Heh. Good to post the code in the channel regardless.
341,2019-01-24T19:56:24.415400,Myron,"Wouldn’t a nested loop achieve that? For each letter, loop for each remaining letter, using both a capital and small version of each letter. As this will create some combinations twice, you save results in a `set()`, which ensures you don’t get duplicates."
342,2019-01-25T03:47:59.422200,Valeri,"I've used `spyne` to build a SOAP server.
And that's how my request looks like.
```

342,2019-01-25T03:48:24.422600,Valeri,What I get is `&lt;Element action at 0x7f8fe04988c8&gt;`
342,2019-01-25T03:48:34.422900,Valeri,What I expect is my xml payload
342,2019-01-25T03:49:05.423600,Valeri,I'm missing out on something. New to SOAP.
343,2019-01-25T05:02:03.424400,Yaeko,`&lt;Element action at 0x7f8fe04988c8&gt;` looks very much like you are printing/serializing an actual object
343,2019-01-25T05:02:19.424900,Yaeko,And not the text/request/whatever content from an attribute or method belonging to that object

346,2019-01-25T07:17:24.428900,Hiroko,you can’t compare groups directly like that
346,2019-01-25T07:17:38.429400,Hiroko,"so, you have the variable"
346,2019-01-25T07:17:42.429700,Rodrick,What do you mean?
346,2019-01-25T07:17:44.429800,Hiroko,the first comparison goes through

346,2019-01-25T07:18:00.430300,Hiroko,compare 2 with what?  you don’t specify
346,2019-01-25T07:18:07.430500,Rodrick,"Oh, ok"
346,2019-01-25T07:18:13.430900,Rodrick,I see

346,2019-01-25T07:19:00.431700,Rodrick,Like that?
346,2019-01-25T07:19:19.432200,Hiroko,"yep, or you could do `if xfac1 in [1, 2, 3, 4]:`"
346,2019-01-25T07:19:25.432400,Rodrick,OK
346,2019-01-25T07:19:29.432700,Rodrick,Ok*
346,2019-01-25T07:19:41.433100,Rodrick,I'll try it
346,2019-01-25T07:19:44.433300,Hiroko,but also note what you’re passing in for a value to `xfac1`
346,2019-01-25T07:19:55.433600,Hiroko,you’re setting it as 6
346,2019-01-25T07:20:25.434100,Hiroko,"so with the revised statement, you will be skipping over that one"
346,2019-01-25T07:20:42.434300,Rodrick,Ok
346,2019-01-25T07:22:34.434600,Rodrick,That worked thanks.

352,2019-01-25T11:29:16.467300,Keva,"if, hypothetically, i will need to use that variable later in that function"
352,2019-01-25T11:30:07.468100,Keva,will that second variable actually use the first variable?
352,2019-01-25T11:30:24.468800,Keva,(maybe i'm getting something wrong
352,2019-01-25T11:33:06.471100,Clemmie,"I’m not sure the memory address thing is meaningful. I forget the exact set of numbers, but for at least the first few integers python does not create a new object (each integer has a fixed address, and is shared. Also 0 is false, so double confusion possible there) If you change that initializing alpha to, say 1000 I think your different memory location would go away"
352,2019-01-25T11:34:32.471600,Keva,"oh, you're right"
352,2019-01-25T11:34:39.471900,Keva,thank you! :slightly_smiling_face:

352,2019-01-25T12:20:18.480600,Cammie,"I seem to always have issues with virutal environments with python.

I’m attemtping to create a new virtual environment in my project’s repo by using

`$ python3 -m venv venv`

Then I attempt to activate the virtual envrionment by using

`$ source ./venv/bin/activate`

I’m having issues install packages using pip3, I’m getting errors that say:

&gt; Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: ‘/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/prompt_toolkit-1.0.15.dist-info/DESCRIPTION.rst’                                                                                                 │·
&gt; Consider using the `--user` option or check the permissions.

So I looked at which pip3 i’m using with

`$ which pip3`

and I get

&gt; /usr/local/bin/pip3

*This is confusing to me. Shouldn’t my pip3 be that of my virtual env?*
*Should I be using pip instead of pip3?*"
352,2019-01-25T12:24:14.481200,Hiroko,what does `which pip` return?

352,2019-01-25T12:27:27.482400,Carrol,what about `echo $PATH`? Should have your path to virtualenv first
352,2019-01-25T12:34:12.482800,Cammie,"I believe that is correct, the first value is:

352,2019-01-25T12:44:22.490700,Hiroko,you might want to look through your dotfiles that are loaded by your shell
352,2019-01-25T12:44:36.491200,Hiroko,most lkely there’s something in there that’s env related
352,2019-01-25T12:49:48.493400,Carrol,if it’s a PATH issue you can start by resetting your PATH: `export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` and then activating the venv again. if that gets things working you can fix your PATH permanently in your dotfiles
352,2019-01-25T13:03:07.499900,Hiroko,<@Janey> that’s against slack’s free tier terms of service
352,2019-01-25T13:03:20.500500,Carrol,yeah changing the path doesn’t change the rest of your environment
352,2019-01-25T13:03:53.501600,Clemmie,"<@Janey> and message history is not on a per-user basis. Either the entire slack is paid (per user, but every user is paid for) or not"

355,2019-01-25T11:47:56.474400,Yaeko,<@Nenita> I don't understand. You have a string containing `\n` and it's not printed to a new line when you use `print()`?

359,2019-01-25T14:18:01.531800,Alvina,the format I am looking for is
359,2019-01-25T14:18:16.532300,Alvina,"col1, col2, col3, values"
359,2019-01-25T14:18:27.532600,Alvina,"where values is all other columns aside from col1, col2, col3"

359,2019-01-25T14:22:07.533800,Alvina,"that works in PG, but I'd like to do something similar with a dataframe"
359,2019-01-25T14:22:27.534400,Alvina,"I am not looking to load the data to PG, but rather create a JSON file in that format"
359,2019-01-25T14:24:41.535000,Nenita,"anyone familiar with paramiko? I'm sending a test command, but the data received is weird and looks maybe encoded?"

359,2019-01-25T14:25:39.535800,Hiroko,"not sure, <@Alvina>.  I know pandas also has a `to_json` method for data frames"
359,2019-01-25T14:25:50.536100,Hiroko,maybe <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science> would be a better place?
359,2019-01-25T14:31:22.537000,Sasha,"<@Nenita> That looks like ""ESC [2J"", a terminal clear-screen escape sequence. I don't know why you're getting it, though."
360,2019-01-25T14:37:07.538100,Sasha,"Do you need to send a `""\n""` with your command? Possibly you're only getting an initial connection-setup response instead of the `ipconfig` output."
360,2019-01-25T14:51:45.538200,Jimmy,"AFAIK it's not saving the messages the problem, it's the building a gui with search on top that compete with slack"
360,2019-01-25T14:52:31.538400,Jimmy,this is one of the reason we don't have a something similar for this team

361,2019-01-25T15:26:15.542400,Coleen,if 'WORD' in open('example.txt').read():
361,2019-01-25T15:26:18.542700,Coleen,right?
361,2019-01-25T15:29:28.542900,Claudine,ahh
361,2019-01-25T15:29:40.543300,Claudine,check out the `with` syntax for reading line by line
361,2019-01-25T15:30:20.544300,Claudine,"```
with open('filename.txt) as file:
    for line in file:
        print line
```"
361,2019-01-25T15:30:30.544500,Claudine,that'll parse your file line by line
361,2019-01-25T15:30:46.544900,Claudine,instead of `print line` just do a substring match
361,2019-01-25T15:31:32.545700,Claudine,"```
with open('filename.txt) as file:
    for line in file:
        if 'WORD' in line:
            #the word exists in this line, and thus the file
```"
361,2019-01-25T15:32:43.547000,Claudine,"you can do your processing withing that if statement, or set a flag saying you found the word and then do your processing outside of that whole thing"
361,2019-01-25T16:03:16.549000,Kiera,"<@Coleen> your attempt (`if 'WORD' in open('example.txt').read():`) would work, but has the drawback of having to load the entire file into memory at once, then doing a string search over the entire file.  <@Claudine>’s solution does the search line by line, both reducing memory usage and speeding the process up by only reading up to the point where you've found [a line with] the word."
361,2019-01-25T16:05:37.550300,Sasha,"Note that both approaches are just substring matches, so would also flag ""Edword"", etc. If you want whole-word matches, you want <@Claudine>’s expertise in regexes.  :grin:"
361,2019-01-25T16:11:44.550700,Claudine,Indeed REGEX would do it 
362,2019-01-25T16:36:40.551200,Coleen,And if I want to do it line-by line but starting from the end of the file?
362,2019-01-25T16:38:41.551800,Nenita,anyone familiar with any modules for ssh? i cannot get multiple commands to be sent. I'm having the hardest time
362,2019-01-25T16:39:50.552300,Coleen,I mean line by line is better but I know the string will be towards the end of a long file.
362,2019-01-25T16:40:18.552400,Nenita,"i read into subprocess, but haven't seen a solution as to send commands rather send commands to my own pc"
362,2019-01-25T17:05:12.554900,Sasha,Unless the file is very long (megabytes) that probably won't be super efficient since disk drives are optimized for reading sequentially.
362,2019-01-25T17:42:55.555300,Coleen,:+1:
363,2019-01-25T17:51:38.555900,Hugh,Have yu guys used onesaml package in Python
364,2019-01-25T18:41:26.556900,Chanell,"Reading the file backwards would likely be inefficient, as EdKeyes mentions, but reading the file sequentially starting from the middle or end might still be good (if you're pretty sure it's going to be towards the end).  If you do want to do that `seek` is potentially what you're looking for."
365,2019-01-25T19:52:07.557800,Elza,Hello all I have been trying to get help with an import error that I having in my project
365,2019-01-25T20:01:21.558000,Chanell,What's the error?
365,2019-01-25T20:28:32.558200,Elza,ImportError: No module named bs4
365,2019-01-25T20:29:46.558400,Elza,"I used this code to import it

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup4"
365,2019-01-25T20:29:58.558800,Elza,"I swear it is imported, its mad annoying dealing with it lol"
365,2019-01-25T20:34:05.559500,Ashley,<@Elza> do you have bs4 installed?
365,2019-01-25T20:36:19.560000,Elza,its beautifulsoup4 which I did installed
365,2019-01-25T20:38:43.560200,Ashley,you sure?
365,2019-01-25T20:39:10.560800,Ashley,make sure the python env you're using to run your script has it installed
365,2019-01-25T20:41:35.561000,Elza,how do I check that?
365,2019-01-25T20:42:10.561300,Ashley,how are you running your script?
365,2019-01-25T20:45:36.562400,Elza,Im just running it as python gsearch.py ‘site:<http://jnequipment.com|jnequipment.com>’
365,2019-01-25T20:46:09.563300,Ashley,run `python -m pip freeze`
365,2019-01-25T20:46:38.563700,Elza,which seems to works so far. What I am trying to do is to have a web crawler crawl all the website pages on google search and see which ones are dead or live
365,2019-01-25T20:46:40.563900,Elza,"backports.functools-lru-cache==1.5

365,2019-01-25T20:46:46.564200,Elza,THat what I got when I ran the command
365,2019-01-25T20:49:42.564600,Ashley,"from that same terminal, try to run your script again"
365,2019-01-25T20:50:50.564800,Elza,Thats what I did
365,2019-01-25T20:50:56.565100,Ashley,same error?
365,2019-01-25T20:51:18.565700,Elza,I get an error when I run python2 which is my shortcut for running python 2
365,2019-01-25T20:51:29.566000,Elza,but when I run python then my command it works.
365,2019-01-25T20:51:34.566200,Ashley,yep
365,2019-01-25T20:51:58.566600,Ashley,what happens when you run `python --version`
365,2019-01-25T20:52:09.566900,Elza,2.7.15
365,2019-01-25T20:52:15.567100,Elza,"Python 2.7.15 :: Anaconda, Inc."
365,2019-01-25T20:52:38.567800,Ashley,and when you run `python2 --version`?
365,2019-01-25T20:52:53.568000,Elza,I get Python 2.7.15
365,2019-01-25T20:54:15.569100,Ashley,"so, to be clear, when you run `python --version`, it spits out `Python 2.7.15 :: Anaconda, Inc.`, and when you run `python2 --version`, you get `Python 2.7.15`, correct?"
365,2019-01-25T20:55:04.569600,Elza,well its actually py2 I apologize
365,2019-01-25T20:55:11.569900,Elza,which is this py2=“/usr/local/bin/python2”
365,2019-01-25T20:55:57.570700,Ashley,"ok, either way, it looks like those are different python executables, meaning different environments"
365,2019-01-25T20:56:13.571200,Ashley,"one has `bs4` installed, and the other doesn't"
365,2019-01-25T20:57:07.571400,Elza,ah I see
365,2019-01-25T20:57:27.571900,Elza,Another question is dotenv a builtin module from python?
365,2019-01-25T20:58:26.572100,Ashley,I don't believe so
365,2019-01-25T20:58:35.572300,Elza,ok
365,2019-01-25T21:00:05.572500,Elza,huh thanks for the help
365,2019-01-25T21:17:01.572700,Ashley,np
366,2019-01-25T21:59:00.572800,Chester,Yes
367,2019-01-26T02:03:02.573200,Conchita,"Thanks for this, will try to implement an iterator protocol!"
367,2019-01-26T02:19:32.574500,Conchita,"For one of my apps that is meant to run continously, I noticed it stopped running. When I ssh into my server I see the screen session from where I was running the app is `deattached`"
367,2019-01-26T02:20:22.575400,Conchita,"Excluding human interaction, what could lead to a screen becoming `deattached`?"
367,2019-01-26T02:23:42.576500,Sasha,I think that would happen if the ssh connection the screen was started from got disconnected. Normally you would purposefully detach the screen session so it would continue to run while you're not on a live connection.
367,2019-01-26T02:25:18.577100,Conchita,How do you purposefully detach the screen session to allow it to run after I log off?
367,2019-01-26T02:25:40.577400,Sasha,"CTRL+A D, I believe."
367,2019-01-26T02:27:36.577900,Sasha,You should be able to reattach to the old screen session and see if your app printed out any errors.
367,2019-01-26T02:28:09.578500,Conchita,"Ok thanks, will try it out. Have a :taco: <@Sasha>"
368,2019-01-26T10:29:58.581100,Roxanne,Can anybody help me wiith this one ? <https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212270/api-client-querying-data-out-of-an-endpoint>
369,2019-01-26T11:13:04.582500,Coleen,"Guys perhaps you could help me out a bit to flesh out a class that would implement a certain behaviour. So basically the way I want to use it is:
```
MyData['zero']['excited'].method() 
```"
369,2019-01-26T11:13:42.583200,Coleen,"The backstory is that I use a nested dict so far, and I want to add some methods to it."
369,2019-01-26T11:15:13.583700,Coleen,"The dict is
```
MYDATA = { # mapping from executable names to what they represent
    'zero' : {
        'ground' : 'dish',
        'excited' : 'ztes'
    },
    'finite' : {
        'ground' : 'skys',
        'excited' : 'ftes' 
    }
}
```"
369,2019-01-26T11:25:56.584800,Coleen,Why not learn both at the same time: <http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html>
369,2019-01-26T11:29:06.586600,Chester,<@Coleen> what kinds of methods?
369,2019-01-26T11:32:49.587400,Coleen,"Yea so for example the kind of stuff I'm doing with the nested dict right now:
```
    # check if input files are present in the workspace
    for temp in ('zero', 'finite'):
        for state, suffix in zip(('ground', 'excited'), (""_dis.dat"", ""_start.dat"")):
            fpath = os.path.join(args.workspace, CODE_NAME[temp][state] + suffix)
            if not os.path.isfile(fpath):
                sys.exit(f""{fpath} not found, exiting."")
```"
369,2019-01-26T11:33:57.588100,Coleen,"There could be a method `input_file()` which returns the corresponding file name, ie `MyData['zero']['ground'].input_file()` would return `dish_dis.dat`,"
369,2019-01-26T11:37:28.588600,Coleen,"Not sure it's the right abstraction, but something like this is what I had in mind."
369,2019-01-26T11:38:57.590200,Coleen,"Then another method `MyData.all_input_files()` would return a list containing all input file names: [`dish_dis,dat`, `skys_dis,dat`, `ztes_start.dat`, `ftes_start.dat`]"
369,2019-01-26T11:43:44.591500,Coleen,"Or `MyData['zero'].input_files()` would return  `[dish_dis,dat, ztes_start.dat]` and
`MyData['ground'].input_files()` would return `[dish_dis,dat, skys_dis,dat]`"
369,2019-01-26T11:45:37.591800,Coleen,Does it make sense?
369,2019-01-26T11:47:34.593100,Chester,"That syntax is possible due to dynamic nature of python, but I would advise to implement a more common api:
instead of `MyData['zero']['ground'].input_file()` do `MyData.input_file('zero', 'ground')`"
369,2019-01-26T11:48:43.593500,Chester,Same for `MyData['zero'].input_files()`: do `MyData.input_files('zero')` instead
369,2019-01-26T11:48:55.593700,Coleen,I see.
369,2019-01-26T11:49:09.594100,Coleen,And I would store the nested dict inside the class right?
369,2019-01-26T11:49:13.594300,Chester,Yes
369,2019-01-26T11:50:31.595400,Chester,"```
class MyData:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self._data = data
    def input_file(self, first, second):
        return self._data[first][second] + '_dis.dat'
```
Something like that."
369,2019-01-26T11:50:43.595600,Coleen,:slightly_smiling_face:
369,2019-01-26T11:51:38.596800,Chester,"Btw, there is nothing wrong with not having methods on your `MyData` class and write functions instead, that operate on dictionaries"
369,2019-01-26T11:52:03.597100,Coleen,what do you mean?
369,2019-01-26T11:53:17.598400,Chester,"```
def input_file(data, first, second):
    return data[first][second] + '_dis.dat'
```"
369,2019-01-26T11:53:27.598700,Chester,Where `data` is your dictionary
369,2019-01-26T11:53:41.599100,Coleen,Oh you mean not writing a class at all
369,2019-01-26T11:53:45.599300,Chester,Exactly
369,2019-01-26T11:54:02.599900,Coleen,But I feel the dict and these functions belong together.
369,2019-01-26T11:54:52.600500,Chester,"Maybe, maybe not - you can always refactor a bunch of functions into a class later."
369,2019-01-26T11:55:12.601100,Coleen,"And since the nested dict was a global constant before, should I make this class a singleton?"
369,2019-01-26T11:55:20.601300,Chester,"Extracting methods from classes, on the other hand, may be difficult because of uncontrollable implicit dependencies on `self`"
369,2019-01-26T11:56:02.601900,Chester,"You see, singletons are a thing in java, but in python there is nothing wrong with a regular global variable :slightly_smiling_face:"
369,2019-01-26T11:56:24.602600,Chester,"Because of how imports work in python, you get singleton behavior out of the box"
369,2019-01-26T11:56:30.602800,Coleen,"Yes, but if the variable becomes a class?"
369,2019-01-26T11:57:07.603900,Chester,"You'll need to instantiate it somewhere, yeah. `my_data = MyData()`. And only then you'll be able to call methods on `my_data`"
369,2019-01-26T11:57:38.604400,Coleen,But the problem is I will have to instantiate it at the top level of the module.
369,2019-01-26T11:57:46.604700,Chester,Why is this a problem?
369,2019-01-26T11:57:52.604900,Coleen,Because it's used in various functions.
369,2019-01-26T11:58:03.605300,Coleen,Because it creates a global var.
369,2019-01-26T11:58:41.605700,Coleen,"So I read global constants are OK in Python, but not global vars?"
369,2019-01-26T11:59:09.606100,Chester,Uhm
369,2019-01-26T11:59:45.607000,Chester,There are no constants in python
369,2019-01-26T12:00:47.608100,Ashley,"<@Coleen> global constants are fine in Python because they are unchanging, hence the name ""constant"", but global variables are a code smell (usually) because things in multiple parts of your code migght depend on those things and have to change them, but you can't know which parts will do so, or when they'll do it, so it opens you up to a whole mess of problems"
369,2019-01-26T12:00:59.608400,Ashley,<@Chester> is right that there are no constants in python
369,2019-01-26T12:01:09.608700,Ashley,but you can create objects that you treat as constants
369,2019-01-26T12:01:24.609000,Ashley,and that's fine
369,2019-01-26T12:01:27.609400,Coleen,how
369,2019-01-26T12:01:36.609800,Ashley,"you'll see that commonly done to avoid things like ""magic numbers"""
369,2019-01-26T12:01:53.610400,Coleen,by giving them a name in capitals? :slightly_smiling_face:
369,2019-01-26T12:02:00.610700,Ashley,you just create an object in the global namespace of a module like any other
369,2019-01-26T12:02:18.611400,Chester,Yes. A capitalized variable doesn't differ from a non-capitalized variable.
369,2019-01-26T12:02:22.611500,Ashley,"all-caps names are a good indicator to othhers that they are constants, and you should definitely do that"
369,2019-01-26T12:02:38.611800,Ashley,but what makes them ok is how they are meant to be used
369,2019-01-26T12:03:11.612800,Coleen,but if someone else takes my code and he doesn't know how this class is meant to be used?
369,2019-01-26T12:03:15.613000,Ashley,"for example, if I create this: `NY_TAX_RATE = 0.0725`, that's fine"
369,2019-01-26T12:03:33.613500,Ashley,that's why you make  them all caps
369,2019-01-26T12:03:45.614000,Ashley,because it tells other developers that they shouldn't change those things
369,2019-01-26T12:04:02.614700,Ashley,"similarly, python doesn't have private attributes"
369,2019-01-26T12:04:14.615200,Chester,"<@Coleen> to solve that particular problem, we write docstrings for classes, methods and functions. In these docstrings we show examples and explain how this class/method/function should be used"
369,2019-01-26T12:04:32.615700,Ashley,"but we try to tell other developers when we want them to treat an attribute as private by starting it with a `_`, e.g. `_super_secret_thing`"
369,2019-01-26T12:04:41.615900,Ashley,that too
369,2019-01-26T12:04:52.616200,Coleen,:slightly_smiling_face:
369,2019-01-26T12:05:10.616600,Ashley,the abstractions were written because you wanted your code to be easy to use
369,2019-01-26T12:05:50.617500,Ashley,"if people are finding it easier to use your ""private"" attributes than the other things meant for that, then you either didn't make something easy to use, or you didn't document it sufficiently enough"
369,2019-01-26T12:09:54.618700,Ashley,"on a related note, the bit about global objects that aren't constants being a code smell is what <@Chester> was saying regarding ""singleton behavior out of the box"". But that's why it's a code smell"
369,2019-01-26T12:14:07.619300,Coleen,I see
369,2019-01-26T12:16:20.619600,Coleen,Thanks guys!
369,2019-01-26T12:25:11.619800,Ashley,np!
370,2019-01-26T11:24:32.584300,Wendi,DO I have to know algorithms before learning python?
371,2019-01-26T12:33:01.621900,Janessa,"hello may i ask you guys something,  idid install windows and linux along each other but after i shut down linux and open my pc again to activate windows, windows get stucked or i can hear the sound of operating system opening but screen is black still and i have to force shut down again and again until it opens normally,,what may be the problem?"
371,2019-01-26T12:45:49.623600,Ashley,"<@Janessa> I'd guess it's either a corrupted install of windows, loose/janky video cable to the display, bad video driver (try rebooting a few times into safe mode to see if it consistently boots with no problems), or a bad GPU"
371,2019-01-26T12:48:10.624500,Janessa,<@Ashley> actually i had windows just installed linux along with it with partitions
371,2019-01-26T12:48:49.624800,Ashley,"yeah, it could still be something like a bad sector on yourr hard drive"
371,2019-01-26T12:49:19.625400,Ashley,IIRC the install disc for windows should have an analysis tool you can run to see if anything is messed up
371,2019-01-26T12:55:31.626000,Janessa,can i download this tool?
371,2019-01-26T12:58:53.626400,Ashley,"oh, no you just boot into the install media that you installed it from"
371,2019-01-26T12:59:00.626700,Ashley,like you wanted to reinstall it
371,2019-01-26T12:59:31.627200,Ashley,"it should be something like ""Installation repair/diagnostic"" or something"
371,2019-01-26T13:01:20.627600,Janessa,"aha ok, thnx"
371,2019-01-26T13:02:04.627800,Ashley,np
372,2019-01-26T14:02:12.629000,Coleen,"There was decorator for adding a function that is not a method to a class, what was it"
372,2019-01-26T14:03:10.629300,Hiroko,I think you might be thinking of monkey-patching
372,2019-01-26T14:03:21.629700,Sasha,`@staticmethod`?
372,2019-01-26T14:03:23.629800,Ashley,I wouldn't worry about that for now
372,2019-01-26T14:03:39.630300,Ashley,Try to keep the functions in a class related to the state of the object
372,2019-01-26T14:04:00.631100,Coleen,<@Thomasina> thats it
372,2019-01-26T14:04:02.631300,Ashley,"If they don't use `self`, then it probably doesn't need to be a function for that class"
373,2019-01-26T14:31:37.636000,Somer,"I like `@staticmethod` for db models for entity utility  functions. They don't use `self`, but produce instances that do. :upside_down_face: "
374,2019-01-26T14:57:46.637400,Coleen,is using **kwargs in function arguments considered evil?
374,2019-01-26T15:01:18.638500,Sasha,"Depends on how you use it. Passing arguments from a child class to a superclass, for instance, is pretty standard."
374,2019-01-26T15:01:39.638900,Coleen,"no, from one func to another"
374,2019-01-26T15:05:23.639800,Sasha,"Again, depends. Sometimes it's an elegant simplification, other times it's an obscure hack, heh heh."
374,2019-01-26T15:05:37.640100,Coleen,its just that the number of parameters is so large
374,2019-01-26T15:05:49.640500,Coleen,an if i change it in one function i need to change it in the other as well
374,2019-01-26T15:05:59.640800,Coleen,very error probe
374,2019-01-26T15:06:01.641000,Coleen,prone
374,2019-01-26T15:07:09.641800,Sasha,A large number of parameters that's common across functions is often a sign that you should be putting them together into a class that holds the parameter information.
374,2019-01-26T15:07:43.642100,Coleen,that's what i was worried about :smile:
374,2019-01-26T15:09:40.643100,Sasha,"Or possibly make a simple compound object that holds the parameters together, like a dataclass / named tuple."

375,2019-01-26T16:08:03.649600,Hiroko,Or use a template language

375,2019-01-26T16:10:01.652200,Jonas,:smile: but yeah like a couple of lines long is stretching it. you also run into alignment issues at the start
375,2019-01-26T16:10:20.652800,Jonas,and will have to dedent the first characters of each line. Looks horrible
375,2019-01-26T16:10:49.653200,Coleen,"I'm using

375,2019-01-26T16:14:16.663400,Hiroko,But what happens when you need to change it?
375,2019-01-26T16:14:26.664000,Coleen,I just edit the f-string
375,2019-01-26T16:14:31.664500,Hiroko,Or you hand it off to someone else to update it 
375,2019-01-26T16:14:57.666200,Hiroko,"Personally, I would not thank you for dumping that in my lap :grinning:"
375,2019-01-26T16:15:16.666900,Jonas,"look, you can use whatever tool you want for the job <@Coleen>. If you wanted to embed this whole f string in a perl script that's executed by a shell command, go for it"
375,2019-01-26T16:15:24.667200,Coleen,hahah
375,2019-01-26T16:15:27.667500,Jonas,but some tools are just not great.
375,2019-01-26T16:15:30.667700,Coleen,guys guys cmon
375,2019-01-26T16:15:44.668100,Jonas,f-strings are not great for writing a template in. You're duplicating lines everywhere
375,2019-01-26T16:15:49.668500,Jonas,break your lines up into a list
375,2019-01-26T16:15:56.668800,Jonas,"pass this list into a template, or a comprehension"
375,2019-01-26T16:16:17.669400,Jonas,then you won't have the issue you have *right now* where you need to go through 40+ lines of f-strings copy-pasting whatever alignment hack you come up with
375,2019-01-26T16:16:25.669600,Coleen,But then I don't see it nicely written all together
375,2019-01-26T16:17:13.670400,Coleen,"So say I use a template, because I still want to have it all written out like this"
375,2019-01-26T16:17:22.670700,Coleen,Where would be the gain
375,2019-01-26T16:17:33.671100,Coleen,No whitespaces at the begining?
375,2019-01-26T16:17:49.671400,Coleen,"Im not arguing, just want to understand"

375,2019-01-26T16:18:39.673100,Jonas,"right now, not much, because you've already sunk X time into doing it this way. The real gain would be personal, you can see the before and after, experience using the right tool for the job, and then you can personally compare the two solutions and come to your own understanding of what is better"
375,2019-01-26T16:18:48.673500,Jonas,"perhaps we are all wrong, but maybe, just perhaps not."
375,2019-01-26T16:19:08.674100,Coleen,im sure you're actually right
375,2019-01-26T16:19:09.674300,Jonas,"either way, the time we have spent discussing this, you could have done it"
375,2019-01-26T16:19:10.674400,Sasha,"For what it's worth, I'm on <@Coleen>’s side here. It's a pretty compact, obvious way to represent what he's trying to achieve. ""Explicit is better than implicit."""
375,2019-01-26T16:20:09.675100,Jonas,Using a template is just as explicit...?
375,2019-01-26T16:20:46.675800,Coleen,yes but introduces external dependency
375,2019-01-26T16:20:54.676000,Sasha,It is essentially a template. I'm not sure what's gained by pulling in a library to do the same thing a built-in feature handles.
375,2019-01-26T16:21:19.676300,Jonas,Would you make the same argument in a discussion about requests vs urllib?
375,2019-01-26T16:21:45.676500,Jonas,"If not, what's the difference here?"
375,2019-01-26T16:22:52.677400,Coleen,"""experimental python 3 support"", really?"
375,2019-01-26T16:23:37.678300,Jonas,"just playing devils advocate. A list comprehension is a hell of a lot better than jinja, and better than essentially an unrolled one."
375,2019-01-26T16:24:40.678900,Sasha,But don't you need to unroll everything anyway to set up the input to the comprehension? You're not going to get away with less than one line per line.
375,2019-01-26T16:25:18.679100,Jonas,"It's stable as hell in python 3, that section of the docs is really old. jinja 2.7 was released in *2013*"
375,2019-01-26T16:27:52.679400,Coleen,"ok, sounds good then :slightly_smiling_face:"
375,2019-01-26T16:28:09.679600,Coleen,anyway i need to learn it for some HTML stuff later on
375,2019-01-26T16:31:39.682100,Hiroko,"<@Sasha> two things I think would benefit bringing jinja or a template engine into this.  I can easily see the output needing to be changed, whether by <@Coleen> or someone else that takes over this code.  Using existing convention lowers the difficulty of someone else taking over.  In addition, chances are Andrei will come across a similar issue or one in which Jinja is being used, so _his_ rampup time for that would be drastically lessened by existing expertise"
375,2019-01-26T16:33:19.682900,Sasha,Fair enough. I just worry about the tendency to use a pneumatic hammer-drill just to hang a picture.  :wink:
375,2019-01-26T16:33:52.683800,Coleen,In all fairness I would have to use jinja later on for some HTML generation so that's a valid point.
375,2019-01-26T16:33:53.684000,Hiroko,"oh, for sure, and I do as well,  Its a balance, being pragmatic and thinking long term"
375,2019-01-26T16:35:27.685400,Hiroko,but I also feel a half hour or a half day’s effort to apply good practices when working on similar code saves myself alot of swearing at the idiot who did this piece of crap (and I was usually said idiot)
375,2019-01-26T16:35:29.685500,Jonas,this is the question I really want answering
375,2019-01-26T16:35:58.686100,Jonas,"""why use requests when we have urllib?"", isn't this the same argument?"
375,2019-01-26T16:38:48.687000,Sasha,It's similar. I personally wouldn't necessarily fault someone for using urllib if they didn't require more advanced functionality.
375,2019-01-26T16:49:42.687900,Coleen,"So how would I convert to jinja, wrap the whole thing in `Template`?"
376,2019-01-26T17:32:49.689300,Karoline,"I use urllib pretty often instead of requests.  if I'm not doing a ton it's often just as easy, and it makes it so I don't need another dependency"
376,2019-01-26T17:37:12.689500,Somer,"Totally agree. Less dependencies is nice. It is good to have the option of a framework, though. <@Karoline> :taco:"
377,2019-01-26T17:54:23.691000,Bridget,"Hi all,
question for you-
how does one extracts the value of ""Name"" (1) from this output, which according to Python, type = bytes (or str, depends on how you run the command that outputs this thing. btw don't know if it matters but it's the output of the docker-hub command.. which you can get the cli by installing it via pip):

377,2019-01-26T18:33:02.692000,Leonie,"<@Bridget> if you expect output to be *always* in the above form, then something like below will work:
```

384,2019-01-27T10:01:25.714700,Jody,Well.. to update a dictionary (if you know the key) you can write `mydict['mykey'] = 'value' `
384,2019-01-27T10:01:57.715300,Jody,"if you don’t, just add an `if` clause, something like `if 'blah' in mydict.keys(): do_something`"

Give each endpoint of the API it's own method for each request method they support (e.g. `get_user_info`/`set_user_info`). It should be a tool that you can easily use in your command line instead of postman. Also, use pytest and follow best practices for writing tests (let me know if you need tips/resources for this)"

384,2019-01-27T10:31:41.722000,Ashley,"to help make that happen, make sure any code that would change the state of your test subject is never in a test function/method, and is in a fixture"
384,2019-01-27T10:32:37.723000,Ashley,"make sure your fixtures do/return 1 thing, and are named appropriately. YOu don't want to have one fixture that does 7 steps for you. INstead, just make those steps individual fixtures that you can reuse several places"

394,2019-01-28T02:02:04.751000,Sasha,"That's what removing an item from a list does if you're iterating over it at the time... the `for` gets confused about which item it's on, since the one it was working on just disappeared, and everyone else scooted forward, so the 3rd item is now the 2nd, etc."
394,2019-01-28T02:02:24.751200,Demetrice,"I don't know if i'm thinking about it too literally, but wouldn't that depend on who it was that stepped out of line?"
394,2019-01-28T02:02:32.751400,Demetrice,"Okay, okay. I think i get that"
394,2019-01-28T02:02:56.751600,Sasha,"Very true. If someone at the back of the line left, it's no problem, since you haven't gotten there yet."
394,2019-01-28T02:04:45.751800,Demetrice,"So i don't fully understand it yet, and this is likely of no surprise to you. But implementing your suggestions caused the code to work"
394,2019-01-28T02:05:18.752000,Demetrice,I now have this. But now it's failing on the test for 3 1's. i'm getting 300 instead of a thousand. I'm thinking that might be due to me now working on a copy of the list instead of the original?

394,2019-01-28T02:07:53.752400,Sasha,"Yep. That's another problem. The `in` syntax doesn't work like that. You're asking ""is the list `[1, 1, 1]` an element of the list `rolls`""? And it isn't."
394,2019-01-28T02:08:07.752600,Sasha,What exactly are you trying to check there?
394,2019-01-28T02:09:10.752800,Demetrice,What i'm really trying to ask is does the list rolls contain 3 1's? And if it does add 1000 points to score
394,2019-01-28T02:09:27.753000,Demetrice,and remove the 3 1's so they can't be counted again for more points
394,2019-01-28T02:09:43.753200,Demetrice,It's a test case for the python koans i'm trying to work through
394,2019-01-28T02:10:04.753400,Demetrice,"# Greed is a dice game where you roll up to five dice to accumulate
# points.  The following ""score"" function will be used calculate the
# score of a single roll of the dice.
#
# A greed roll is scored as follows:
#
# * A set of three ones is 1000 points
#
# * A set of three numbers (other than ones) is worth 100 times the
#   number. (e.g. three fives is 500 points).
#
# * A one (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 100 points.
#
# * A five (that is not part of a set of three) is worth 50 points.
#
# * Everything else is worth 0 points.
#
#
# Examples:
#
# score([1,1,1,5,1]) =&gt; 1150 points
# score([2,3,4,6,2]) =&gt; 0 points
# score([3,4,5,3,3]) =&gt; 350 points
# score([1,5,1,2,4]) =&gt; 250 points

# Your goal is to write the score method."
394,2019-01-28T02:10:08.753600,Demetrice,This is what i'm trying to write
394,2019-01-28T02:10:39.753800,Sasha,"You'll need to do something more complicated for that logic, unfortunately."
394,2019-01-28T02:11:24.754000,Sasha,Have a look at `collections.Counter`.
394,2019-01-28T02:12:49.754200,Demetrice,I was concerned i might have been on the wrong track
394,2019-01-28T02:13:04.754400,Demetrice,It's a little past 1 am here and i have to be up sorta early tomorrow
394,2019-01-28T02:13:26.754600,Demetrice,You're saying i need to research what a collection counter is in python and it might help me solve this problem?
394,2019-01-28T02:14:52.754800,Sasha,"That's a particular library which is used to count how many things you have of different values. You don't need to use it, and in fact I'd encourage you to implement things from scratch if this is a learning exercise, but it would be a fast way to implement this logic."
394,2019-01-28T02:17:59.755200,Demetrice,Yeah it's supposed to be for learning so i think ideally i'm supposed to struggle this much. I looked it up and i thought the if  test_values in list:
394,2019-01-28T02:18:14.755400,Demetrice,"Format would work, but i'm disappointed it's not having the desired result"
394,2019-01-28T02:19:11.755600,Sasha,"You can do `if 1 in [1, 2, 3]`, but lists only check for one matching element, not groups of them."
394,2019-01-28T02:19:58.755800,Demetrice,So then maybe i need to iterate before the if statement to get the desired result
394,2019-01-28T02:20:04.756000,Demetrice,This is gonna be really round about but it might work
394,2019-01-28T02:21:05.756200,Sasha,My advice would be to maybe think in terms of a useful data structure.
394,2019-01-28T02:26:44.756400,Demetrice,I'm not sure what you mean by that
394,2019-01-28T02:26:55.756600,Demetrice,I tried to do it this way. It's really really dirty but it also ended up not working

394,2019-01-28T02:27:16.757000,Demetrice,Now i'm getting an error message about  TypeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object is not subscriptable
394,2019-01-28T02:27:22.757200,Demetrice,I think i did something i shouldn't have
394,2019-01-28T02:28:52.757400,Sasha,It's the `remove` call using brackets.
394,2019-01-28T02:31:16.757600,Sasha,So this is a decent step. It's obviously useful to have a count value for how many 1's you have. Would it be useful to have count values for every dice value?
394,2019-01-28T02:31:21.757800,Demetrice,Right it was supposed to be parenthesis
394,2019-01-28T02:31:50.758000,Demetrice,Yes it would. So i think i'm nearing the end of this
394,2019-01-28T02:31:54.758200,Demetrice,My code is going to be really ugly
394,2019-01-28T02:32:03.758400,Demetrice,But i was able to pass the test for the 3 1's
394,2019-01-28T02:32:21.758600,Demetrice,But you're right it's not going to work for everything else. So i need to copy that format and use it for all the other ones
394,2019-01-28T02:32:40.758800,Demetrice,But it's going to be really ugly and inefficient. For tonight i suppose i'll just focus on making it pass
394,2019-01-28T02:33:05.759000,Sasha,"If you find yourself duplicating code, there's probably a way to combine them."
394,2019-01-28T02:33:57.759200,Sasha,"The time you spend writing code you know to be crappy is probably better spent thinking of a good way to do it. It's learning, after all."
394,2019-01-28T02:34:10.759400,Sasha,You don't want to teach yourself bad habits.
394,2019-01-28T02:35:52.759600,Demetrice,Hmm
394,2019-01-28T02:35:59.759800,Demetrice,Good point
394,2019-01-28T02:36:22.760000,Demetrice,Well now i know one way it can work. But i guess fully writing it wouldn't be best
394,2019-01-28T02:36:23.760200,Demetrice,Hmm

402,2019-01-28T11:35:03.786700,Sasha,"<@Benton> The `""a""` means you're opening an existing file for append. Does it exist? You also seem to be mixing forward and backward slashes... better practice is to use `os.path.join` to be OS-independent."

403,2019-01-28T11:41:14.796600,Hiroko,its also good practice to avoid spaces in file names

403,2019-01-28T11:43:53.799700,Benton,"<@Hiroko> there is no spaces in my folder, ""I did not like this store"" is the text that appear in the row of the dataframe, which is also the 12th row that didn't manage to get written successfully"

For the latter, something like this:

    last_marker='to here'
    with open('filename', 'r') as file_with_important_stuff:
        for looking_for_marker in file_with_important_stuff:

407,2019-01-28T12:27:13.815600,Carrol,I’m not familiar with Paramiko but I think what you’re doing is sending raw data to the socket instead of getting a pty to send data to. The docs for `invoke_shell` imply you’d need to ask for a pty first: <http://docs.paramiko.org/en/2.4/api/channel.html#paramiko.channel.Channel.invoke_shell>
407,2019-01-28T12:31:30.815800,Carrol,You might want to look at Fabric which probably has a friendlier API than Paramiko (which it uses for the SSH operations) <https://www.fabfile.org>

411,2019-01-28T15:44:55.837300,Lamont,"Hi all! I’m new here so if this isn’t the place to ask something like this, please let me know!

I am working on a problem from <http://CodeWars.com|CodeWars.com> and my algorithm implementation is not fast enough. Would anyone here mind looking through my implementation and suggesting improvements? Codes ~40 lines"
411,2019-01-28T15:48:47.838600,Lamont,"Here’s the prompt:

”
Given a positive number n &gt; 1 find the prime factor decomposition of n. The result will be a string with the following form :

 “(p1**n1)(p2**n2)...(pk**nk)”
with the p(i) in increasing order and n(i) empty if n(i) is 1.

Example: n = 86240 should return “(2**5)(5)(7**2)(11)”
”"
411,2019-01-28T15:50:38.838900,Lamont,"My workflow is to find the primes (starting with primes smaller than 50) and dividing the provided  number, n, by primes, recording the number of times n is divided by each prime. I then use these recorded numbers in the return"
411,2019-01-28T15:53:56.840900,Lamont,"My current thinking is that, while it passes the provided test case, it may be stalling during the while loop “while n &gt; 1:“, for an edge case, such as when n is divided multiple consecutive times by a single prime, in the while loop “while n % prime == 0:”"
411,2019-01-28T15:57:01.842200,Raven,"If you're not sure if it's stalling or not, one first step would be to find out. You could consider adding something like `print(n)` inside the loop. (Not sure if printing works on CodeWars, but if not, that's a good reason to try the code on your own machine, perhaps)"
411,2019-01-28T15:59:04.843800,Lamont,"Thanks <@Raven>, I’ll give that a go. I’m also pretty sure that large while loop “while N &gt; 1:” has the greatest time complexity out of my whole algo, so I’m going to try to condense it and see if that helps"
411,2019-01-28T16:00:49.844300,Raven,Minor code clarity hint - you don't need an `if` outside a `while` with the same condition
411,2019-01-28T16:02:54.846800,Raven,"It's also not clear why you would regenerate the primes list, since most of the contents aren't going to change between calls. If you really do need to expand the list as you go along, just calculate from the end onwards"
411,2019-01-28T16:03:18.847100,Lamont,"Yeah, I debated putting that “if” statement there but decided on including it, in order to make it easy to break out of the for-loop after n is divided by the given prime number the maximum number of times. This was an attempt to let the algo break out of the for-loop after factoring that prime number out of n"
411,2019-01-28T16:03:49.847600,Lamont,I could do that by converting getPrimes into a generator
411,2019-01-28T16:05:07.848600,Raven,"Ah, I see. I guess it's times like this I wish Python had a do..while loop."
411,2019-01-28T16:10:42.849800,Raven,"Without wanting to disturb things too much, you might also consider a recursive approach, starting with the largest prime smaller than `n` and working downwards until you find an integer factor, and then you can repeat the process for each of those, etc"
411,2019-01-28T16:12:23.850400,Lamont,"I was just thinking something along the lines, working from larger to smaller prime factors. Great idea — I’ll give it a shot now!"
411,2019-01-28T16:53:11.853300,Lamont,"Turns out the solution is to just iterate i from 1 to n, checking if n is divisible by i. If it is, include it in the answer. Any non-prime i will be disregarded as it is a multiple of a smaller prime, of which n is not divisible"
411,2019-01-28T17:35:23.855900,Sasha,Although you can terminate at sqrt(n). Anything larger must be prime.
412,2019-01-28T17:43:04.856600,Carmen,"Optimization: You can iterate over odds greater than 2, since 2 is the only positive even number that's also a prime."
412,2019-01-28T17:46:39.859600,Carmen,"Pro-tip: Read the code if it's available, don't just comment on text descriptions of solutions. Then you don't look like a dunce like me when the optimization you mention was already there."
412,2019-01-28T17:47:02.860000,Lamont,"Yep, getPrimes() stops at n**0.5+1 and returns only primes, removing any evens"

420,2019-01-29T03:44:49.913100,Conchita,I'm not familiar with how to do that <@Jimmy> Is there a library I should use?
420,2019-01-29T03:45:20.913700,Valeri,<@Conchita> You'll have to create a Slack app probably
420,2019-01-29T03:45:24.913900,Jimmy,"you can but that's not really necessary, let me look it up"
420,2019-01-29T03:45:40.914200,Valeri,yeah
420,2019-01-29T03:45:44.914400,Jimmy,<https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks>
420,2019-01-29T03:45:48.914700,Jimmy,no you don't need an app
420,2019-01-29T03:46:05.915100,Jimmy,haha yes you do sorry. That's the first point :smile:
420,2019-01-29T03:46:06.915300,Jimmy,my bad
420,2019-01-29T03:46:43.915600,Conchita,"Great, reading now"
420,2019-01-29T03:46:58.915800,Jimmy,<https://github.com/slackapi/python-slackclient>
420,2019-01-29T03:47:12.916300,Jimmy,you can probably use that as library :point_up:
420,2019-01-29T03:47:27.916700,Jimmy,but it's just an http request so you don't really have to
420,2019-01-29T03:52:46.917000,Valeri,Clients are always better tho
420,2019-01-29T03:53:00.917500,Valeri,You won't need to handle network errors yourself
420,2019-01-29T03:53:27.917700,Valeri,at least
420,2019-01-29T03:53:58.918200,Jimmy,"true, but something like requests would be enough"
420,2019-01-29T03:54:10.918600,Jimmy,"I doubt the slack client does much more,"
420,2019-01-29T03:54:28.919100,Jimmy,probably a bit of formatting since the API is not consistent in that regards
420,2019-01-29T03:55:08.919200,Conchita,"Would something like this work? This is after I have created a slack app, enabled webhooks and generated my webhook address (which I masked in my example)"
420,2019-01-29T03:55:37.920300,Jimmy,I don't think the payload should be like that
420,2019-01-29T03:55:40.920400,Conchita,"Or I mean, I know this isn't working - I received `invalid output`. I mean is it something close to this I neeed to do?"
420,2019-01-29T03:56:00.920700,Jimmy,"```
payload = {
    ""text"": ""Hello, world.""
}
```"
420,2019-01-29T03:56:02.920900,Jimmy,try that
420,2019-01-29T03:57:22.921600,Conchita,"That outputs a lenghty html file that starts like this ```&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=""en-US""&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;script&gt;
window.ts_endpoint_url = ""https:\/\/slack.com\/beacon\/timing"";

(function(e) { ..............```"
420,2019-01-29T03:57:35.921900,Conchita,And no msg is posted in slack
420,2019-01-29T04:00:33.922400,Jimmy,hmm I can't enable incoming webhook on <@Leana> to test it :confused:
420,2019-01-29T04:01:07.922900,Jimmy,"try with `<http://requests.post|requests.post>(""urll"", json=payload)`"
420,2019-01-29T04:01:58.923300,Conchita,Boom! That worked <@Jimmy>
420,2019-01-29T04:02:12.923700,Conchita,Have a hot :taco: <@Jimmy> Thank you
420,2019-01-29T04:02:19.923800,Leana,None
420,2019-01-29T04:03:01.924600,Jimmy,so by putting `json` you tell request that your payload is json and it encodes it for you and set the content-type header to json
420,2019-01-29T04:03:20.925100,Jimmy,without that data is sent in another format and slack wants it in json
420,2019-01-29T04:10:47.925400,Conchita,Got it!
420,2019-01-29T05:45:48.932800,Alicia,"<@Jimmy> the advantages of using conda are (IMO):
• that is easy to use
• it has already been spread across the company I work in
• A good dependency mgmt (but not as good as pipenv or poetry ones)
• It automatically downloads the python version you ask for your env

Why I want it to download only from pypi?
• Because sometimes it messes up with packages for strange reasons
• It seems to use custom builds for packages for different versions of python
• Custom builds “are not exportable” as requirement file since they are custom (but they are exportable as a conda-like requirements file)"
420,2019-01-29T05:48:26.933500,Jonas,The cons in that list clearly outweigh the pros
420,2019-01-29T05:57:48.935400,Valeri,<@Alicia> <https://stackoverflow.com/a/52132667/6403406>
420,2019-01-29T05:58:03.935700,Valeri,might help
420,2019-01-29T06:02:05.936600,Renna,this problem is driving me insane - given a arbitrary string - return a list of valid json strings/ objects. Is there any way to do this easily without regex and recursion? <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21994677/find-json-strings-in-a-string>
420,2019-01-29T06:02:22.937100,Renna,I dont want to implement some kind of lexical parser...
420,2019-01-29T06:03:54.937500,Valeri,Can you show us your i/p?
420,2019-01-29T06:04:08.937700,Renna,me?
420,2019-01-29T06:05:14.937900,Chuck,"yes, what does your actual input string look like"
420,2019-01-29T06:05:41.938100,Valeri,yes
420,2019-01-29T06:07:00.938700,Renna,<https://pastebin.com/ukJxhAAW>
420,2019-01-29T06:07:20.939000,Renna,i can parse it but i was hoping for a more generic solution
420,2019-01-29T06:07:33.939200,Renna,it has two json strings embedded in a string
420,2019-01-29T06:08:14.939400,Renna,maybe parser like this might be able to scan and select all valid json trees <https://pythonhosted.org/pyrser/tutorial1.html>
420,2019-01-29T06:08:37.939600,Renna,which might be the more general solution
420,2019-01-29T06:10:05.940200,Valeri,And you need a solution using python or php?
420,2019-01-29T06:11:34.940400,Renna,well atm i am using python
420,2019-01-29T06:11:56.940600,Alicia,didn’t worked :confused:
420,2019-01-29T06:14:14.940800,Renna,i need to do a bit more reading i guess if i want a generalized solution <https://tomassetti.me/parsing-in-python/>
420,2019-01-29T06:16:44.941100,Valeri,Your use case is pretty straightforward imo
420,2019-01-29T06:17:17.941300,Valeri,You just have to pickup stuff between `{}` and form a dict right?
420,2019-01-29T06:18:01.941500,Valeri,To convert a string back to json you have `json.loads()`
420,2019-01-29T06:18:21.941800,Valeri,<@Renna>
420,2019-01-29T06:18:53.942000,Valeri,"So, what exactly are you trying to achieve?"
420,2019-01-29T06:19:10.942200,Valeri,And tell us more about your use case?
420,2019-01-29T06:20:08.942400,Renna,yea correct - well there are actually two json strings
420,2019-01-29T06:20:22.942600,Renna,one at the very end saying total rows returned
420,2019-01-29T06:20:59.942800,Renna,I think i might make a handcrafted solution for now but i might make a more general solution as a side project - it should be possible
420,2019-01-29T06:27:54.943000,Valeri,Sure
420,2019-01-29T06:28:12.943200,Valeri,I can already think of a two-pointers based solution
420,2019-01-29T06:28:41.943400,Valeri,Lemme know if you'd like to do it as a side project. I'd contribute <@Renna>
420,2019-01-29T06:55:33.945700,Valeri,For your use case yes
421,2019-01-29T05:33:53.926800,Alicia,"Hi guys,
I have a question but I couldn’t find any answer elsewhere…
There’s a way to force conda to download packages only from pypi?"
421,2019-01-29T05:37:59.927300,Jimmy,I'm not familliar with conda but is there any advantages using it if you only download stuff from pypi ?
422,2019-01-29T06:41:23.944100,Arturo,"is this proper pep 8 standards? Bare in mind this has come out of a function;
```
    not_present_script = inter_freq_internal_freq['Script'].loc[~(
            inter_freq_internal_freq['eNodeBName'].isin(
                    sites_file['*eNodeB Name']))]
```"
422,2019-01-29T06:50:30.944400,Renna,yea might be easier to look for opening and closing { and keep a stack or something - then checking the string is valid json using the json libary. I will try this first at least
422,2019-01-29T06:50:42.944800,Renna,maybe parser is over kill
422,2019-01-29T06:51:39.945300,Leida,not to sure about pep8 but this isnt readable.. as in it has got bigger problems than pep8..
422,2019-01-29T07:04:13.946000,Leida,<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation>
422,2019-01-29T07:05:03.946400,Leida,"```not_present_script = inter_freq_internal_freq['Script'].loc[
    ~(inter_freq_internal_freq['eNodeBName'].isin(sites_file['*eNodeB Name']))]```"
422,2019-01-29T07:05:38.947100,Leida,i would break from there but the `~(inter_freq_internal_freq['eNodeBName'].isin(sites_file['*eNodeB Name']))` is way long and is pretty much a separate thing
422,2019-01-29T07:05:54.947700,Leida,so i would assign that to a variable and then use that in the outer bit
422,2019-01-29T07:06:49.948400,Leida,"```dat_thing = ~(inter_freq_internal_freq['eNodeBName'].isin(sites_file['*eNodeB Name']))
not_present_script = inter_freq_internal_freq['Script'].loc[dat_thing]```"
422,2019-01-29T07:08:08.949400,Leida,and then break up that thing into something more understandable as well
422,2019-01-29T07:08:24.949800,Leida,"idk, maybe this makes perfect sense in pandas world xD"
422,2019-01-29T07:10:47.951200,Leida,"my understanding is that a single line of code should do a single thing, this long line that you posted does like 3 nested lookups. I feel it would be simpler to follow if they were separate lines"
423,2019-01-29T07:15:44.952400,Coleen,"Hi guys, I need some regex magic to extract the fraction from a string of the form `'123abc456/789' -&gt; ('123abc', 456/789)`"

423,2019-01-29T07:50:02.956600,Jonas,<https://regex101.com/> is really helpful for this kind of thing
423,2019-01-29T07:50:47.958200,Jonas,it's great to visualise the matches

423,2019-01-29T07:55:37.958500,Conchita,"I'm not sure how to explain this, but here's me trying; I have built an application that connects to Twitter's API and streams tweets which my application then analyses for sentiment. This is a continuous stream. Tweet volume, sentiment results and such are written to a db each minute. It works - until it doesn't.

What happens after a few hours is that the tool continues to write data to my db, but all of the entries have values at 0 (See the image).

I assume what happens is that Twitter shuts off my connection, but they way I have coded this, my app continues to run. I'm unsure how to fix this however. My best guess is that I haven't setup my exception handling correctly."
423,2019-01-29T07:58:54.959300,Conchita,"To the more experienced people on here, can you smell where the issue might be? This is a snippet of my try/except"
423,2019-01-29T07:59:48.959700,Jimmy,do you have any logging output ?
423,2019-01-29T08:00:41.960900,Conchita,"Only whats inside the `try` block, when the initial connection to Twitter happens"

423,2019-01-29T08:01:19.961900,Conchita,It does not <@Leida>
423,2019-01-29T08:01:39.962700,Conchita,Should I add a `continue` in the end of my `except` blocks?
423,2019-01-29T08:01:54.963200,Leida,you have some exception that falls through the current catching
423,2019-01-29T08:02:05.963600,Conchita,Or am I not catching the errors
423,2019-01-29T08:02:13.963900,Conchita,Yeah that could be
423,2019-01-29T08:02:26.964300,Conchita,"How can I catch all, for the purpose of finding it?"
423,2019-01-29T08:05:01.966500,Conchita,Would this work?
423,2019-01-29T08:05:15.966900,Leida,that would do it
423,2019-01-29T08:05:23.967200,Leida,only your while loop keeps on going
423,2019-01-29T08:07:21.968100,Leida,stream.disconnect() disconnects but does stream.filter() connect?
423,2019-01-29T08:08:53.968900,Conchita,"I'm pretty sure it does, but can't be 100% due to lack of proper logging in the past"
423,2019-01-29T08:10:06.969700,Leida,what triggers your db write tho?
423,2019-01-29T08:11:22.971700,Leida,"an uncaught exception would break the while loop and that bit of code stops, if you have some external db write that does the write without regard to whether it has data or not could explain the 0's"
423,2019-01-29T08:13:32.973500,Conchita,"I know this is not best practice but the logic is as follow; I use global variables.
1) These are updated as data is processed
2)  Then a while loop read those globals and writes to the db
3) globals are reset
4) while loop sleeps for x seconds
5) repeat"
423,2019-01-29T08:15:16.974000,Conchita,None
423,2019-01-29T08:17:11.975600,Leida,and you have some threading so that you can have two blocking while loops going?
423,2019-01-29T08:17:59.976500,Conchita,"Well, no"
423,2019-01-29T08:19:23.978400,Conchita,I sort of started writing this app two weeks after I starting my programming journey
423,2019-01-29T08:19:44.979000,Leida,anyway the main point is that an uncaught exception jumps out of your reading while loop and no new data goes into your globals
423,2019-01-29T08:19:52.979300,Conchita,Full of bad practice and not knowing exactly what I'm doing
423,2019-01-29T08:19:59.979700,Conchita,Exactly
423,2019-01-29T08:21:05.980600,Leida,catch the exception that does this and fix the problem
423,2019-01-29T08:21:26.981300,Conchita,On it
423,2019-01-29T08:21:41.981900,Leida,"try not to keep a catch-all in your code, would add to the list of bad ideas ^^"
423,2019-01-29T08:22:44.983200,Conchita,"Absolutely, only using it now for testing so I can find the ninja exception so I can add it to the small list of specific exceptions"
423,2019-01-29T08:23:01.983600,Conchita,Could you shed some light on threading and why not having it is a bad idea when using two while loops?
423,2019-01-29T08:23:34.984300,Leida,"threading is not a good idea for you right now, so not having it is good :smile:"
423,2019-01-29T08:24:13.985100,Leida,"i just cant tell how you can have two blocking while loops going, unless they are nested ^^"
423,2019-01-29T08:26:13.986500,Conchita,One while loop is inside a function. The second is not. If that answers your Q
423,2019-01-29T08:27:34.986600,Conchita,None
423,2019-01-29T08:29:21.987600,Leida,now im confused how it enters any data besides the first time atall :smile:
423,2019-01-29T08:29:29.987800,Alicia,"`There's a way to force conda to download packages only from pypi?`

this was the question maybe you missed it out"
423,2019-01-29T08:29:57.988600,Leida,"you run the script, definitions are loaded and then the code hits if __name__ line which calls main()"
423,2019-01-29T08:30:23.989200,Leida,the main contains an endless loop that wont stop unless some error that you are not catching break it
423,2019-01-29T08:30:38.989600,Leida,and only then should the writing to database loop start
423,2019-01-29T08:31:46.990900,Leida,in the while run: bit do you call main() again somewhere?
423,2019-01-29T08:32:11.991100,Conchita,No
423,2019-01-29T08:33:00.991400,Conchita,That while loop that starts off at line 32 runs every 60 second
423,2019-01-29T08:34:45.992700,Conchita,"Since the variable `run` is always True, and to the best of my knowledge can't turn False: the while loop will never stop. And in the first line of the while loop it has a sleep statement"
423,2019-01-29T08:35:10.993100,Conchita,That sleep statement has a variable which is set to 60 seconds
423,2019-01-29T08:36:25.994000,Conchita,Does that make sense or am I missing some core concepts here?
423,2019-01-29T08:36:27.994100,Leida,"the sleep() blocks the thread, this should not enable the other loop to run any further"
423,2019-01-29T08:37:06.994900,Conchita,"interesting. Well it does run for quite some time. Sometimes days, sometimes hours"
423,2019-01-29T08:37:56.995900,Conchita,hmmm
423,2019-01-29T08:37:58.996000,Leida,"my initial guess was that your second loop calls main again and that an error that causes it to stop would enable a write to the database, but i dont see that anywhere"
423,2019-01-29T08:38:07.996300,Leida,do you call the script itself in a loop somewhere?
423,2019-01-29T08:39:00.996600,Conchita,I do not
423,2019-01-29T08:39:59.997500,Conchita,"The last loop in this script is a for loop which is  inside of a class I have, but that deals with sentiment analysis (textblob) and does not call this script"
423,2019-01-29T08:41:17.997700,Valeri,Yeah I got that
423,2019-01-29T08:41:27.997900,Valeri,I was wondering what lead you into doing this
423,2019-01-29T08:41:54.998400,Valeri,Maybe if you shared that we could have a better simpler solution?
423,2019-01-29T08:41:56.998600,Leida,did the last paste of code contain code from multiple sources?
423,2019-01-29T08:43:35.998800,Conchita,No
423,2019-01-29T08:43:46.999100,Conchita,All the snippets have been from the same script
423,2019-01-29T08:48:49.001200,Leida,there is some magic going on that i dont see from the pastes but basically in the `start_stream()` there is an uncaught exception so that the while loop breaks and the global state does not get updated. Since there is a break statement in the successful running of `stream.filter()` means that something needs to call this bit of code over and over
423,2019-01-29T08:49:06.001700,Leida,what ever the exception is calling `stream.filter()` does not fix it
423,2019-01-29T08:49:23.002100,Leida,so i would assume the problem is with the authentication becoming invalid
423,2019-01-29T08:53:23.004700,Valeri,<@Conchita> Why don't you allow your code to break and then figure out what went wrong?
423,2019-01-29T08:54:09.005500,Valeri,Basically get rid of all the exceptions and see why your code broke
423,2019-01-29T08:54:41.006500,Valeri,"Also, relying on a exceptions to perform tasks is a bad idea imo"
423,2019-01-29T08:55:28.007600,Leida,there is mention of async in the code so that some part may well die while the rest keeps on running
423,2019-01-29T08:56:27.008100,Valeri,Yeah
423,2019-01-29T08:57:11.009200,Valeri,"Also, why don't you verify your data before writing to the database?"
423,2019-01-29T08:57:33.009900,Valeri,As in they're non-zero entries
423,2019-01-29T08:57:47.010100,Hiroko,<http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.4.0/streaming_how_to.html#a-few-more-pointers>
423,2019-01-29T08:57:59.010500,Hiroko,suggests you’re using the wrong kwarg for streaming
423,2019-01-29T08:58:16.011000,Hiroko,"you have `is_async`,  the filter takes in an `async` kwarg"
423,2019-01-29T09:04:40.011500,Leida,"the documentation may be wrong tho, github on master has `is_async`"
423,2019-01-29T09:07:26.012000,Leida,or the package is installed straight from git
423,2019-01-29T09:08:49.012600,Leida,or just wrong version :smile:
423,2019-01-29T09:08:52.012900,Valeri,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
423,2019-01-29T09:09:07.013200,Leida,3.4 does indeed have `async` 3.6 has `is_async`
423,2019-01-29T09:12:21.013300,Arturo,cool thanks!
423,2019-01-29T09:17:28.015100,Leida,ok so actually there is no exception to catch in `start_stream()` since it probably succeeds first time it is run and since `is_async` is `True` the `stream.filter()` is run on a separate thread
423,2019-01-29T09:19:08.016600,Leida,the library handles passing of data between threads internally
423,2019-01-29T09:20:18.017700,Leida,so now i guess the stream is terminated at some point or just blocked from getting any data and there is no exception to catch on the main thread
423,2019-01-29T09:23:14.018700,Leida,if this is so then the pasted lines of logging would correspond to times of restarting the script
423,2019-01-29T09:26:56.020100,Leida,so... the error should show up in `stream.listner` by the looks of the tweepy source code
424,2019-01-29T08:00:52.961100,Leida,does it spam it?
425,2019-01-29T08:55:17.007500,Valeri,You're probably just being rate limited maybe?
426,2019-01-29T09:08:09.012200,Hiroko,:facepalm:
427,2019-01-29T09:08:16.012300,Karoline,"hey someone else might have mentioned this (I'm just scrolling through) but there is `logging.exception` which will automatically print the stack trace for you. So you can do something like:

```
except Exception:

429,2019-01-29T11:36:09.033100,Nenita,So a long while back i posted a challenge i was facing which was running queries on a remote pc when the odbc driver doesn't allow it. I did a ton of research on ssh and figured out that you really can't run executables/batch files over ssh.
429,2019-01-29T11:36:57.033800,Nenita,at least for windows. seems like linux users were able to get it going
429,2019-01-29T11:47:02.043100,Clemmie,"<@Nenita> that sounds unusual, can you point to resources explaining why? I didn’t think there would be a situation where an OS would differentiate between an “local” user and an ssh-ed user. Ultimately, at least in *nix they both login to the shell"
429,2019-01-29T11:49:12.046500,Nenita,"I can try. but i said that earlier because of testing. i got it working with putty, vm linux, as well as python, but when a script was run say - 'start .' it will execute the command, but nothing happens on either pc, mine or the remote pc."
429,2019-01-29T11:49:35.046900,Nenita,but let me see if i can find solid sources from my findings
429,2019-01-29T11:51:10.047700,Nenita,"but also when running any script with 'start' at the beginning, putty just hangs"
429,2019-01-29T11:51:18.048100,Nenita,for how long? - don't know. seems forever.
429,2019-01-29T11:52:27.049200,Leida,"i've got an architecture problem to solve:
I async in udp packets and relay them to a consumer elsewhere. From the packet i need to update internal state to mirror the packet sender to build logic on top of the sender. Since the packets are UDP i cant use streams and have to go lower and implement a protocol. The loop.create_datagram_endpoint() takes a protocol factory. This means i cant hook it up with a connection to the state at init and have to find another method to pass the data.
Some of my ideas:
Create a protocol factory factory that creates the state sharing at init. Seems bit dumb.
Create a singleton via an internal state module that has a data sink method for the protocol to use and internal data parsing and what not and another public api for getting the current state. This could do the trick, but singleton...
Another idea was to try use rxpy as im familiar with rx on .NET. Havent figured out how to implement it asyncronously and not even sure it needs to be async and which version of the library to use...
Another dumb idea is to biggyback on the logging module and do the state mutation via that. Logging internally implements pub sub so it would work but at the cost of being clever with in built libraries that werent meant for that specific task.
One more idea is to be a good boy and get state out of the code as the functional way and instead write it to a data storage unit like sqlite or w/e and then create a second program to check the state and execute logic based on that. Since nothing needs to be done in the same second there is no timing constraints. A con is the data read and writes - i would rather have everything on ram. Some ram based database then?
Another idea is to make the protocol itself keep the state using what-are-they-called.. class variables? But holding the whole state in something that is a protocol for something else does just not feel right xD"
429,2019-01-29T11:56:55.051500,Leida,i was thinking the same but decided against it as the introduction of the channel mentioned trying not to post stuff that help could deal with
429,2019-01-29T11:58:42.052200,Leida,ill ask there later i guess ^^
429,2019-01-29T12:02:36.052300,Carmen,"Okay, so your biggest issue will be carrying over that data between requests. The best way is to just pass around the prediction model ID and always pull the full data from the database when you need it. If they need to modify things, present those fields to the user and use a fields whitelist for processing the update."
429,2019-01-29T12:05:15.052600,Janella,"I will definitely need to do more research into Django, I'm pretty new to it. Thanks for your help, this is a good guide on where to look next!"

432,2019-01-29T12:57:26.058300,Cherilyn,Hello all. I have a newbie issue but I couldnt solve it. <https://www.reddit.com/r/djangolearning/comments/al2mvq/cannot_create_a_new_instance_to_model/>?
432,2019-01-29T12:59:49.059400,Clemmie,Can you show the code for your `project_list` view?
432,2019-01-29T13:00:27.060400,Jonas,<@Cherilyn>: is the model in the database?
432,2019-01-29T13:00:40.061100,Jonas,"you need to break down your problem. Is the problem that the model is not saved, or that the model is not displayed."
432,2019-01-29T13:01:06.061600,Carmen,"<@Nenita> Your main issue is that up until the past few years, Windows didn't really care about SSH, so it was all ad-hoc from third-party projects.

432,2019-01-29T13:01:39.062600,Carmen,"That will get you an SSH shell, and then you just run your commands as per usual (with the obvious caveat that you aren't going to have your normal Linux command-line toolkit available)."
432,2019-01-29T13:01:52.062900,Hiroko,interesting.  thanks!
432,2019-01-29T13:02:15.063100,Jonas,"So the issue is not that you cannot create them, the issue is you cannot display them"
432,2019-01-29T13:02:26.063400,Jonas,"so you need to update your question accordingly, and show different code?"
432,2019-01-29T13:03:22.063700,Nenita,can this be done without putty?
432,2019-01-29T13:03:27.063900,Jonas,"Just a tip, when you're asking a question online you need to make it as specific as possible. Something like ""models dont appear"" is too vague - there are lots of reasons why this could happen. You need to dig into *why* they don't appear, and ask more specific questions. Like, ""why is this model not being displayed even though it is in the database"""
432,2019-01-29T13:04:11.064500,Nenita,nvm
432,2019-01-29T13:04:33.065000,Nenita,"just tried it. it works, but the same issue is still occuring. it just hangs when certain commands are run"
432,2019-01-29T13:05:52.065100,Cherilyn,"actually, the form that I am using the create new instances cannot do the job. I can only create instance via admin panel. Whenever I try to create new new projects via form, it does nothing and redirect me to project list page"
432,2019-01-29T13:06:32.065800,Nenita,"and for the commands that don't hang, i.e. opening a bat file - nothing happens still. odd."
432,2019-01-29T13:07:08.066000,Jonas,"Ok, so ones created through the admin are displayed in the list?"

432,2019-01-29T13:08:24.067800,Cherilyn,It seems that form can not create new instances
432,2019-01-29T13:08:52.068000,Jonas,`form.save()` returns the instance of the model it is saving
432,2019-01-29T13:09:05.068200,Jonas,try inspecting the return value to see if it has an `.id`
432,2019-01-29T13:29:08.068400,Cherilyn,maybe it is a stupid question but how can I inspect return value?
432,2019-01-29T13:47:33.071700,Jonas,`print()` is the simplest :slightly_smiling_face:

432,2019-01-29T14:19:45.087600,Nenita,I have tried windows SSH and putty and both output the same result
432,2019-01-29T14:20:26.088600,Mozelle,I thought json.loads treated it like a list so you could use the fields?
432,2019-01-29T14:20:34.089000,Raven,"<@Nenita> SSH just executes commands as if they are being executed locally - it doesn't matter which SSH program you use, generally"
432,2019-01-29T14:20:44.089600,Carmen,Aha. I must have picked up the Ubuntu thing from somewhere else.
432,2019-01-29T14:21:00.090500,Carmen,Are the commands you're trying to run GUI-based?
432,2019-01-29T14:21:11.091200,Nenita,putty creates a log file for me so I was able to confirm that packages were sent and received
432,2019-01-29T14:21:30.091900,Nenita,but it just hangs at receiving packets - per what the log showed
432,2019-01-29T14:21:41.092400,Jonas,<@Mozelle> it's not telling you the field doesn't exist
432,2019-01-29T14:21:50.093100,Jonas,it's telling you the variable `items` doesn't exist
432,2019-01-29T14:21:58.093600,Jonas,just as if you do `foo + blah`
432,2019-01-29T14:22:01.093900,Jonas,you'd get the same error.
432,2019-01-29T14:22:36.096400,Nenita,<@Carmen> no just basic commands like 'start'
432,2019-01-29T14:22:47.097000,Magdalena,Anyone else using VSCode ever have an issue where it will sometimes not pause execution at breakpoints you’ve set?
432,2019-01-29T14:23:32.098300,Mozelle,This is the output it has would items not be a field?
432,2019-01-29T14:23:37.098700,Nenita,basic commands that return data work perfectly like their suppose to. It just hangs with certain commands.
432,2019-01-29T14:23:59.099500,Cherish,"<@Nenita> one thing I did learn the hard way, SSH’ing into a Linux environment though (not Windows), is that this didn’t work to run commands that are aliases in the bash profile on the other machine"
432,2019-01-29T14:24:13.100000,Cherish,not sure if that might be what you’re running into
432,2019-01-29T14:24:27.100400,Carmen,"<@Nenita> It honestly sounds like the system is trying to do the thing, but the SSH server doesn't have the appropriate permissions or capabilities to handle whatever the command is supposed to do."
432,2019-01-29T14:24:43.100900,Nenita,that is the only option i have left to conclude
432,2019-01-29T14:24:48.101100,Nenita,i was reading that on one post
432,2019-01-29T14:25:04.101600,Nenita,<@Carmen>
432,2019-01-29T14:25:17.102100,Carmen,"In Linux, I'd think it was related to not having a Windowing system like X available, but I'm not sure how Windows environments handle that sort of thing."
432,2019-01-29T14:25:21.102300,Mozelle,Ok I get that but I am misunderstanding then. How do I get to the values in the json then?
432,2019-01-29T14:25:43.103700,Carmen,"Plus you have the interaction with the SSH server process trying to start it up, and all the permissions that would involve, as well as then how the SSH server is going to send that back to you."
432,2019-01-29T14:25:49.103900,Nenita,i think a good option to wing out is to test out ssh from linux to windows and see if these commands execute on my own pc through vm
432,2019-01-29T14:26:10.104400,Nenita,"if it works through vm to my pc, then its concluded that it may be permission based"
432,2019-01-29T14:26:41.104800,Carmen,"Out of curosity, what actual programs are you trying to execute with `start`?"
432,2019-01-29T14:26:52.105200,Nenita,just open a folder lol
432,2019-01-29T14:27:03.105600,Nenita,simplest test to see if the commands affected the remote pc
432,2019-01-29T14:28:27.106500,Carmen,"That sounds like a GUI-based thing, tbh. I'd probably have gone for a Windows equivalent of `touch` though. <https://superuser.com/a/764721>"
432,2019-01-29T14:30:32.107700,Jonas,"Using a string. ""key"", not key"
432,2019-01-29T14:30:41.108300,Jonas,this is a <#C07EW4DNE|learning_python> question IMO
432,2019-01-29T14:30:48.108700,Nenita,"im not sure if that's gunna help me get far. ultimate throughout all the trouble i've been accruing, ultimately i just want to be able to run a single bat file just so I have control on my end."
432,2019-01-29T14:30:51.108900,Jonas,so you might get better help there
432,2019-01-29T14:32:07.111100,Carmen,"Well, you said you were wanting to test if the commands affect the remote PC. That would let you know that you can affect it. If you need to interact with specific programs in specific ways, that's a whole different ballgame."
432,2019-01-29T14:32:20.111800,Raven,"Usually `start` will execute a program in a different window. If you're in an SSH session, you won't see that other window."
432,2019-01-29T14:32:29.112400,Carmen,"And depending on what you're aiming for, you might be better served with using a Windows integration library via Python script."
432,2019-01-29T14:32:29.112500,Nenita,<@Carmen> oh i see now
432,2019-01-29T14:32:36.112800,Nenita,good idea. my apologies
432,2019-01-29T14:32:56.113400,Nenita,any good libraries?
432,2019-01-29T14:33:16.114200,Carmen,"It's been years. Let me grab my Grey Hat Python book and see what he uses, and go from there."
432,2019-01-29T14:33:53.114900,Kiera,"<@Mozelle> the issue is that the key you put in between the `[…]` braces is a python expression.  You're giving an expression of `items` - which means to look up the name `items` in the current symbol table and find the value associated with it.  You haven't defined any name `items`, so it's telling you that the name `items` is not found.  To look up a literal string value as a key, you need to give it a literal string - surrounded by quotes (e.g. `'…'` or `""…""`)"
432,2019-01-29T14:34:35.115300,Kiera,"so specifically, you should be looking for `test[""items""]`"
432,2019-01-29T14:35:26.115500,Mozelle,"Thanks, I do not know why I was forgetting the """
432,2019-01-29T14:36:04.116500,Mozelle,"Yes thanks I do not know why in my mind I had added the """
432,2019-01-29T14:36:26.116900,Nenita,<@Raven> yea i was hoping it would execute it on the remote pc. thankfully i am visually remoted in so i can see if anything happens
432,2019-01-29T14:37:54.117400,Raven,And is this batch file on the remote pc?
432,2019-01-29T14:38:04.117800,Nenita,yea
432,2019-01-29T14:38:17.118400,Carmen,"Ah, so he uses `ctypes` and directly uses the system DLLs. I'm not sure that's the best way to go about things."
432,2019-01-29T14:38:24.118600,Nenita,i have a full environment set up so thankfully i can see and manage everything on my pc.
432,2019-01-29T14:39:40.119100,Carmen,"If you're running GUI stuff, you might give <https://pywinauto.github.io/> a shot."
432,2019-01-29T14:40:20.119600,Nenita,oh yea. that will defintely make up for what i am trying to do
432,2019-01-29T14:40:39.120100,Nenita,its frustrating that i sometimes am unable to find solutions like so
432,2019-01-29T14:41:24.120600,Carmen,I find that it's all about knowing what keywords to smash together in a Google search bar.
432,2019-01-29T14:41:47.121100,Carmen,"In that case, ""python windows gui automation"" popped up that project as the top result."
432,2019-01-29T14:41:49.121200,Nenita,right lmao
432,2019-01-29T14:42:11.121700,Nenita,speaking; do you know if pywinauto is functional over networks?
432,2019-01-29T14:42:36.122500,Carmen,You'll need to have it installed locally AFAIK. The Python script will need to be locally running as well.
432,2019-01-29T14:43:17.123400,Nenita,ah shoot
432,2019-01-29T14:43:21.123700,Carmen,"If it's driving GUI stuff, it's going to be making system-level calls, and I don't know of any way to be doing that remotely without *something* running on the target system."
432,2019-01-29T14:43:29.123900,Nenita,im trying to avoid having to install anything on our remote server
432,2019-01-29T14:44:16.124500,Nenita,but its something i can work with
432,2019-01-29T14:44:24.124800,Nenita,i bet i can fool around and get something going
432,2019-01-29T14:47:28.125000,Nenita,this may be useful <https://ss64.com/nt/schtasks.html>
432,2019-01-29T14:51:10.125200,Mozelle,"Seriously thanks, every where else in my code I had the correct string represented and I just got stuck..."
432,2019-01-29T14:51:12.125400,Nenita,I appreciate all the help
433,2019-01-29T13:39:52.070100,Ashley,"<@Nenita> I'm coming in late and didn't read everything, but with SSH, you're basically operating entirely on the machine you ""SSH'd"" into. So when you SSH into a linux machine, you're limited to a linux environment, so you can't run .bat files, because those are windows only"
433,2019-01-29T13:43:33.071600,Ashley,"also, if you write a .bat script that SSH's into a linux machine for you, it won't run the commands in the .bat script after the SSH command until after the SSH command is done running, which means killing the SSH connection"
433,2019-01-29T13:47:37.071900,Jonas,`print(form.save())`
434,2019-01-29T14:17:08.083500,Carmen,"<@Nenita> Summary version of your issues so far, so that we're all on the same page (please correct something I get wrong here):
• You're trying to SSH into a Windows box from an Ubuntu box.
• You want to execute a batch file on the Windows box via the SSH connection.
• You can connect just fine, but the batch file fails.
• Certain commands within the batch file fail, but not all of them."
435,2019-01-29T15:23:18.126200,Granville,Does anyone know if there's a point where you would use a nested function over a class?
435,2019-01-29T15:28:20.126500,Ashley,decorators
435,2019-01-29T15:29:16.127400,Ashley,classes are good for when you need to keep track of the state of some data and need functionality that's dependent on that data's state
435,2019-01-29T15:30:48.128900,Hiroko,Or if you want a custom handler for a callback.  Like in the pybreaker circuit breaker library 
435,2019-01-29T15:31:07.129100,Ashley,that too
435,2019-01-29T15:32:43.130500,Ashley,sometimes you just want the ability to create a one-off function that you can change a little bit about without going through the hassle of making a class with callable instances
435,2019-01-29T15:32:44.130600,Raven,"I would argue that unless you explicitly have a package of state _and_ operations that operate primarily on that state alone, you shouldn't have a class"
435,2019-01-29T15:33:02.131100,Raven,"I think Java has a lot to answer for, with the ""everything should be a class"" attitude it created"
435,2019-01-29T15:33:05.131300,Ashley,"yeah, not a bad argument"
435,2019-01-29T15:33:16.131500,Ashley,haha I agree

435,2019-01-29T15:34:20.132600,Hiroko,"that’s inside a class, so you can see there’s a defined method inside the context"
435,2019-01-29T15:35:03.133200,Hiroko,"so, the seesion executes, and the callback executes when complete.  It just updates the data"
435,2019-01-29T15:35:18.133700,Hiroko,`FuturesSession` comes from `requests_futures`
435,2019-01-29T15:36:13.134300,Hiroko,"so that allows a bulk broadcast call to execute over a number of workers to different services, and act as a generator"

435,2019-01-29T15:37:15.135700,Hiroko,so it makes sense to have it as a nested function inside a context manager
435,2019-01-29T15:43:37.136800,Raven,I think that's another good point - nested functions (and classes) mean you can avoid polluting the global namespace with things that aren't going to get used outside of a specific context
435,2019-01-29T15:44:14.137600,Hiroko,"precisely, and for my purposes, that’s pretty much the primary usage"
435,2019-01-29T15:44:25.138100,Carmen,"True, but isn't that what namespaces in general are supposed to handle?"
435,2019-01-29T15:44:49.139000,Hiroko,"I use inheritance and composition alot, which means mixins and base classes.  and this usage pattern tends to clean things up a bit more and increase understandability"
435,2019-01-29T15:45:03.139300,Carmen,"I was trying to come up with an equivalent of ""related function aggregation"" as per Scala objects, but really, namespaces should do that AFAIK."
435,2019-01-29T15:53:52.141000,Sylvie,So I am playing with some parsing and processing of an html doc in the same folder as the python doc I'm working in but I continue to get an error from debug in VS code that the doc I'm referencing doesn't exist. Is there something I need to type before the name of the doc?
435,2019-01-29T15:54:33.141400,Hiroko,would help to see what you’re doing

435,2019-01-29T15:55:56.142700,Gemma,either make sure you're in the directory that the html file exists or `open()` the absolute path to the file

435,2019-01-29T15:59:58.148400,Jonas,I would take a look at some of the suggestions above and see if they help

435,2019-01-29T16:00:23.149300,Sylvie,I'm looking where I can add the suggestions

435,2019-01-29T16:01:24.150900,Jonas,"if you add the print statement like I suggested, we could fix this by making the path relative to that"
435,2019-01-29T16:01:46.151100,Ashley,it looks like vs code
435,2019-01-29T16:02:07.151400,Raven,Right
435,2019-01-29T16:02:39.152300,Raven,"That error is saying that it's confused about your string used for a path name... it probably has a `\u` in it (e.g. `\users`) and that starts to look like a special Unicode character, to Python"
435,2019-01-29T16:02:46.152700,Sylvie,It seems like it looks at the path error and just quits the code.
435,2019-01-29T16:02:51.152800,Raven,Swap the backslashes `\` for forward slashes `/` and try again
435,2019-01-29T16:02:59.153200,Raven,"Yes, it will stop as soon as it hits the first error."
435,2019-01-29T16:03:45.153900,Raven,"(There's some other way to get Python to ignore the backslashes, but I forget what it is. Perhaps an `r` prefix. Maybe someone else can comment?)"
435,2019-01-29T16:04:18.154200,Sylvie,So switching from \ to / fixed it.
435,2019-01-29T16:04:31.154500,Raven,cool

435,2019-01-29T17:53:57.159100,Gemma,"yep, and to add, `@property` makes foo read only"
435,2019-01-29T17:54:36.159900,Roxanne,That was the underlying question
435,2019-01-29T17:54:48.160400,Roxanne,<@Gemma> ty !
435,2019-01-29T17:54:51.160500,Gemma,so `A().foo` will work but `A().foo = 2` shouldn't
435,2019-01-29T17:55:35.160900,Roxanne,"right in the bullseye, thank you !"
435,2019-01-29T18:13:13.162700,Roxanne,and I've learnt it by the hard way
436,2019-01-29T15:54:58.141500,Sylvie,None

436,2019-01-29T15:56:59.144100,Jonas,"also, the conditional is redundant"

436,2019-01-29T15:57:40.145400,Jonas,"if you want to debug this issue, add this line to the main(): `print(os.getcwd())`"
436,2019-01-29T15:58:21.147100,Gemma,"yeah, all good suggestions here"
437,2019-01-29T18:12:29.161500,Genesis,"wow, in this case foo realy is read only.."
437,2019-01-29T18:12:49.162200,Genesis,"I was going to mention a dirty dirty hack, but the way this method is written, it truly can not be changed"
437,2019-01-29T18:13:52.163500,Genesis,but uh... whats the point of foo always being 1?
437,2019-01-29T18:14:03.163800,Roxanne,it's actually a dictionary
437,2019-01-29T18:14:51.164800,Roxanne,"self.current_status = new_dict()
and KABOOM  :bomb:"
437,2019-01-29T18:15:27.165200,Roxanne,"`current_status` will be foo, the update is bar"
437,2019-01-29T18:18:25.166000,Jonas,"Be careful, the property might not be assignable but the value will be mutable"
437,2019-01-29T19:14:57.167400,Jonas,each time `foo` is accessed then the property method will be called again
437,2019-01-29T19:15:24.168200,Jonas,"so if foo creates an object (like a dictionary), it will be a new one each time"
437,2019-01-29T19:15:58.169200,Jonas,"which is a downside of properties, they can hide expensive operations. If `a.foo` creates a large dictionary, people often write"
437,2019-01-29T19:16:17.170300,Genesis,interesting
437,2019-01-29T19:16:22.170400,Jonas,"`something, something2 = a.foo['x'], a.foo['y']`"
437,2019-01-29T19:16:36.170900,Jonas,so you're calling `foo` twice and creating two large dictionaries only to throw them away
437,2019-01-29T19:16:47.171200,Genesis,"ya, I would find it very very weird, for me, that `a.foo != a.foo`"
437,2019-01-29T19:17:09.171600,Genesis,why make it a property and not just a method?
437,2019-01-29T19:17:15.171900,Jonas,"If foo returns the *same* object, then it's true"
437,2019-01-29T19:17:40.172500,Genesis,`a.foo is not a.foo`?
437,2019-01-29T19:17:59.173000,Jonas,"```@property
def foo(self):
   return self._foo```"
437,2019-01-29T19:18:08.173400,Jonas,then `a.foo is a.foo`
437,2019-01-29T19:18:10.173600,Jonas,but
437,2019-01-29T19:18:34.174200,Jonas,"```@property
def foo(self):
   return {'a': 'b'}```"
437,2019-01-29T19:18:41.174500,Jonas,then `a.foo is not a.foo`
437,2019-01-29T19:19:05.175100,Jonas,lots of uses for properties. sometimes the ephemeral nature is useful
437,2019-01-29T19:19:30.175500,Jonas,usually if it's an _expensive_ operation I'd make it a function call
437,2019-01-29T19:19:35.175700,Jonas,or use a caching mechanism
437,2019-01-29T19:31:58.177000,Genesis,"<@Jonas> but if its truly ephemeral, why even use a property? That isn't what I would expect as a consumer of your api"
437,2019-01-29T19:34:36.177500,Jonas,"aiohttp uses a property on a request object, `request.config`"
437,2019-01-29T19:34:50.177900,Jonas,"this is a dictionary made from various different configurations, merged together"
437,2019-01-29T19:36:09.178300,Jonas,you kind of want this to be ephemeral
438,2019-01-29T18:55:15.166900,Genesis,"wait, so `a.foo` makes foo get reset?"

440,2019-01-29T21:00:39.179200,Conchita,"This tool will also be used for low-traffic keywords in short timeframes (each minute) so receiving zero value entries will be a common occurrence.

440,2019-01-29T21:01:44.179400,Conchita,"But to me, that sounds like treating the symptoms instead of dealing with the root of the issue, no?"

440,2019-01-29T21:10:53.179900,Conchita,"What do you recommend me to do to figure this out?

Should I read upon `async` and if so any specifics OR is that a rathole better avoided for a beginner like me (you hinted to this last night)

444,2019-01-30T00:45:05.188700,Valeri,You can add the timestamp to your log everytime they are initialized
444,2019-01-30T00:46:00.188900,Valeri,Or you can log the time when they were updated. For this you can compare their previous values to the current values and log the time if their is an actual change

445,2019-01-30T01:57:10.190300,Riva,Hi friends..
445,2019-01-30T01:58:37.191700,Riva,Do you have any idea to create windows Application to select list of pdf files and display all files on application.
445,2019-01-30T02:03:20.192200,Sasha,Is there any particular reason you want to build this? There are a zillion PDF readers for Windows.
445,2019-01-30T02:10:49.192800,Riva,I dont know my manager gave this task to develop that application
445,2019-01-30T02:12:05.194300,Sasha,Great! Install Acrobat and tell him you made it.  :wink:
445,2019-01-30T02:12:28.194600,Riva,actually if one pdf contain 100 above pages then by using we can select particular pages and make it into another pdf are give to print option
445,2019-01-30T02:12:45.195000,Riva,Nice joke
445,2019-01-30T02:19:23.195400,Carmen,<@Riva> So you just want to combine all the PDFs into a single PDF for display and possible printing?
445,2019-01-30T02:21:47.196000,Riva,yes
445,2019-01-30T02:21:53.196300,Carmen,"With page selection options, it looks like."
445,2019-01-30T02:21:58.196500,Riva,In windows application
445,2019-01-30T02:23:27.197900,Carmen,Look at the PyPDF2 library.
445,2019-01-30T02:23:28.198100,Carmen,<https://stackoverflow.com/a/17304537>

445,2019-01-30T02:24:46.199800,Carmen,"For your page selection portion, however, you'll probably need to break out into the actual PDFReader and PDFWriter classes, displaying which pages in which PDF should or shouldn't be included in the final PDF and acting accordingly."
445,2019-01-30T02:25:38.201100,Riva,Actually this entire process has to be develop in windows application using GUI
445,2019-01-30T02:27:48.203800,Carmen,You're still going to need something underneath the GUI to do the PDF merging.
445,2019-01-30T02:28:38.204900,Riva,yeah but i didn't get any solution to develop
445,2019-01-30T02:29:01.206200,Carmen,<https://docs.python.org/3/faq/gui.html> Pick one that works for Windows and use it to build your GUI according to whatever specs you have.
445,2019-01-30T02:29:28.206700,Riva,by using PySimpleGUI i am able to display the selected pdf.
445,2019-01-30T02:30:43.207600,Riva,But i want to display the list of pages in sidebar
445,2019-01-30T02:32:17.209100,Leida,<@Nenita> Any luck with your SSH endeavours? The answer i posted should help you. With SSH you log in to the windows machine so even the linux to windows examples are valid - you are running the actual commands on the windows machine. You say that opening a folder does not work but SSH is not a GUI enabled system by default. If you try to open something like file explorer then it wont show on the screen of the windows machine because it is opened in the background by a user that has no GUI. To really open a folder you use `cd` which works on both windows and linux. If you really need to open some graphical interfaces you are better off with loging in  to the machine with RDP or some tool like TeamViewer. And if you are hell bent on SSH to do work with GUI tools you need to set the gui to run with in a user that has access to GUI and set the correct access rights and accept eula and what not. The answers you find that SSH from linux should work exactly the same as SSH from windows to windows. Unless there is mention of X server - then its linux specific xD
445,2019-01-30T02:34:44.209400,Riva,Ok thank you
445,2019-01-30T02:44:07.210400,Carmen,<@Riva> Here's some sample code you can use in your underlying PDF manipulation.
445,2019-01-30T05:38:08.212000,Riva,Thank you but i want to display on windows application by using GUI .This i already tried.
446,2019-01-30T02:35:12.209500,Leida,how is it going with your piece of code?
447,2019-01-30T05:40:02.213100,Elene,hi <@Shena> Do you already have a working application with python gui?
447,2019-01-30T05:43:18.214200,Elene,If you want to display list of pages as in previews in your sidebar then you'll probably need something like thumbnails which can be scrolled through

I was wondering how best in sqlalchemy to prevent duplicate inserts based on the last event id when working with time. e.g. exit can come after entry but no 2 exits in a row or no 2 entries in a row.

451,2019-01-30T09:03:38.235900,Jacelyn,"<@Elene> just following up on this, the unique constraint would prevent duplicate events being inserted at the same time, correct?"

451,2019-01-30T09:07:42.238300,Jacelyn,"<@Elene> the event_id isn’t unique itself, it could be in the table lots of times"

451,2019-01-30T09:14:58.239600,Elene,"Further if you use, insert do nothing then you won't end up with duplicate values in your table"
451,2019-01-30T09:16:21.239900,Jacelyn,Yeah but I’ve seen this happen where the time might be a millisecond later and then in that case it would still insert.
451,2019-01-30T09:16:36.240100,Elene,If you're using timestamp with timezone it can be upto microsecond
451,2019-01-30T09:17:03.240300,Elene,Can you give me an example? of 2 timestamps that are unique upto millseconds?
451,2019-01-30T09:17:14.240500,Elene,I can check if one is ignored or not
451,2019-01-30T09:17:38.240700,Elene,Is it the same as the bad table example?
451,2019-01-30T09:17:46.240900,Jacelyn,Yeah it’d be the same as that.
451,2019-01-30T09:17:56.241100,Jacelyn,So can you specify the unique precision on a timestamp?
451,2019-01-30T09:18:23.241800,Bernita,i have a unique string and wat to convert it to a unique INT to put away. no need to be crypto
451,2019-01-30T09:18:27.242100,Bernita,what would be the way to go?
451,2019-01-30T09:18:28.242200,Elene,<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/datatype-datetime.html>
451,2019-01-30T09:19:08.242400,Elene,I currently have a setup for user events and i haven't ended up with a duplicate value yet
451,2019-01-30T09:19:57.242700,Elene,so you need to convert a string to int? i don't understand the unique part
451,2019-01-30T09:20:27.242900,Bernita,well with every scrape I have a title. with this title I want to make a unique ID
451,2019-01-30T09:20:36.243100,Bernita,since an int is way faster to put away in sql
451,2019-01-30T09:21:06.243300,Bernita,"so `"" this is a title""`, and when I hash it to an int will be `""34504038584""` (example)"
451,2019-01-30T09:22:01.243600,Hiroko,why not make a hash?
451,2019-01-30T09:22:36.243900,Hiroko,"that’ll be fast, with low collision probability"
451,2019-01-30T09:23:31.244100,Bernita,<@Hiroko> and ofcourse python gots a function `hash()`. did not know about it
451,2019-01-30T09:23:32.244300,Bernita,thanks
451,2019-01-30T09:24:56.244500,Hiroko,"yeah, that’s whats used for dicts"
451,2019-01-30T09:25:07.244700,Hiroko,sometimes you’ll come across “object is not hashable” errors

451,2019-01-30T09:56:23.249800,Carmen,You shouldn't need to dive into the ad itself to pull the URL. Wherever you're scraping the title from should also have the URL.

I'm trying to run my first website using Flask and storing user information with Flask-sqlalchemy.

When I run my script the website works perfectly fine. The user can go to the correct page and input some data which appears to save to a database as it holds all the information and prints it out to the user each time they submit something.

However it does not create a .db file in the directory on pycharm so I cant actually find the database. What am I missing?

Thanks in advance"

454,2019-01-30T10:29:26.253300,Jonas,This is a common issue with PyCharm
454,2019-01-30T10:29:52.253900,Jonas,when you run your app it is likely running it in a different directory. If you select the 'website' run from the top-right dropdown and edit it
454,2019-01-30T10:30:15.254500,Jonas,check the `working directory` option and ensure it is pointing to the path of your project

456,2019-01-30T11:58:32.269900,Harris,chain would create one task from the prior result

458,2019-01-30T16:40:39.307400,Candi,"<@Sparkle> can you explain what this means if re.search('^(https?|www\.)', string)"
458,2019-01-30T16:40:50.307700,Candi,i am beginner
458,2019-01-30T16:41:03.308000,Sparkle,"it just means check if the string starts with either `http`, `https` or `www.`  the period is escaped because otherwise `.` matches any character but `\.` matches literal period"
458,2019-01-30T16:41:36.308500,Candi,oh cool
458,2019-01-30T16:42:01.309300,Sparkle,`https?` the `?` makes the `s` conditional - to shorten it from writing out both
458,2019-01-30T16:42:10.309700,Candi,and how to check for urls such as <http://amazon.com|amazon.com> or <http://amazon.uk|amazon.uk>
458,2019-01-30T16:44:20.311800,Sparkle,"i mean you can pass a general pattern to hopefully catch most cases - basically `\S+\.[A-Za-z]{2,3}`  usually url regex are more robust - but in the interest of not needing to know about all edge cases and just wanting to flag if the string looks like it might be a url - `\S+` means any consecutive non-spaces, then a literal `.` followed by ether `2 or 3 letters`"
458,2019-01-30T16:44:38.312400,Claudine,REGEX YOU SAY!?!?!?!
458,2019-01-30T16:44:43.312700,Sparkle,"so even if its `.<http://co.uk|co.uk>` it would still ring true for `non spaced char, followed by 2 or 3` characters"
458,2019-01-30T16:47:31.313900,Sparkle,"you could couple both patterns into: ```if re.search('(^(https?|www\.)|\S+\.[A-Za-z]{2,3})', string)``` to check for either of those cases `|` meaning “or”"
458,2019-01-30T16:52:09.315100,Candi,wow just 1 statement can check for all the cases thats awesome
458,2019-01-30T17:00:32.316400,Candi,"<@Sparkle> after if re.search('(^(https?|www\.)|\S+\.[A-Za-z]{2,3})',x): its giving expected string or bytes-like object error"
458,2019-01-30T17:05:19.316900,Granville,"<@Clemmie>, I'm not seeing a `return` statement with the `**kwargs` parameter as being valid. Should I post the error message separately?"

458,2019-01-30T17:12:49.320400,Clemmie,No worries
458,2019-01-30T17:14:33.322200,Marth,"<@Candi> I might be misunderstanding your dataset, but perhaps you can do this with pandas directly (instead of the for/if loop) ?
Since 'data' is the name of your dataframe...something like this might work:  `data[data.name.str.startswith('http')]`
""name"" is whatever the column you want to search is called.  So if it's called ""company"" just replace `name` with `company`"

462,2019-01-30T17:33:55.325900,Hiroko,I had that issue when trying to build a react app on an amazon t2.small instance.  Didn’t have enough memory to run the build and got something similar
462,2019-01-30T17:34:25.326300,Hiroko,"as is, seems like you’re out of free memory to run the build"
462,2019-01-30T18:08:57.327800,Hiroko,<@Tasia> <https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues/2940> might be related 
462,2019-01-30T19:01:38.332600,Carmen,"Possibly because if you expand all of the keys in a dict ala `.format(**vardic)`, you're going to get key errors if there are additional keys within the dict that aren't in the string. It'll also throw errors (I believe) if there is a placeholder in the string that isn't in `vardic`."
462,2019-01-30T19:13:17.333700,Carmen,"Yeah, just tested it empirically, and extra keys doesn't cause a problem."
462,2019-01-30T19:13:29.334200,Carmen,But not having enough keys does indeed throw a KeyError
462,2019-01-30T22:45:15.334600,Devin,"Anyone have tips for comparing two lists of dictionaries on multiple keys? For example I have two lists which contain dicts that both have the following keys:
```
list_a = [{'key1':'abc',
	 	'key2':123,
                'keyX':'blip'},
	      {'key1':'def',
	       'key2':456,
                'keyX':'blip'}]


list_b = [{'key1':'abc',

	       {'key1':'def',
	 	 'key2':456},
	        {'key1':'ghi',
	   	 'key2': 123}]
```
I’m trying to compare on key1 and key2 and generate a list that contains the difference, in this case it would return something like:
```
list_of_differences = [
	{'key1':'ghi',
	 'key2': 123}
]

```"
463,2019-01-30T18:23:11.329500,Sasha,"<@Francesca> It's basically doing string variable substitution. If `""key""` is in `vardic`, then it replaces `""{key}""` in the string with the associated value in the dict."
463,2019-01-30T18:27:10.330200,Sasha,It's not immediately clear to me why your colleague implemented this instead of using `str.format()`.
463,2019-01-30T19:12:37.333400,Sasha,"I think additional entries in the dict are okay, since people use the `**locals()` trick sometimes. But good point about not complaining about missing keys."

I am trying this code:

from moviepy.video.tools.tracking import Trajectory

clip = VideoFileClip(""sample.mp4"")

# (after the first run of the script for instance).
trajectories = manual_tracking(clip,

traj, = Trajectory.load_list('traj.txt')

clip_blurred = clip.fx( vfx.headblur, traj, 50)

clip_blurred.write_videofile('sonmenew.mp4', bitrate=""3000k"")

It's for a single person, How I Can use it for multiple objects?
Anybody can help me?"

 traj, traj1, = Trajectory.load_list('traj.txt')

468,2019-01-31T02:40:03.352400,Leida,thats what i like with python - you can hack it to work and it wont yell at you
468,2019-01-31T02:43:39.352600,Leida,the stream probably tells you that there is a problem but you are not listening to it proper. Your solution if it works it works
468,2019-01-31T02:46:40.354200,Sasha,The `numpy` library has good matrix-manipulation functions.

468,2019-01-31T02:53:02.355100,Sasha,It looks weird that your `guess` has only 2 elements... I would have expected 6.
468,2019-01-31T02:58:34.355600,Sasha,"I suspect something is wrong with your matrix axes, that the `dot` call wants a 1x6 instead of a 6x1 or something. I'd start printing out some of your intermediate results in the loop and see if they have the right dimensions."

468,2019-01-31T03:02:54.356600,Leida,"Your code dips into using threads. Threads are like different dimensions for data processing. In one the data grabbing is done, in the other the processing and saving. The problem with threads is passing data between them. You can have problems where two different threads try to write or read the same data and the outcome is never good. For you the library you use is pretty good and hides those problems from you. So in general you dont need to know much about threads to get the job done. The magic i was looking for is exactly that it seemed there to be code that would take the whole thread to do work and not allow the other part to work but somehow it did. Reading about the library in use cleared my confusion - there is a separate thread for its work."
468,2019-01-31T03:06:23.356900,Leida,It seems to me that the stream not only returns you the values it grabbed off twitter but also sends you all the errors that happend on the other thread. For debugging you should figure out how to read the errors the stream sends you. Your solution of simply restarting the stream may well be the only option even if you knew what the error was. Only problem is that you try to reconnect for ever even if the error is that you no longer have internet connection or something similar.

473,2019-01-31T10:25:49.371600,Jolanda,Yes
474,2019-01-31T10:33:29.371800,Cleotilde,you could do something like this
474,2019-01-31T10:33:37.372100,Cleotilde,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; num = 39999
&gt;&gt;&gt; num_float = num / 100.00
&gt;&gt;&gt; '${:,.2f}'.format(num_float)
'$399.99'
```"
474,2019-01-31T10:33:42.372300,Cleotilde,if you want the dollar sign
474,2019-01-31T10:36:13.373300,Faith,"So I’m trying to work with a subprocess where the subprocess is asking for input, but I want to store the output"
474,2019-01-31T10:36:44.373900,Faith,input gets passed to the process. But as I’m storing the output in subprocess.PIPE it isn’t being shown on the screen
474,2019-01-31T10:36:59.374300,Faith,I’m probably missing something but I rarely use subprocess
474,2019-01-31T10:37:24.374700,Faith,Anyone know a way to print the output while still capturing it?
474,2019-01-31T10:39:39.375900,Carmen,"If you want to capture the output as well as print it, you'll need to either get a file-type object that you can pass into pipe that will store and print at the same time, or you'll need to be regularly printing the file object you passed as the stdout."
474,2019-01-31T12:04:15.377200,Hiroko,"so, the first bit, `class SpaceAge`"
474,2019-01-31T12:04:37.377700,Hiroko,the parameter for that is for anything that class should inherit from a parent class
474,2019-01-31T12:05:44.378800,Hiroko,"lets say you have

```class Shape(object):
    # methods here

class Circle(Shape):
    # methods here that can ovveride methods in Shape
```"
474,2019-01-31T12:09:12.381500,Hiroko,"so, lets say you want to have a method `area` in `Shape

```class Shape(object):
    def area(self):
        raise NotImplementedError('Shape doesn't define a default implementation of area')

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, diameter):
         self.diameter = diameter
    def area(self):
        return (math.pi / 4) * math.pow(self.diameter, 2)
```"
474,2019-01-31T12:09:26.381900,Hiroko,"so, you can do ```s = Shape()```"
474,2019-01-31T12:09:54.382600,Hiroko,"but if you do `s.area()`, you’ll get your error, because it explifictly raises the not implemented error"
474,2019-01-31T12:10:50.383400,Hiroko,"however, if you do ```c = Circle(2947)
c.area()  # outputs 6821033.038```"
474,2019-01-31T12:11:22.384100,Hiroko,"so, for your example, you can remove `e_seconds` from `SpaceAge`"
474,2019-01-31T12:12:21.385100,Hiroko,"its already a parameter for your init, so you pass it in like

```s_a = SpaceAge(8376456)
s_a.jupiter()  # calls the method
```"
474,2019-01-31T12:12:29.385400,Hiroko,"but with your existing definiton, it doesn’t do anything"
474,2019-01-31T12:13:16.386700,Hiroko,"remember, methods have scope.  so if you’re defining a variable inside a method, that method isn’t available outside.  so, calling `jupiter` above just has `j_seconds` available inside that method with no way to access it"
474,2019-01-31T12:13:34.387400,Hiroko,because you haven’t done `return seconds * 11.862615`
474,2019-01-31T12:20:22.388300,Leopoldo,"<@Hiroko> that is a lot for me to digest, I’ll give it some thought and thank you for the help!"
474,2019-01-31T12:20:51.388700,Hiroko,"yes, OOP is pretty difficult to grasp your head around at times"
474,2019-01-31T12:21:10.389100,Hiroko,and there are times you’re just too confused to articulate the question that you’re confused with :smile:
474,2019-01-31T12:21:27.389600,Leopoldo,I very much feel like that right now
474,2019-01-31T12:21:40.389900,Hiroko,"been there, done that :slightly_smiling_face:"
474,2019-01-31T12:21:47.390200,Leopoldo,lol thank you
474,2019-01-31T12:21:54.390500,Hiroko,what might help is to think of `class ...` as a blueprint
474,2019-01-31T12:22:10.390900,Hiroko,it contains the stuff to create the thing you want and the behavior you deem necessary
474,2019-01-31T12:22:52.391500,Hiroko,"and instances, eg, `c = SpaceAge(...)`, just follow that blueprint"
474,2019-01-31T12:24:32.392700,Leopoldo,Could you make it even simpler for me. What goes in the first parenthesis of Class SpaceAge(?)
474,2019-01-31T12:24:56.393200,Leopoldo,And where does that (?) need to be defined?
474,2019-01-31T12:26:18.394000,Hiroko,it defines what things that class should have by default
474,2019-01-31T12:26:44.394600,Hiroko,"if nothing is specified, or the params are omitted, it just inherits from `object`, which is the base python class"
474,2019-01-31T12:27:08.394900,Hiroko,look at my example above with Shape and Circle
474,2019-01-31T12:27:31.395300,Hiroko,"we want Circle to have the properties of Shape, because a circle is a shape, right?"
474,2019-01-31T12:27:51.395800,Hiroko,"it has area, boundaries, color, etc"
474,2019-01-31T12:28:22.396500,Hiroko,"so you can define those properties in Shape, and have Circle say “hey, no need to rewrite all that code, I can just pull it in for myself”"
474,2019-01-31T12:29:02.396900,Leopoldo,Hmm ok that makes sense.
474,2019-01-31T12:29:30.397500,Hiroko,"so, each class has a constructor, and in puython, thats the `__init__(self)` method"
474,2019-01-31T12:29:56.398100,Hiroko,"now, `self` is an explicit way for you to refer to a specific instance of a class"
474,2019-01-31T12:30:17.398700,Leopoldo,ok I understand so far
474,2019-01-31T12:30:18.398800,Hiroko,"you know, just like you can have a whole bunch of M&amp;Ms in your hands, doesn’t"
474,2019-01-31T12:30:32.399200,Hiroko,"one can be green, another can be red, etc"
474,2019-01-31T12:30:44.399700,Hiroko,"each M&amp;M is an instance of a class, if you will"
474,2019-01-31T12:30:52.400000,Clemmie,<@Leopoldo> This is a pretty good introduction to object oriented programming concepts <https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/object-oriented-programming-explained/>
474,2019-01-31T12:33:58.401300,Leopoldo,ok <@Hiroko> makes sense. I get a little confused where things are being defined and where to apply those.
474,2019-01-31T12:34:07.401800,Leopoldo,But I’m getting a little more of an understanding.
474,2019-01-31T12:36:35.404300,Carmen,"To be slightly more explicit about the the first line of the class definition, `class SpaceAge(?)`, putting something where the `?` is is optional. That slot is where you say, ""This class that I'm defining inherits it's methods and attributes from this other class"". It's a way to reuse code without having to violate the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself). By inheriting from another class, you can rely on that class to define everything it does, and then you just modify the things that you need to act differently in yours."
474,2019-01-31T12:37:13.405200,Carmen,"You can inherit from multiple other classes, just separating those class names from each other with a comma, and it will give you all the attributes and methods from each of them."
474,2019-01-31T12:38:02.406700,Carmen,"If you don't inherit from another class explicitly, the system will say your class inherits from the built-in Object class."
474,2019-01-31T12:38:19.407000,Leopoldo,That is really helpful <@Carmen> I wouldn’t enter anything there unless I want it inherited from another class
474,2019-01-31T12:38:24.407200,Carmen,Precisely.
474,2019-01-31T12:39:19.408600,Leopoldo,Can I inherit a value from a variable? Like my e_seconds? Or would I need to create another class with that value?
474,2019-01-31T12:40:09.409300,Hiroko,you can inherit from classes or methods
474,2019-01-31T12:40:10.409400,Carmen,"No, because your variable is not a class. It's an instance of a class (in your case, an integer)."
474,2019-01-31T12:40:27.410200,Hiroko,but that;s a distinction that really doesn’t matter at this point
474,2019-01-31T12:40:33.410500,Carmen,"Ooo, method inheritance is something new for me. *Googles*"
474,2019-01-31T12:40:39.410700,Hiroko,look for mixins
474,2019-01-31T12:40:48.410800,Leopoldo,ok <@Hiroko> <@Carmen>
474,2019-01-31T12:40:55.411000,Leopoldo,thank you both
474,2019-01-31T12:41:17.411400,Carmen,"Oooooh, you're talking about overriding previously defined methods, yes?"
474,2019-01-31T12:41:39.411700,Hiroko,or adding in new ones that really don’t belong to a specific class
474,2019-01-31T12:42:03.412200,Carmen,"Aha. Then yes, I'm familiar with that. I just hadn't ever heard of it described as inheriting from a method."
474,2019-01-31T12:42:13.412400,Hiroko,"ah, gotcha"
474,2019-01-31T12:42:25.412700,Hiroko,"you can do it both, from class or from method"
474,2019-01-31T12:43:35.413000,Carmen,Can you toss me an example link? My google-fu isn't coming up with what I think you're talking about.
474,2019-01-31T12:46:30.413700,Hiroko,"damn, could have sworn i had a link to function mixin"
474,2019-01-31T12:46:37.414000,Hiroko,"but no, mixins are a simple class"
474,2019-01-31T12:52:05.414500,Carmen,Hm. Perhaps something in an older version of Python?
474,2019-01-31T12:54:09.415500,Clemmie,"I think you can inherit from anything, but your MRO stack may get confused. I mean by default it inherits from `object` and everything is an object, right?"
474,2019-01-31T13:02:34.415800,Carmen,This sounds like a job for some experimentation.
474,2019-01-31T13:04:46.417100,Carmen,"```def some_function():
    pass

479,2019-01-31T14:15:53.429900,Bethany,if it's a class attribute I feel like you shouldn't touch it from an instance like that
479,2019-01-31T14:19:26.430200,Caridad,maybe class attribute is the wrong word
479,2019-01-31T14:19:45.430600,Caridad,i guess why wouldnt someone just always use a property decorator
479,2019-01-31T14:20:29.431500,Caridad,"seems like with the decorator even if you dont need some validation logic or transformation logic, you always get the benefit of adding that later if you wanted to with setters and getters"

479,2019-01-31T14:27:25.433500,Caridad,"i guess the question is more, when do you use property decorators vs `__init__` to set something on a python object"
479,2019-01-31T14:28:44.434700,Caridad,seems like the decorator is necessary if you want to do a more complex calculation on something set within the `__init__` method

479,2019-01-31T14:40:43.436400,Bethany,<@Caridad> property decorators are for when you want to add some logic to `instance.x = 2`
479,2019-01-31T14:41:02.437100,Bethany,and you can define them while still setting them in `__init__`
479,2019-01-31T14:41:10.437300,Bethany,so they're orthogonal in that sense

484,2019-01-31T16:25:40.446500,Lamonica,"Hi, all!
I have three functions, which needed to be executed in series: if first successful then run the second, then the third. Should I use nested if's, or it's better with `if func1 and func2 and func3:` code?"
485,2019-01-31T16:29:31.447800,Clemmie,"Do they throw exceptions if they are not successful? If so you should do
```
try:
   func1()
   func2()
   func3()
except &lt;ThrownExceptions&gt;:
   #error handling
```"
485,2019-01-31T16:30:29.448700,Clemmie,If they return True/False I would wrap them in exception wrappers like so:
485,2019-01-31T16:32:00.450100,Lamonica,"<@Clemmie> well, that looks great! Thanks :) :taco:

Yes, they just return True/False yet, but I rewrite it."
485,2019-01-31T16:32:02.450200,Clemmie,None
485,2019-01-31T16:32:27.450900,Clemmie,"Or change return signatures , sure"
485,2019-01-31T16:36:43.453100,Sasha,I've sometimes used the pattern `okay = func1(); okay = okay and func2();` etc. to use the boolean technique while still keeping each one on a different un-nested line.
485,2019-01-31T16:39:00.454600,Clemmie,"You could also do
```
funcs = [func1, func2, func3]
for func in funcs:
   f = func()
   if not f:
      break
```"
485,2019-01-31T16:40:37.456700,Clemmie,"or even better
```
funcs = [func1, func2, func3]
for func in funcs:
   if not func():
      break
```"
485,2019-01-31T16:41:13.457800,Sasha,Actually does `all()` do the right thing?
485,2019-01-31T16:42:43.460300,Clemmie,"Looks like it will, but not obvious that you can use it for flow control of run subsequent if earlier is True"
485,2019-01-31T16:43:10.461600,Sasha,"Yeah, I don't remember whether it short-circuits or not."
485,2019-01-31T16:43:11.461700,Clemmie,"Though all() does appear to stop flow when it encounters False, so it would work"
485,2019-01-31T16:43:14.462000,Franklin,"<@Clemmie>, I like the latter proposal. If all arguments are identical (or there are no)
And this is a good candidate for a separate function, as for me (similar to `all`)"
485,2019-01-31T16:43:25.462400,Clemmie,at least according to the `equivalent to` section of the docs
485,2019-01-31T16:44:10.463600,Clemmie,<@Franklin> You can even handle non-identical method signatures by having well crafted **kwargs passed
485,2019-01-31T16:44:57.464300,Franklin,"hm, could you give an example please?"
485,2019-01-31T16:47:45.464500,Clemmie,None
485,2019-01-31T16:49:23.465200,Franklin,pretty cool! thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
485,2019-01-31T16:49:39.465600,Clemmie,"Sorry, also need to catch `**kwargs` in the function definitions, editing"
485,2019-01-31T16:49:49.465800,Franklin,I got the idea
485,2019-01-31T16:50:17.466100,Clemmie,:thumbsup:

489,2019-01-31T23:54:31.486000,Marla,"The extra slash is added to escape the slash that you’ve entered. If you loop over each list item and print it, you’ll see that the second slash isn’t really there."

490,2019-02-01T02:01:21.495300,Sasha,"The escaping is perfectly normal. It's just a difference in the `repr()` versus `str()` format of a string. In fact, you should be adding the escapes in your source... the only reason it works now is because `""\*""` is not a defined escape sequence, but if you try the same with `""\rajesh""`, it'll be an error."

491,2019-02-01T03:17:35.498800,Jimmy,then you can remove the spacefrom the first argument
491,2019-02-01T03:17:54.499400,Valeri,Tried
491,2019-02-01T03:17:56.499600,Jimmy,replace just replace the first arg in the target string by the second

491,2019-02-01T03:21:45.502900,Jimmy,if you need to insert stuff between `'` you can replace that with more text that are also between `'`
491,2019-02-01T03:21:59.503000,Zella,<@Valeri> maybe set another variable.

491,2019-02-01T03:25:24.505800,Jimmy,but you could also do something like this if you prefer

494,2019-02-01T07:39:41.525800,Mica,"you'll want to add the `__init__.py` as <@Hiroko> suggested and then do `from .basic import db, Toy, Puppy, Owner`"
494,2019-02-01T07:40:56.526800,Mica,the `.basic` is a relative import vs. an abs import which would be `from rela.basic import ...`
494,2019-02-01T07:41:26.527100,Mica,<https://realpython.com/absolute-vs-relative-python-imports/>
494,2019-02-01T07:48:47.527900,Hiroko,no
494,2019-02-01T07:48:54.528200,Hiroko,it defines a directory as a python package
494,2019-02-01T07:49:07.528500,Hiroko,"FYI, you should be using python 3, if you can"
494,2019-02-01T07:49:31.529200,Hiroko,python 2 is end of life in about 14 months
494,2019-02-01T07:53:39.531600,Hiroko,"you haven’t done anything with python before, have you?"
494,2019-02-01T07:55:25.532700,Hiroko,how so?
494,2019-02-01T07:56:12.535000,Hiroko,and <@Randal> I feel it would be a better approach for you to use a tutorial or python beginners youtube series to get the basics of the language
494,2019-02-01T07:56:38.536200,Randal,"I'm a beginner. I've done a few projects, lots of imports but Its my first time working with flask and SQLalchemy. This is the first time i'm experiencing such issues"
494,2019-02-01T07:57:05.536800,Geneva,"Well, I normally run django (with gunicorn) + celery as supervisor demons to serve my app backend on AWS. but since today, without any code changes the celery just wont start. Tried reinstalling it with pip, but no luck. It gives literally 0 output to console, just hangs after the command execution"
494,2019-02-01T08:01:47.538000,Hiroko,<@Geneva> have you added `DEBUG=True` to your celery config?
494,2019-02-01T08:03:23.539800,Geneva,"yes, I even ran it with `-l debug` as inline option"
494,2019-02-01T08:03:24.539900,Hiroko,or go to debug log mode for your worker?
494,2019-02-01T08:03:27.540100,Randal,"My main issue before the importing problem, was that when the code would run, it ran fine. But it would not create a .db file once I ran the code. Meaning  I cant see it in my left hand tab even though I have used db.create_all()"
494,2019-02-01T08:03:29.540500,Hiroko,and nothing?
494,2019-02-01T08:04:09.541300,Geneva,"nothing, not even message about it starting, but when i intentionally make a typo in app name, it gives me the stack trace, so it shouldn't be a sys issue"
494,2019-02-01T08:06:55.541500,Hiroko,what version celery?
494,2019-02-01T08:09:35.541700,Geneva,latest - 4.2.1
494,2019-02-01T08:10:34.541900,Hiroko,"you’re on AWS, right?"
494,2019-02-01T08:10:45.542400,Geneva,yes
494,2019-02-01T08:10:49.542500,Hiroko,could your workers be rate limited if you’re on burst instances?
494,2019-02-01T08:12:20.543900,Geneva,"Im very new to AWS, (been using IBM cloud until now) . I've just created micro instance where it runs, and based on monitoring for last day, cpu utilization was max at 30% , so I thought this wouldnt be instance issue :confused:"
494,2019-02-01T08:12:34.544500,Hiroko,it very well may be
494,2019-02-01T08:13:16.545500,Hiroko,"but if your on T2 instances, you accrue cpu credits if your instance works under a certain load, and spend cpu credits if it goes above that"
494,2019-02-01T08:13:48.546300,Hiroko,"and with your cpu utilization over the past day, I believe your balance would be spent, which would cap your cpu at 1/10 of normal"
494,2019-02-01T08:14:20.546900,Hiroko,that’s one of the things you have to be aware of when using “burstable” instances
494,2019-02-01T08:14:47.547400,Hiroko,"they’re alot like a sprinter, can go all out over short distanes but would move fairly slowly over a marathon"
494,2019-02-01T08:15:40.547800,Geneva,"But I dont think this looks like what you are describing tbh, but I may be wrong"
494,2019-02-01T08:16:08.548700,Hiroko,"huh, from your description, I’d expect the cpu credits to be much lower"
494,2019-02-01T08:16:10.548900,Hiroko,or to zero
494,2019-02-01T08:17:09.549500,Geneva,"yup, thats why im saying it doesnt look like that"
494,2019-02-01T08:19:02.549900,Hiroko,what OS are you running on?
494,2019-02-01T08:19:28.550300,Hiroko,and when you do `ps aux | grep -i celery` are there any other processes running?
494,2019-02-01T08:21:24.550600,Geneva,"I am using the linux AMI , which is basicaly a RHEL"
494,2019-02-01T08:22:40.551400,Geneva,"and no, when I grep for celery, I only see the command i ran that hangs and the grep itself"
494,2019-02-01T08:24:24.551700,Hiroko,can you show your daemon config?
494,2019-02-01T08:25:03.552200,Hiroko,"you’re using systemd, right?"
494,2019-02-01T08:26:30.552600,Geneva,supervisord
494,2019-02-01T08:28:42.553300,Geneva,"but i canceled the demonization now, killed all processes and tried it by hand, so it shouldnt be demonization issue"
495,2019-02-01T07:47:01.527700,Randal,is adding the __init__ a python 2 thing? I've never had to do that before?
495,2019-02-01T07:52:25.529900,Randal,I am using python 3. Never used pythong 2 before:flushed:
495,2019-02-01T07:52:49.530800,Randal,"so I create a module, name it __init__.py. What goes inside the module?"
495,2019-02-01T07:58:43.536900,Randal,Now its working..?
496,2019-02-01T07:54:27.532500,Geneva,Hi :slightly_smiling_face: Anyone here who ever used celery? I've been experiencing some weird behaviour that isnt described anywhere :confused:
497,2019-02-01T10:28:55.556700,Granville,Does anyone know if setting blank variables in functions would cause cases to fail when I'm passing in actual information during my function calls? I can provide an example if need be.
497,2019-02-01T10:34:02.557700,Clemmie,Please do provide examples. It is not completely obvious what you are asking
497,2019-02-01T10:34:10.557900,Granville,Certainly
497,2019-02-01T10:41:14.558500,Agustina,"you mean something like this?
```
def name(param=''):
  pass
```"
497,2019-02-01T10:42:43.559200,Granville,"So for some reason, when I run this, my output continues to fail on the first case with the function call at the bottom"
497,2019-02-01T10:43:26.559500,Agustina,"I would think a better solution would be:
```
def name(param=None):
  if param == None:
    param = ''
  # Do something else here
```"
497,2019-02-01T10:45:40.560400,Hiroko,"well, an empty string is evaluated to `False"
497,2019-02-01T10:47:41.561100,Agustina,"with this example, you should get back `{'Year': '2012'}`, right?"
497,2019-02-01T10:47:54.561500,Granville,Correct
497,2019-02-01T10:48:01.561800,Agustina,so what are you actually getting?
497,2019-02-01T10:48:11.562200,Ashley,"also, for optional arguments, `None` is recommended instead of a blank string as the default value"
497,2019-02-01T10:48:46.562500,Ashley,"also, it returns `{'Year': '2012', 'code': ''}`"
497,2019-02-01T10:48:50.562700,Granville,"{'Year': '2012', 'code': ''}"
497,2019-02-01T10:49:05.563000,Ashley,the reason being `combined=calyear.update(prgmcode)`
497,2019-02-01T10:49:06.563100,Agustina,"And never use empty objects (i.e. [], {}, etc.) as you won’t get what you expect because they’re passed by reference!"
497,2019-02-01T10:49:42.564200,Ashley,it updates the `calyear` dict to also have the stuff from `prgmcode`
497,2019-02-01T10:50:29.565000,Granville,"<@Ashley> I see that part, but wouldn't the return fail on the first `if` statement and return nothing?"
497,2019-02-01T10:50:46.565100,Ashley,"to put that in other words, they can be mutable types, and the default value is hardcoded by reference, so it's the same `[]` object every time you call that function"
497,2019-02-01T10:50:55.565400,Ashley,nope
497,2019-02-01T10:51:00.565700,Hiroko,"no, because you have an `else`"
497,2019-02-01T10:51:07.566300,Ashley,because `year` isn't Falsey
497,2019-02-01T10:51:08.566400,Hiroko,that’s a catch-all in case all others fail
497,2019-02-01T10:51:12.566600,Granville,"ah, so I have it backwards then"
497,2019-02-01T10:51:29.566900,Ashley,it returns from `elif not code:`
497,2019-02-01T10:51:58.567600,Agustina,he’s saying that the calyear variable content are updated IN PLACE… it doesn’t return a new value like an immutable object does.
497,2019-02-01T10:52:08.567800,Ashley,^
497,2019-02-01T10:52:28.568300,Agustina,"so the `if` conditions are working fine, but the object you’re returning has been changed"
497,2019-02-01T10:53:02.568500,Ashley,"technically, it returns `None` from `update`"
497,2019-02-01T10:53:26.568800,Ashley,because everything returns `None` by default
497,2019-02-01T10:53:39.569100,Ashley,so `combined` is `None`
497,2019-02-01T10:54:10.569700,Agustina,"true, so the value of `combined` is None, but the value of `calyear` has been changed by the update method call.."
497,2019-02-01T10:54:52.570200,Ashley,correct
497,2019-02-01T10:54:56.570400,Agustina,"I missed that when I first read the sample code, good catch <@Ashley>"
497,2019-02-01T10:55:01.570500,Ashley,"sorry, didn't mean to mislead"
497,2019-02-01T10:57:09.571300,Ashley,"also, for styling notes, you should put spaces around the `=` when assigning to a variable, but not when passing or defining keyword arguments to/for a function"
497,2019-02-01T10:58:28.571600,Ashley,<@Granville> is this Python 3?
497,2019-02-01T10:58:37.571800,Granville,<@Ashley> it is
497,2019-02-01T10:58:44.572000,Ashley,"cool, one sec"
497,2019-02-01T10:59:28.572800,Granville,"thanks all. I'll take a look at this a bit further. I've never done something this way, so I may need to go back and do some tweaking until I get things right"
497,2019-02-01T11:01:46.573100,Ashley,<@Granville> here's a fixed up version. Take a look at the `**` operator. You can probably use it to eliminate this function entirely
497,2019-02-01T11:02:39.574000,Ashley,"the `*` and `**` operators are also super handy in general, so you'll benefit from learning them"
497,2019-02-01T11:03:00.574400,Ashley,"forr what to google, you can look for ""packing"" and ""unpacking"""
497,2019-02-01T11:08:18.575000,Granville,"<@Ashley> Thanks! Ah, I was supposed to have a return regardless."
497,2019-02-01T11:10:18.576100,Ashley,"<@Granville> usually if the only thing that would go in your `else` is just a `return`, you don't need the else, and can just put it in normally"
497,2019-02-01T11:10:51.576800,Agustina,except that str(None) is ‘None’ so your variables will ALWAYS be populated.
497,2019-02-01T11:11:18.577100,Ashley,`year` won't be
497,2019-02-01T11:11:26.577400,Ashley,or `code`
497,2019-02-01T11:11:34.577700,Ashley,they'd both still be `None`
497,2019-02-01T11:12:09.578200,Agustina,"ah… sorry, you’re right… I need to stop switching languages and drink more coffee…"
497,2019-02-01T11:14:21.578300,Ashley,"However, you did make me think of a better approach"
497,2019-02-01T11:15:22.578800,Agustina,I like it… easier to read.
497,2019-02-01T11:17:10.579400,Chester,You can also consider to return an empty dictionary instead of `None` if `year` and `code` aren't specified
497,2019-02-01T11:17:40.580400,Chester,"So this snippet is simplified to just
```
def queries(year=None, code=None):
    response = {}
    if year:
        respone[""Year""] = str(year)
    if code:
        respone[""code""] = str(code)
    return response
```"
497,2019-02-01T11:17:40.580500,Ashley,"<@Chester> yeah, that would be better. It's still falsey and has a consistent data type"
497,2019-02-01T11:17:46.580700,Ashley,also less code
497,2019-02-01T11:19:38.582600,Micki,Any help for the state transitions
497,2019-02-01T11:19:44.582700,Chester,"Also raises the question why do you need this as a function :slightly_smiling_face: It's pretty dumb (in its current form) to hide some complexity (there is no complexity in there), you probably won't use it for code reuse"
497,2019-02-01T11:20:53.583400,Agustina,unless this was just an except from a larger function to discuss this piece of the logic
497,2019-02-01T11:22:29.583900,Ashley,"yeah, that's why I was thinking `**` could pretty much nullify the need for the function"
498,2019-02-01T11:55:10.587500,Britt,"Hi all, how could I best iterate through a list of regex's to format a string (when/if it get's to the correct corresponding pattern) and also raise an error if none of the regex patterns match"
498,2019-02-01T11:59:02.587600,Britt,None
498,2019-02-01T12:04:11.587900,Clemmie,<@Britt>
499,2019-02-01T12:10:36.588400,Sasha,"Let's consider the string `""A\nB""`. In memory, this is three bytes: `0x41, 0x0A, 0x42`, or `A`, `linefeed`, `B`. But it would be awkward to have to hit return in the middle of typing it, so Python allows you to type `\n` in your source code instead in order to get that linefeed character. And if you ask for the `repr()` of that string variable, it will back-convert the `0x0A` byte to `""\n""` in printing it out. If you just `print()` the string, though, it'll give you a real linefeed and put the `B` on the following line."
499,2019-02-01T12:13:07.588600,Sasha,"Since Python has those escaping rules involving the backslash, if you want an actual backslash character in your string, you would ordinarily use `""\\""` in your code, which is just one character in memory, and prints out as just `\`. Though again, if you ask for the `repr()` form of the string, Python will back-convert to `""\\""` since `repr()` is supposed to be the source-code form of the string, basically. So if you want a literal `\*`, two characters, you should have `""\\*""` in your source code."
499,2019-02-01T12:14:46.588900,Sasha,"What you have now works only because there is no defined `\*` escape sequence, so Python just says, ""Oh, he probably just meant a literal backslash in this case."" However, when it gives you back the `repr()` form, it gives you the more proper source-code format, `""\\*""`. Got it?"
499,2019-02-01T12:21:01.589200,Granville,thanks all
500,2019-02-01T14:06:40.592800,Gayla,"Hi guys, not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I've been building a pretty simple web app in Flask most of today, it's a weight tracker app. It talks to postgres db and I'm using sqlalchemy. I'm having a massive problem displaying the data in my database back to the user in the web app. I'm planning on working on it most of tomorrow too, but this is a bit of a roadblock at the moment. Is anyone around to potentially lend a helping hand? I know what I want to do, and the code is pretty simple so I'm sure it won't be hard for someone to find the answer quickly."
500,2019-02-01T14:07:56.593200,Hiroko,"you could ask here, and we also have a <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> channel as well"
500,2019-02-01T14:08:08.593500,Hiroko,"is the problem with your db, api or frontend?"
500,2019-02-01T14:16:05.595100,Gayla,"Oh cool, let me get into that channel too. I am struggling with the syntax/code of querying the database to return all the rows in the db. And then I just want to simply display these results in a simple results page for the user. It's 3 columns, Date, Stone, Pounds (it's a weight tracker app)."
500,2019-02-01T14:16:34.595500,Gayla,How do I join the flask channel?
500,2019-02-01T14:17:29.596700,Gayla,"I've got everything set up and working in terms of db connections etc. I just don't know how to query the db, return all results and then display that to the user."
500,2019-02-01T14:20:20.596800,Hiroko,"just click on the highlighted, or go to channels in the sidebar and search for flask"
501,2019-02-01T16:00:34.599400,Darlene,"I'm using a dictionary to store classifiers in memory on an API so I don't need to download and unpickle each classifier on use. This takes up about 1 GB in RAM.
I am hoping to reduce this if possible. Anyone have any ideas?"
501,2019-02-01T16:03:19.600000,Bethany,What kind of classifiers are they?
501,2019-02-01T16:03:35.600200,Bethany,And how many
501,2019-02-01T16:11:07.601000,Darlene,"classifying text, so I have vectorizers and classifiers.. and 12"
501,2019-02-01T16:11:49.601200,Bethany,is the dictionary for the vectorizers loaded into RAM?
501,2019-02-01T16:11:59.601400,Darlene,yes
501,2019-02-01T16:12:44.601600,Bethany,hm
501,2019-02-01T16:12:57.601800,Darlene,"```vectorizers[f] = vectorizer
classifiers[f] = classifier```"
501,2019-02-01T16:13:11.602000,Darlene,for each vectorizer/classifier
501,2019-02-01T16:13:16.602200,Bethany,and you don't reuse vectorizer?
501,2019-02-01T16:13:21.602400,Bethany,across classifiers
501,2019-02-01T16:15:07.602600,Darlene,they are all different unfortunately
501,2019-02-01T16:15:35.602800,Bethany,So it seems like you either need to do something like have a LR
501,2019-02-01T16:15:54.603000,Bethany,have LRU cache for the model objects or separate them out into their own services
501,2019-02-01T16:16:11.603200,Bethany,then only load `n` models at a time
501,2019-02-01T16:20:56.603400,Darlene,"no clue what LRU caching is or LR, I will do some research"
501,2019-02-01T16:21:43.603600,Bethany,"like load it up when it's needed, and keep in RAM until something else is needed"
501,2019-02-01T16:27:43.604200,Darlene,Every classifier is used for each request.. it seems like LRU would be better suited if I was only calling specific classifiers
501,2019-02-01T16:28:04.604400,Bethany,yeah that's True
501,2019-02-01T16:28:25.604600,Bethany,well if you want all the classifiers to fire on each request I don't see too much choice
501,2019-02-01T16:28:32.604800,Darlene,ya. I'm at a loss
501,2019-02-01T16:28:50.605100,Bethany,what libraries did you use to mamke the classifier
501,2019-02-01T16:31:32.605300,Darlene,RandomForrest I believe (is this what you wanted to know)? Or scikit-learn?
501,2019-02-01T16:31:42.605500,Bethany,scikit-learn
501,2019-02-01T16:31:49.605700,Darlene,"I didn't make the classifiers, but I can only assume"
501,2019-02-01T16:32:07.605900,Bethany,how much RAM is due to vectorizers and how much is due to classifiers
501,2019-02-01T16:32:51.606100,Darlene,is there a good way to check this? they are loaded from the same pickled file
501,2019-02-01T16:33:21.606300,Darlene,I come from ruby.. so performance wasn't my forte
501,2019-02-01T16:34:00.606500,Bethany,"try loading the model, then pickling the classifiers and vectorizers independently"
501,2019-02-01T16:34:38.606700,Bethany,Is the problem you don't want to have a server with 1GB sitting around doing nothing?
501,2019-02-01T16:35:10.606900,Darlene,We are running on Heroku.. and 2GB servers start at $250
501,2019-02-01T16:36:09.607200,Bethany,how often is the API called for these models?
501,2019-02-01T16:36:55.607400,Darlene,"a single API call is made at a time one after another, from 2am - 5am I believe.."
501,2019-02-01T16:38:44.607600,Bethany,"are these models `sklearn.pipeline([sklearn.dictVectorizer, sklearn.RandomForestClassifier])`"
501,2019-02-01T16:40:08.607900,Bethany,I can think of two possibilities that are just different approaches - 1) factor out the vectorizers and use only one 2) Reformulate the problem to have 1 classifier with multilable output
501,2019-02-01T16:42:16.608100,Darlene,"1) This may be an option, I am going to bring it up. 2) I've already tried to suggest this, but the classifier performed much worse"
501,2019-02-01T16:43:13.608300,Bethany,The other thing I could possibly think to do is to serve the model as a serverless function (aws lambda). If it's not being constantly invoked could save a lot
501,2019-02-01T16:46:12.608700,Darlene,I appreciate your help
501,2019-02-01T16:46:20.608900,Darlene,I'm going to think over all these suggestions..
501,2019-02-01T16:46:29.609100,Bethany,good luck!
501,2019-02-01T16:46:35.609300,Darlene,"Boss just came in and said team drinks, so I'm gone, thank you again!"
501,2019-02-01T16:46:42.609500,Bethany,damn i want drinks
502,2019-02-01T17:05:15.611400,Zoraida,has anyone had any experience deploying Django to Google Cloud? I'm having trouble figuring out where I should put my MEDIA_ROOT — on a storage container or locally on the Django Docker instance?
503,2019-02-01T17:50:01.613000,Lizbeth,I'm in the sad situation of trying to debug why ```pip install backports.os; python -c 'from backports import os'``` fails on some machines :disappointed:
503,2019-02-01T17:50:57.613700,Lizbeth,"Oddly, it succeeds on those machines if ~/.local contains an old install of backports.os."
503,2019-02-01T17:51:11.614100,Lizbeth,It's like something changed in the ecosystem in the last few days...
503,2019-02-01T17:53:42.614300,Necole,whats the failure message?

503,2019-02-01T18:01:00.615800,Necole,"what happens when you just pip install and dont run the python command, no errors?"
503,2019-02-01T18:01:39.616100,Lizbeth,"right, no errors.  and pip list shows the package happily installed."
503,2019-02-01T18:02:34.616400,Carmen,That sounds like pip isn't installing to the Python you think it is.
503,2019-02-01T18:04:07.617200,Lizbeth,"That's a reasonable guess, but on both systems, it's installing to the same directory: .local/lib/python2.7/site-packages"
503,2019-02-01T18:04:43.617900,Lizbeth,"I used strace on the python command in both bad and good systems, and ran ```diff -u log-min.{bad,good} | grep backport | grep -v ENO```"

505,2019-02-01T18:49:10.625300,Marita,<@Lashawnda> What's your question?
505,2019-02-01T18:49:53.625400,Lashawnda,None
505,2019-02-01T18:50:00.625800,Lashawnda,the page looks like this
505,2019-02-01T18:50:17.626000,Lashawnda,and I want to use the info inside the https page
505,2019-02-01T18:50:34.626200,Lashawnda,"the issue is when I use ```from six.moves.urllib.request import urlopen

505,2019-02-01T18:55:20.628600,Marita,<@Lashawnda> You could use something like BeautifulSoup to parse the output and grab the data you need.

507,2019-02-02T01:09:35.634000,Adolfo,"I am using a context manager for one of my multiprocessor thread-pool computations, i am wondering if there is a better approach than what I am doing in this code snippet here."

507,2019-02-02T01:12:30.634700,Adolfo,"from examples i see being done I mostly see
```
p = ThreadPool(100)
p.map(self.downloadEquityAllData, symbolSet)

507,2019-02-02T01:12:57.635100,Adolfo,but the context manager i believe handles that

508,2019-02-02T01:19:38.635800,Sasha,Could you clarify what multiprocessing library you're using?
508,2019-02-02T01:35:51.636200,Adolfo,`from multiprocessing.pool import ThreadPool`
508,2019-02-02T01:36:15.636400,Adolfo,`multiprocessing`

508,2019-02-02T01:39:49.638300,Adolfo,it runs fine from what i can tell. i also couldn't find anything
508,2019-02-02T01:40:01.638600,Adolfo,but seems to work fine
508,2019-02-02T01:43:23.638700,Sasha,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
508,2019-02-02T01:45:29.639300,Adolfo,"lol
¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
508,2019-02-02T01:46:14.639700,Sasha,Maybe add a unit test in case the undocumented behavior changes...
508,2019-02-02T01:47:17.639900,Adolfo,not a bad idea

508,2019-02-02T08:43:00.660200,Hiroko,so you just want to replace that one word in the file?
508,2019-02-02T08:43:03.660500,Viviana,but i want to change only second line
508,2019-02-02T08:43:05.660600,Hiroko,that’s much trickier
508,2019-02-02T08:43:20.661200,Viviana,yes  <@Hiroko>
508,2019-02-02T08:43:24.661500,Viviana,yes
508,2019-02-02T08:43:51.662000,Hiroko,"so, when you open a file, there’s a “seek” position which is where the read or write starts"
508,2019-02-02T08:44:19.662800,Hiroko,when you open in write mode that seek position is set at the start of the file and overwrites everything after that
508,2019-02-02T08:44:21.663000,Viviana,yes i know that also
508,2019-02-02T08:44:37.663600,Hiroko,"when you open in append, its at the end of the file content, and adds after that point"

508,2019-02-02T08:44:59.664400,Viviana,how to seek to that particular word
508,2019-02-02T08:45:03.664600,Viviana,in a file
508,2019-02-02T08:45:29.664800,Hiroko,have you looked in stack overflow
508,2019-02-02T08:45:36.665100,Hiroko,eg `python replace single line in file`
508,2019-02-02T08:46:23.666400,Viviana,yes i looked it only change s whole file

```
x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

which would print out

```

515,2019-02-02T15:39:13.676600,Bea,Lengthy question to follow...
515,2019-02-02T15:39:14.676800,Bea,"Hey there, I am fairly new to Python, having only written little self contained scripts, importing standard packages. I am trying to create a script that is a little more complex, but I am running into an issue with circular import errors.

My file structure looks like this:
```start.py
content/
    crud.py
    content_object.py
    create.py
    update.py
    delete.py
menu/
    main_menu.py
```
The `start.py` file imports `maim_menu.MainMenu` class. As the name implies, the MainMenu class creates a menu with options like _Create Content_, _Update Content_, _Delete Content_ which load the `content/crud.py` which handles loading the appropriate file; ie `content/create.py`. In the create file there is an option to `Cancel` from which I try to load the `MainMenu` again. However, the _import_ gives me a circular import error. I understand why it happens, I am just unclear on how to _reuse_ previously imported classes. I have found quite a bit of suggestions online, but they are all fairly opaque and they all seem to have sentences like ""Well, you could do this, but..."""
515,2019-02-02T16:00:57.679400,Sasha,"Sorry for the crickets, but as you note it's not a trivial problem. My best suggestion would be if there's some way you could pass in a reference to the `MainMenu` into the `Cancel` function, so it doesn't have to know that it's returning to a `MainMenu` specifically, but just returning to whatever menu object it was originally called from."
515,2019-02-02T16:04:10.680100,Bea,"Hmm...  Yeah, I'll give that a try. Thanks, <@Sasha>"
516,2019-02-02T16:06:00.680200,Caridad,Wondering if anyone can comment on this code snippet. Is there a better way to do what im doing here
516,2019-02-02T16:06:48.681300,Caridad,"essentially when this object is created, i want to validate that the file , passed in as a parameter actually exists"
516,2019-02-02T16:08:09.682600,Caridad,"also the use of `self._file_path` as a private attribute, is it common convention to work with private attributes and the `@property` decorator in this way"
516,2019-02-02T16:11:03.682900,Bernita,if it works it works. what is the question?
516,2019-02-02T16:11:53.683600,Caridad,"just wondering if there is a better way of doing this, maybe something not as verbose, im guessing maybe not"
516,2019-02-02T16:12:30.684100,Caridad,also is it possible to not have the private attribute at all?

In my searching, I also found a slack community ""The Spatial Community"" (my request to join is pending) that I'm also hoping will be able to help.  Otherwise, I'll do what I usually do and just dive head first and hope for the best :slightly_smiling_face:"
517,2019-02-02T17:01:21.692100,Bethany,it's easy to do in Python - there's a relatively low recursion default limit. If you can change that to iterative it's usually preferred. if the algorithm is amenable to memoization you  can decorate with @functools.lru_cache but idk if that would help

519,2019-02-02T20:25:59.700800,Marc,"Ah, so that returns 2 elements in a list and if i wanted to join those again id have to run another join?"
519,2019-02-02T20:28:51.701800,Sasha,"Yeah, the `i` there is a two-element tuple as output by `zip`, so you're string-joining the pairs, but not joining all of the items together."
519,2019-02-02T20:29:21.702000,Marc,okay thanks
519,2019-02-03T00:50:18.704300,Sasha,"I think `replace` returns a modified copy rather than altering a string in place, so you'd want `lines[1] = lines[1].replace(...)`"

there is one file ``` constants ``` in my project folder.

Now when i do relative import in some other file say file 2 ``` from constants import constants(object in constants file) ```
then python throws error ``` ValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package ```.

But if i do relative import as like this ``` from constants import constants as keshav ``` then all works fine.
please help what's wrong going on."
524,2019-02-03T09:19:23.721800,Hiroko,"btw, `from constants import constants(object in constants file) ` is not valid"
524,2019-02-03T09:19:53.722500,Hiroko,"so if you have something inside `constants`, like a class or function, you can do `from constants import SomeClass, some_function`"
524,2019-02-03T09:21:07.723400,Hiroko,"also, you can use `.constants` to denote relative import"
524,2019-02-03T09:21:11.723600,Hiroko,note the period
524,2019-02-03T09:21:28.723800,Carissa,but Constants is a class in Constants file
524,2019-02-03T09:22:15.724700,Carissa,"sorii i don't mention period ```.constants``` , but i was using it"
524,2019-02-03T09:24:50.725300,Hiroko,"so, when you do `import constants`, that means everything inside `constants` is available in that namespace"
524,2019-02-03T09:25:08.725700,Hiroko,"so, `constants.Constant` is usable inside the file you’re importing to"
524,2019-02-03T09:25:55.726700,Hiroko,"but if you want to use just the class, you’d do `from .constants import Constant`, which would say “Hey, go to this file in this same package and get me the class named Constant”"
524,2019-02-03T09:26:12.727100,Hiroko,then you;d use it like `c = Constant(...)`

524,2019-02-03T09:39:12.730800,Hiroko,because that error usually only pops up when you don’t have an `__init__.py` file in the folder

526,2019-02-04T03:43:43.754100,Mica,it has *huge* racial conitations
526,2019-02-04T03:43:45.754200,Brittny,is that why code not working
526,2019-02-04T03:43:46.754400,Brittny,?

526,2019-02-04T03:43:55.754900,Brittny,so what is issue
526,2019-02-04T03:44:08.755500,Mica,the interpreter isn't rejecting your code because of that :stuck_out_tongue:
526,2019-02-04T03:44:09.755600,Malena,You should probably Google it and educate yourselves so you don't offend people accidentally.
526,2019-02-04T03:44:16.755900,Mica,what happens why you run it?
526,2019-02-04T03:44:22.756200,Mica,what error are you getting?
526,2019-02-04T03:44:24.756500,Waldo,WHat is the error when you run the code
526,2019-02-04T03:44:28.757000,Brittny,this what I found on google
526,2019-02-04T03:44:33.757300,Brittny,i dont see how this help me
526,2019-02-04T03:44:41.757700,Malena,I think this is slowly getting worse.

526,2019-02-04T03:44:58.758200,Mica,the `n-word` is a racially derogatory/offence term for a black person

526,2019-02-04T03:46:46.762100,Mica,I'd probably remove the second comment with the word in it too
526,2019-02-04T03:47:10.762400,Mica,thanks!
526,2019-02-04T03:47:34.762900,Jimmy,but on another note it look like we can't disable @ anymore ...
526,2019-02-04T03:47:54.763200,Mica,it's not coming up as an option for me
526,2019-02-04T03:48:08.763900,Mica,"might still work though, just not come up as a suggestion"
526,2019-02-04T03:48:18.764300,Malena,"Oh, same here. Ditto with @ channel."
526,2019-02-04T03:48:24.764500,Jimmy,it's something in the admin pannel but I can't find the option back
526,2019-02-04T03:48:39.765000,Jimmy,and I doubt anyone changed it. So maybe slack removed that feature
526,2019-02-04T03:49:17.765700,Malena,I would guess @ channel would still work too then. If we had a _really_ empty channel we could test it.
526,2019-02-04T03:49:43.766100,Malena,But anyway :taco: for you <@Jimmy>.

529,2019-02-04T08:24:03.808000,Waldo,I do get crashes if the date range is too long and that is where threading may have to come in to play to split the data range i.e. if over 3 months split in to one month per request and thread the requests
529,2019-02-04T08:25:16.808800,Hiroko,"anyway, the simplest way you could do it is with a cronjob and python script"

Out[3]: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]```"
530,2019-02-04T08:00:55.799900,Waldo,Yup
531,2019-02-04T08:13:54.800900,Hiroko,what kind of reporting are you looking for?
531,2019-02-04T08:19:11.801700,Waldo,"There is some reporting within Magento, absolutely"
531,2019-02-04T08:20:55.803700,Hiroko,what output format?
531,2019-02-04T08:21:05.804000,Waldo,Ideally as the scripts are then being run via cronjobs
531,2019-02-04T08:22:16.805500,Waldo,"Effectively it takes the data, converts to JSON, does a load of logic across the report to create dictionaries with all relevant information and then converts those to a dataframe for further analysis &amp; formatting. The end output is then an excel workbook with multiple tabs"
531,2019-02-04T08:24:47.808300,Hiroko,really?  :disappointed:  I didn’t have to worry about that
531,2019-02-04T08:25:42.809400,Hiroko,"the report would execute over a specific interval, say once a day at midnight"
531,2019-02-04T08:26:56.810900,Waldo,So I have already got multiple reports running at their required time intervals however we are re-working how we recognise revenue therefore instead of looking at order tabel look at invoice table and credit table and get the Net for a given day
531,2019-02-04T08:27:39.811800,Waldo,"To add more confusion in the mix the timestamps on the database are UTC, the server is set to UTC and we report on PST timezone (-8 hours)"
531,2019-02-04T08:28:12.812000,Hiroko,oh boy
531,2019-02-04T08:28:23.812400,Hiroko,how much python experience do you have?
531,2019-02-04T08:31:43.812600,Waldo,mmm
531,2019-02-04T08:32:08.813200,Waldo,Couple of years on and off of tinkering and automating tasks
531,2019-02-04T08:32:19.813600,Waldo,Pretty solid understanding of core concepts
531,2019-02-04T08:33:39.813900,Hiroko,alright.  that makes things a little easier
531,2019-02-04T08:33:50.814300,Hiroko,"so, xslxwriter is a great package for writing excel files"
531,2019-02-04T08:34:04.814800,Waldo,oh sorry - my question was not so much about the how
531,2019-02-04T08:34:21.815200,Waldo,more about some of the why with report discrepancies
531,2019-02-04T08:34:53.815700,Waldo,Pandas can handle the excel writing easily with the ExcelWriter
531,2019-02-04T08:35:33.816500,Waldo,Everything is 'working' however when I do a daily breakdown for Jan there is one day that is showing c. 35% less revenue than what Magento is reporting
531,2019-02-04T08:36:24.816900,Waldo,I guess this is more focusing on nuances of Magento data structure
531,2019-02-04T08:36:43.817300,Waldo,Bu the above context also explains the moving parts
531,2019-02-04T08:37:51.817800,Hiroko,makes sense
531,2019-02-04T08:38:05.818100,Hiroko,but the why can be linked tightly with the how
531,2019-02-04T08:39:22.818400,Waldo,"Yeah, appreciate that"
531,2019-02-04T08:39:45.819000,Waldo,I think since sounding it out a little it is a case of printing out line by line what the script is doing and debugging where possible
531,2019-02-04T08:40:41.819900,Waldo,My assumption was there may have been an error with the data it was using to run the analysis (i.e. missing invoices) but they have all been confirmed to be correct
531,2019-02-04T08:40:54.820300,Waldo,so line by line it is and if there is anything more specific I will shout again!
531,2019-02-04T08:41:07.820500,Hiroko,good luck :slightly_smiling_face:
531,2019-02-04T08:41:18.820800,Waldo,haha thanks and appreciate the sound board <@Hiroko>
531,2019-02-04T08:41:53.821000,Hiroko,:rubberduck: :smile:
531,2019-02-04T08:42:13.821300,Waldo,indeed! We all need a rubber duck from time to time
531,2019-02-04T08:42:23.821600,Waldo,Well most of the time for me as working in silo on most of this stuff!!
531,2019-02-04T08:42:42.822200,Hiroko,do you have others in house to bounce ideas off of?
531,2019-02-04T08:43:03.822900,Waldo,nope - startup business right now
531,2019-02-04T08:43:04.823000,Hiroko,"I used to work as the sole dev in a silo on a django project, and it did feel isolating at times, which is why I had to expand online connections"
531,2019-02-04T08:43:33.823700,Waldo,My job is actually operations and a lot of this is automating management reporting so we can focus on decisions not collating data
531,2019-02-04T08:43:46.824200,Hiroko,makes sense
531,2019-02-04T08:43:56.824800,Waldo,hence why I find this group to be an amazing shoulder to cry on!
531,2019-02-04T08:44:14.825300,Hiroko,would integrating something like new relic or datadog be helpful?
531,2019-02-04T08:44:44.826400,Vanita,"my teammate is 99% JS which is heart breaking... ""But it can do that.. no! It can't, not easily"" (recent convo around `return ...` before finishing a function in flask, it just can't happen"
531,2019-02-04T08:46:10.827600,Waldo,I had the joys of working with a front end guy at a hackathon that clearly was not comfortable with nth child selection in CSS so ended up pretty much writing the whole view logic in the function
531,2019-02-04T08:47:38.828000,Hiroko,bet you’re glad you won’t have to worry about maintaining that :smile:
531,2019-02-04T08:49:00.828600,Waldo,I learnt quickly at hackathons no one cares as long as it lasts the demo
531,2019-02-04T08:56:43.829800,Hiroko,"it was originally spawned from a FB hackathon, and stayed pretty much an operational hack throughout all of v15.  16 brought alot of perf improvements in that regard"
531,2019-02-04T09:04:41.831500,Conrad,"&gt;I used to work as the sole dev in a silo on a django project, and it did feel isolating at times, which is why I had to expand online connections
I'm the sole dev right now on a django-backed web product, and it feels isolating, so that's why I've entered this group"
531,2019-02-04T09:04:48.831800,Waldo,Also found my issue - dummy here was not multiplying item cost by qty ordered as assumed each item was a separate entry in an item list for the invoice!
531,2019-02-04T09:05:21.832900,Conrad,"we have hired a dev and he joins month-end, but I wasn't too keen on that guy. the guy we wanted refused the offer at the last stage"
531,2019-02-04T09:05:40.833500,Waldo,Let's hope he is not on this group!
531,2019-02-04T09:05:49.833900,Hiroko,"<@Conrad> oh boy.  fun times.  that’s why I came here, because everyone else in the shop was C#/Sitecore/angular, and I was python/django/react"
531,2019-02-04T09:05:56.834200,Hiroko,so not too much overlap
531,2019-02-04T09:06:27.835000,Conrad,"hahaha well he might be, and it might hurt to read this, but he knows his capability is not the best it could be, which is what I promised to him would increase a lot if he works here in the interview"
531,2019-02-04T09:06:32.835200,Hiroko,"<@Waldo> good job, not bad for early Monday :smile:"
531,2019-02-04T09:06:45.835800,Hiroko,"well, late for you :slightly_smiling_face:  I’m just starting the day"
531,2019-02-04T09:06:55.836100,Vanita,I'm just happy to have folks in EU time that are into Python
531,2019-02-04T09:06:57.836300,Conrad,<@Hiroko> C# is nice. I started out in C# in college and it was my first irc channel
531,2019-02-04T09:07:13.836700,Hiroko,"agreed, I started out in java, so lots of similarities"
531,2019-02-04T09:07:32.837300,Hiroko,but not too much when you’re quite literally 8 years out of date and having to pay for extended support
531,2019-02-04T09:07:51.837700,Hiroko,which was the case with the other team’s sitecore platform
531,2019-02-04T09:07:55.837800,Vanita,there’s no Ireland flag? doh :disappointed:
531,2019-02-04T09:08:01.838000,Vanita,:flag-ie:
531,2019-02-04T09:08:02.838200,Vanita,ah
531,2019-02-04T09:08:05.838500,Waldo,there it is
531,2019-02-04T09:08:33.839000,Conrad,8 years
531,2019-02-04T09:08:36.839300,Vanita,i spent a fair chunk of my twenties hanging out with a guy called Dave Edwards strangely
531,2019-02-04T09:08:37.839500,Conrad,ouch
531,2019-02-04T09:08:59.839700,Waldo,Was he overly dependent on beer in his 20s?
531,2019-02-04T09:09:07.840100,Vanita,"half head Dave. He shaved one side of his head and alternated long sleeve on one side, short on the other and long trousers on one side, shorts on the other"
531,2019-02-04T09:09:17.840400,Vanita,rode a unicycle everywhere
531,2019-02-04T09:09:22.840700,Waldo,haha ok definitely not me!!
531,2019-02-04T09:09:38.841200,Waldo,Got a full head of hair / 100% bald now?
531,2019-02-04T09:09:47.841600,Hiroko,"yeah.  so, if you’re not aware, sitecore is a proprietary cms in c#, costs about 25k or so per seat for the license.  each dev needs a license.  then you need the license for MSSQL, because the free version won’t work well."
531,2019-02-04T09:10:29.842400,Hiroko,"so, that company was three major and however many minor versions out of date when I left, and about four upgrade projects failed miserably"
531,2019-02-04T09:11:03.843100,Hiroko,you know things are interesting when you have highly competent contractors and consultants scratching their heads at how the project is set up
531,2019-02-04T09:16:28.843400,Conrad,nicely escaped
531,2019-02-04T09:30:07.843500,Vanita,haven’t a breeze. Last night I remember talking to him we had buckfast and pints of jaeger and smirnoff ice. I’m sure he’s still around somewhere
532,2019-02-04T08:56:02.829000,Hiroko,which… kinda explains react’s initial SSR :smile:
533,2019-02-04T09:47:24.844200,Kayleen,I'm getting pycurl not installed problem 
533,2019-02-04T09:47:53.844600,Kayleen,In django 
533,2019-02-04T09:49:39.844700,Leana,Knowing how to ask a good question is a highly invaluable skill that will benefit you greatly in any career. <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask> is a good collection of suggestions and strategies to help you structure and phrase your question to make it easier for those here to understand your problem and help you work to a solution.
533,2019-02-04T10:00:41.845700,Waldo,<@Leana> I am a pretty bad offender however someone asked me the other day what I found most useful when learning to code - how to know what you are trying to ask
533,2019-02-04T10:01:17.846200,Hiroko,"knowing how to ask a question, yeah."
533,2019-02-04T10:01:30.846600,Hiroko,sometimes you’re rubber-ducking yourself when you structure a question
533,2019-02-04T10:01:59.846700,Leana,"I don't know, I'm just a bot :robot_face:"
533,2019-02-04T10:07:41.847400,Waldo,haha also should have realised that was a bot :face_with_hand_over_mouth:
533,2019-02-04T10:11:14.847500,Bethany,jupyter displays `self._repr_html_`
533,2019-02-04T10:11:33.847800,Bethany,and I think fill fallback to `__repr__`
533,2019-02-04T12:06:54.852100,Nenita,None
533,2019-02-04T12:07:24.852900,Hiroko,"if there’s a noticeable lag between the read and iter, then that’s the data load time"
533,2019-02-04T12:08:14.853600,Hiroko,"an alternative could be for you to pickle the data, or use <https://www.h5py.org/>"
533,2019-02-04T12:09:27.854300,Nenita,"how would pickling the data make a difference? I've worked with pickle, just not necessarily for that."
533,2019-02-04T12:11:28.855900,Hiroko,"basically, the problem is you’re taking a while to load the data"
533,2019-02-04T12:11:43.856500,Hiroko,"well, more acurately"
533,2019-02-04T12:11:58.857100,Hiroko,"loading the data, and you’re going through 2.7 million lines"
533,2019-02-04T12:12:02.857400,Hiroko,line by line by line
533,2019-02-04T12:13:33.858900,Marth,"dd82 will likely be able to provide better help, but some other (non-python) things to maybe check:
1. I THINK read_csv loads the data into memory.  Maybe check your memory...see if it's paging some of it?
2. Is the source on a spinning drive?
3. Is the paging file on a spinning drive?
4. In the system monitor showing high memory usage?

Of course, if I'm wrong and read_csv doesn't load the data into memory, you can pretty much ignore everything I just said :slightly_smiling_face:"
533,2019-02-04T12:17:20.859700,Hiroko,<@Nenita> <https://medium.com/@jerilkuriakose/using-hdf5-with-python-6c5242d08773>
533,2019-02-04T12:18:04.860500,Nenita,"yea read_csv definitely stores it into memory. mem usage doesn't spike too bad, but any lower end pc may hate having to load that big of a file everytime."
533,2019-02-04T12:26:54.860800,Nenita,trying that atm to see the difference

535,2019-02-04T12:05:31.851900,Nenita,"so this topic/question was covered a few days back, but what would be the fastest method of iterrating through specifically 2,797,165 lines of text? I'm using pd.read_csv and noticed it takes while for that line to execute. So doe's read_csv load/read the entire file before storing the information into any variable?"
536,2019-02-04T12:51:35.861000,Sha,Hy guys
536,2019-02-04T12:52:24.861900,Sha,How can i extract word inside parentheses with expression regular
536,2019-02-04T12:53:30.863500,Sha,"For example to_char(data_cnpj_base), to_char(cnpj_re)"
536,2019-02-04T12:53:51.864100,Sha,I need data_cnpj_base and cnpj_re
536,2019-02-04T12:54:09.864400,Hiroko,what exactly are you trying to do?
536,2019-02-04T12:55:21.865000,Sha,I need extract this words in a text
536,2019-02-04T12:55:52.865600,Sha,I need extract word with contains cnpj
536,2019-02-04T12:55:58.865900,Sha,In a big text
536,2019-02-04T12:56:02.866200,Sha,Understood?
536,2019-02-04T12:56:18.866500,Hiroko,`to_char(...)` reads like a programming language
536,2019-02-04T12:56:24.866800,Sha,Yes
536,2019-02-04T12:56:30.867200,Hiroko,are you building a lexer/parser?
536,2019-02-04T12:56:35.867400,Sha,But in text i have this words
536,2019-02-04T13:17:15.869300,Carissa,"Need one help,
can anyone tell me how to make current working directory as a package, because python doesn't treat current working directory as package. So if run any module in package directory having done relative import in it then it throws error of ``` ValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package ```"
537,2019-02-04T13:18:30.869500,Jettie,`__init__.py` makes a package
537,2019-02-04T13:19:29.870500,Hiroko,what happens when you do absolute import?
537,2019-02-04T13:20:19.871200,Carissa,"thanks <@Jettie>, i know it make package
but i want to say that if i was in package directory and run any module of subpackage having relative import init then it is throwing error"
537,2019-02-04T13:20:51.872000,Jettie,can you show your directory structure (with __init__ files)?
537,2019-02-04T13:21:27.872600,Carissa,"thanks <@Hiroko>, when i was doing absolute import then pylint is recommending for doing relative import"
537,2019-02-04T13:22:15.872700,Carissa,None
537,2019-02-04T13:22:36.873200,Jettie,"and what's the project root, i.e. one directory above?"
537,2019-02-04T13:23:05.873600,Carissa,yes
537,2019-02-04T13:23:57.874900,Jettie,wait.. is it the project root or a module?
537,2019-02-04T13:24:10.875200,Jettie,it should look like this:
537,2019-02-04T13:25:13.876100,Jettie,None
537,2019-02-04T13:25:18.876700,Jettie,"`project_root` is project root, obviously"
537,2019-02-04T13:25:25.877100,Jettie,and `bleep` and `bloop` are modules
537,2019-02-04T13:26:32.877900,Carissa,"sorry, for misunderstanding, the image i send is the project root"
537,2019-02-04T13:26:54.878400,Carissa,and i am treating project root as package
537,2019-02-04T13:28:31.878900,Hiroko,I don’t think that’s a good idea at all
537,2019-02-04T13:28:36.879100,Hiroko,check out <https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/>
537,2019-02-04T13:30:23.879700,Carissa,"thanks <@Hiroko>, i will do some modifications"
537,2019-02-04T14:37:57.881000,Waldo,<@Hiroko> turns out I was unaware of the power of a :taco: earlier! Apologies and hear is a belated taco reward
537,2019-02-04T14:39:23.881400,Hiroko,thanks!
538,2019-02-04T14:39:38.881800,Bethany,<@Nenita> did you profile `data.iterrows():` separately from `read_csv`. Iter rows is notoriously slow
538,2019-02-04T14:40:00.882000,Nenita,yes
538,2019-02-04T14:40:31.882100,Nenita,Exact code
538,2019-02-04T14:40:50.882500,Bethany,where is `data` coming from?
538,2019-02-04T14:42:37.883300,Bethany,like <@Hiroko> suggested you could use something like HDF. It allows for random access IO so you can iterate in parallel
538,2019-02-04T14:43:12.883600,Bethany,combined with `dask.DataFrame` its also convenient
538,2019-02-04T14:46:12.884600,Waldo,I would try as <@Bethany> suggests and stick the csv in to a Pandas DataFrame and see if that works any better
538,2019-02-04T14:46:30.884900,Bethany,that's what he's doing right now

557,2019-02-05T13:33:34.969900,Jonas,"not as advanced, but it suggests refactorings"
557,2019-02-05T13:33:41.970200,Jonas,i.e for-loops to list comprehensions
557,2019-02-05T13:33:44.970300,Hiroko,but not really on par with resharper or java equivalent
557,2019-02-05T13:33:54.970700,Jonas,"yeah, nothing as advanced"
557,2019-02-05T13:34:03.971200,Jonas,but it does come up with some nifty ones
557,2019-02-05T13:34:13.971500,Keva,<@Jonas> - actually python never suggested comprehensions instead of loops
557,2019-02-05T13:34:16.971800,Keva,do i have to turn it on?
557,2019-02-05T13:34:26.972200,Jonas,it depends on the complexity of the loop
557,2019-02-05T13:34:41.972800,Keva,"pycharm, not python"
557,2019-02-05T13:34:48.973000,Jonas,"```a = []
for i in range(10):
    a.append(i+10)``` will trigger the suggestion"
557,2019-02-05T13:35:09.973300,Jonas,but the dynamic nature makes this really hard to do in the general sense.
557,2019-02-05T13:35:14.973600,Jonas,Look for the little yellow lightbulb
557,2019-02-05T13:35:46.974400,Keva,it doesn't suggest anything :confused:
557,2019-02-05T13:36:04.974800,Jonas,"PyCharm also supports some pretty advanced refactoring tools, like moving methods, renaming, inheritance stuff, but it’s never 100% reliable :disappointed:"
557,2019-02-05T13:36:14.974900,Keva,None

559,2019-02-05T15:12:39.983000,Moira,"Given an integer A, you have to find the Ath Perfect Number.

A Perfect Number has the following properties :

It comprises only 6 and 7.
String length in a perfect number is even.
It is a palindrome number.
For example, 66, 77, 667766 are the perfect number, Where 666, 676, 7, 6 are not.
First, four perfect number is:

1.  66

2.  77

3.  6666

4.  6776"

559,2019-02-05T15:13:43.983500,Hiroko,what have you tried so far?
559,2019-02-05T15:14:04.983600,Moira,None
559,2019-02-05T15:18:40.984800,Sasha,"Yeah, that breaks down almost immediately after the first 4 examples. The next one is `7667`, for instance, while your code would say `666666`."
559,2019-02-05T15:20:32.985900,Sasha,So you may want to generate some more examples by hand until you see the pattern.

560,2019-02-05T16:33:15.001500,Karoline,Step through with a debugger I guess. Examine the variables at each step and confirm they are what you expect. 
560,2019-02-05T16:46:56.003600,Carmen,"<@Kristine> What do you mean by ""letter""?"
560,2019-02-05T16:46:58.003700,Tabetha,<@Kristine> Can you better define this? print it how? to the screen? to a printer? What type of thing are you trying to build?

Print to a printer."

560,2019-02-05T16:48:30.005500,Tabetha,"Then you very likely want to make a pixel-perfect PDF. Though, a simple microsoft word mailmerge would be easy"
560,2019-02-05T16:48:59.005900,Karen,"Hello, folks!
I want to scrape some text of some website it has more than 100000 pages, I was wondering, if I should use scrapy, curl, or wget. All  I want is to go around and download all html pages. "

560,2019-02-05T16:50:25.007400,Tabetha,xhtml2pdf is something i've used in the past for something similar to this.
560,2019-02-05T16:50:36.007700,Tabetha,"In the Java world, you'd use iText"
560,2019-02-05T16:50:53.008000,Kristine,"I’ll be sure to check out xhtml2pdf, thanks :slightly_smiling_face:"
560,2019-02-05T16:51:28.008500,Tabetha,reportlab is the thing you'll want. Sending that generated PDF to a physical printer is another thing though.
560,2019-02-05T16:52:00.009000,Nathanial,You could schedule a batch print job at certain times
560,2019-02-05T16:52:35.009600,Tabetha,"If it's linux, just subprocess the `lp` call."
560,2019-02-05T16:52:45.010000,Kristine,"Yeah, I can print things through lp just fine"

560,2019-02-05T16:54:19.011400,Kristine,"I’ll check out reportlab too then, thanks again."
560,2019-02-05T16:54:35.012100,Tabetha,"xhtml2pdf uses reportlab, btw."

560,2019-02-05T16:55:40.014600,Kristine,"I realize that’s not exactly python specific, but I saw Yongbiao do it earlier so I wanted to make sure I knew how for the future."

560,2019-02-05T16:55:52.015300,Javier,Three grave marks
560,2019-02-05T16:56:02.015800,Javier,```
560,2019-02-05T16:56:04.015900,Hiroko,but you can click Snippet or the big plus next to the text box
560,2019-02-05T16:56:05.016000,Kristine,Oh it detects it automatically?
560,2019-02-05T16:56:42.016900,Javier,Yeah just make sure you close with three grave marks
560,2019-02-05T16:56:49.017100,Hiroko,None
560,2019-02-05T16:56:55.017500,Ashley,<@Javier> what's your issue with absolute imports?
560,2019-02-05T16:58:03.020700,Kristine,"Ohhhh, I see it now, haha, I kept looking to the right of the input box for the + sign. I feel super blind. Anyways, thanks, I’ll be sure to use that."
560,2019-02-05T16:58:06.020900,Ashley,<@Tabetha> you'd think they'd have the ```python thing figured out by now
560,2019-02-05T16:58:59.023400,Tabetha,"discord can do it, you'd think slack could too"
560,2019-02-05T16:59:21.024600,Kristine,"As a long time discord user, and first time slack user, there’s a lot of things I’m amazed haven’t been “backported”"
560,2019-02-05T16:59:31.025200,Carmen,"<@Kristine> you've gotten a few other suggestions, based on what you've said here's a bit more:
* If you don't absolutely have to have a PDF copy, if you just need to print the letter you generate, you can use `Secretary` to generate documents from ODT templates, and then automate printing with Open Office via `unotools`"
560,2019-02-05T16:59:57.026100,Javier,"I'm getting `ImportError: No module named useful_functions.sql_server_functions`

My tree is Z:/useful_functions/sql_server_functions

My statement is ```from useful_functions.sql_server_functions import create_connection```"
560,2019-02-05T17:00:13.026900,Kristine,"Interesting, that might be a simpler solution. I’ll make a note of that."
560,2019-02-05T17:00:38.027900,Ashley,<@Javier> do you have an `__init__.py` file in `Z:/useful_functions/`?
560,2019-02-05T17:00:38.028000,Hiroko,"show your file structure, <@Javier>"
560,2019-02-05T17:00:47.028300,Carmen,"Rendering HTML takes a decent bit of effort, but if you don't *have* to render HTML, if you just need to plug in values and the rest of the formatting can come from the ODT template document, that might be easier."
560,2019-02-05T17:01:10.029100,Javier,<@Hiroko> I did?
560,2019-02-05T17:01:31.030100,Kristine,"Yeah, as long as the ODT template can have images in it (which from the time I’ve spent in Open/Libre Office I’m sure it can) then that’s a great solution."
560,2019-02-05T17:01:36.030400,Ashley,<@Javier> they mean a screenshot of all the files and folders inside `Z:/useful_functions/`
560,2019-02-05T17:02:01.032000,Carmen,"Is the image dynamic, or will it be static?"
560,2019-02-05T17:02:04.032300,Ashley,I think they mean*
560,2019-02-05T17:02:06.032400,Javier,"<@Ashley> I do it has `name = ""useful_functions""` in it"
560,2019-02-05T17:02:06.032500,Hiroko,"if you dont have an `__init__.py`, that directory is not a package"
560,2019-02-05T17:02:26.033000,Hiroko,directory/folder != package
560,2019-02-05T17:02:41.033600,Javier,I do have __init__.py
560,2019-02-05T17:02:47.033800,Kristine,"Static image, it’s going to be a couple of things like company logos."
560,2019-02-05T17:02:57.034000,Carmen,Then you should be perfectly fine.
560,2019-02-05T17:03:05.034500,Kristine,:thumbsup:
560,2019-02-05T17:03:12.034800,Carmen,"Though I did just check, and secretary does support placeholder images as well. <https://github.com/christopher-ramirez/secretary#image-support>"
560,2019-02-05T17:03:13.034900,Ashley,<@Javier> where are you running the script from?
560,2019-02-05T17:03:40.035900,Javier,I'm just trying to import in a python terminal in vs code.
560,2019-02-05T17:03:51.036100,Ashley,ah ok
560,2019-02-05T17:04:12.036600,Ashley,"yeah, so basically, the python interpreter you're running has no idea where that package is"
560,2019-02-05T17:04:28.037300,Javier,I tried telling it that it was in Z
560,2019-02-05T17:04:40.037600,Ashley,"IIRC, it looks in the site-packages folder associated with that python binary, or in the current working directory"
560,2019-02-05T17:05:02.038000,Javier,"Yeah, do I need to add to sys.path before I run?"
560,2019-02-05T17:05:51.039300,Ashley,"I would just wrap it all in another folder, and then put a setup.py in the parent folder so you can treat it like an installable repo"
560,2019-02-05T17:06:01.039600,Tabetha,"You can edit sys.path, but it would be better to give that hint as you run the application using the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`. Or ever better, install it locally"
560,2019-02-05T17:06:30.040300,Ashley,"you can look up a super simple setuptools setup.py example to copy and paste, and then just run `python setup.py develop` from that directory"
560,2019-02-05T17:07:21.041500,Javier,I don't know what any of that is
560,2019-02-05T17:07:39.041800,Ashley,"that'l tell that python executable where to look for the files (`python setup.py install` will build a copy to put into your site-packages folder, so it won't see the changes you make. `develop` just points to the original files so it sees the changes you make)"
560,2019-02-05T17:08:01.042000,Ashley,<@Javier> no worries
560,2019-02-05T17:08:05.042200,Ashley,so to recap real quick
560,2019-02-05T17:08:34.042800,Ashley,you can have multiple python executables on a single machine. this is what makes virtual environments feasible
560,2019-02-05T17:09:04.043500,Ashley,every python executable has a location hard-coded into it that points to a specific `site-packages` folder
560,2019-02-05T17:09:39.044200,Ashley,"the `site-packages` folder is where a python executable will look to find all the packages that it has ""installed"""
560,2019-02-05T17:09:52.044500,Ashley,"this is what ""installing a package"" means in the context of python"
560,2019-02-05T17:10:31.045200,Ashley,`setuptools` is a tool package meant to make developing installable python packages easier/consistent
560,2019-02-05T17:11:25.046100,Ashley,"it does this through a `setup.py` file, which, typically, shouldn't be inside your python package itself. Instead, it usually sits in the folder just above it"
560,2019-02-05T17:12:20.046600,Javier,Okay I think I understand now
560,2019-02-05T17:12:24.046800,Ashley,"for example, here's the repo for pytest <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/>"
560,2019-02-05T17:13:01.047500,Ashley,"you can see the `setup.py` file in the root, but the package code itself is actually in a deeper folder"
560,2019-02-05T17:13:29.048500,Javier,My phone is dying I'll have to look at that later.
560,2019-02-05T17:13:33.048700,Ashley,"typically, you'd see the first `__init__.py` somewhere like `&lt;root folder&gt;/src/__init__.py`"
560,2019-02-05T17:13:46.048900,Ashley,no worries
560,2019-02-05T17:14:00.049400,Javier,<@Ashley> :taco: 
560,2019-02-05T17:14:14.049700,Ashley,"check out setuptools and setup.py tutorials, and they will walk you through. It shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to get you up and running"
560,2019-02-05T17:14:26.050000,Javier,I will do that
560,2019-02-05T17:14:58.051200,Javier,I've been struggling with absolute paths for a while. It's so simple and I have absolutely no idea why it isn't working
560,2019-02-05T17:15:13.051500,Ashley,"yeah, you have the right idea"
560,2019-02-05T17:15:25.051900,Ashley,it's just kinda annoying to tell python where to look
560,2019-02-05T17:16:20.053000,Ashley,"unfortunately, you can't tell it where to look directly. instead you have to put files where it's already looking (i.e. `site-packages/`) that point at your code, and setuptools can take care of that for you"
560,2019-02-05T19:12:26.053800,Micki,any body can help with threads and state machine
561,2019-02-05T16:34:03.002000,Kristine,"Hey guys, I’m going to be getting a letter in which I will have to input some information from an API and print regularly. That’s all fine and dandy, but here’s the complicated part, the letter is going to have images in it too, and I’m not sure what the best way to handle this is. My first thought is HTML, do the substitutions, render it, and print it, but then my problem here is I don’t know how to print the HTML rendered as opposed to the raw code. I suppose I could try converting the HTML document to a PDF, or maybe I could try editing a PDF in python somehow, though I’ve never tried that before. Anyone have a suggestion on the best format for me to use for this? The letter isn’t written yet, so I can use pretty much anything. The system I’ll be running this on is Ubuntu Server 18.04.1 LTS if that helps."

It's a basic site and 90% of it can be done with the basic HTML, CSS, JS stack, however it needs a contact form which requires some backend work. I have built some projects in Flask and was wondering if this would be a good chance to use Flask? or is Flask too much for something like this?"

562,2019-02-05T20:07:09.057800,Cammie,Negative. Will look at that rn
563,2019-02-05T19:59:49.057500,Bethany,Have you tried `repr`?
563,2019-02-05T20:14:45.059000,Carmen,"<@Janella> Flask should be fine for a project like this. However, I'm not sure you actually need to have a backend for just a form. Is there sensitive data being submitted? If not, you could easily set up a Google Form that feeds into a Google Sheet or just emails you a copy of the data that was submitted."
563,2019-02-05T20:15:07.059600,Carmen,"As loathe as I am to say this, sometimes Python isn't actually the best tool to use for solving a problem."

564,2019-02-06T00:08:11.065700,Marth,"I'm guessing it is, but the only other thing I'd verify is that the path is correct.  I'd throw a quick print in just prior for a sanity check and to make sure something isn't wonky with a relative path or something?  Sorry I can't be of more help."
564,2019-02-06T00:09:12.066200,Hai,no prbs dan i will add some prints and see . thank dan appreicate it
564,2019-02-06T00:11:06.068000,Marth,:+1:  if you get a new error or have more info share...please do!  I've been starting to work a little bit with pandas...so knowing how/when thing fail and how to troubleshoot them is helpful for me too!
564,2019-02-06T00:11:22.068200,Hai,sure  dan i will
564,2019-02-06T00:13:52.069000,Marth,"also just did a quick google and found this: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24924909/python-pandas-not-recognizing-json-file>

No idea if it's relevant to what you're trying to do."
564,2019-02-06T00:15:38.069200,Malika,"make your file a jinja template, then pandas will recognise it"
565,2019-02-06T02:16:02.070200,Micki,can any one help me with transitions in thread? I see that triggers dont get called from thread
565,2019-02-06T02:18:46.070400,Jonas,"Ask the question you want to ask, don't ask to ask."
565,2019-02-06T02:20:42.070600,Sasha,I know you've been asking about this a lot and not getting any good answers. Maybe it would help if you could reduce your code down to the simplest possible self-contained case which exhibits the problem you're seeing?
565,2019-02-06T02:22:52.070900,Micki,I was giving all the details
565,2019-02-06T02:23:11.071100,Micki,but didnt get response. I am stuck and cant proceed so I am asking
565,2019-02-06T02:23:34.071300,Micki,I gave the state machine and related code
565,2019-02-06T02:24:56.071500,Micki,its very basic issue the sate trigger is not getting called from thread
565,2019-02-06T02:25:51.072500,Micki,"its very basic the state transition triggers are not getting called from thread , before creating thread I see triggers get called"
565,2019-02-06T02:27:49.073300,Micki,the code works in different repo I am porting to containerise it to a different repo
566,2019-02-06T03:15:12.073600,Doretha,"Hello. I'm getting a Traceback (most recent call last):

Exception: Matrix is singular"
566,2019-02-06T03:40:28.074000,Jettie,so what's the problem?
566,2019-02-06T03:40:59.074600,Jettie,it detects a singular matrix
566,2019-02-06T04:46:05.076500,Doretha,"<@Jettie> the given matrix is a tridiagonal matrix, why does it report a singular matrix?"
567,2019-02-06T04:19:56.075100,Karoline,Can you put this in a single file somewhere that someone can download and run? Completely self-contained?
568,2019-02-06T04:54:52.078200,Teodora,"Hi, I have a function that returns a function. We use type hints in our project but I’m not sure what’s the best practice here regarding which type to use in the hint when returning a function. This answer suggests returning a `Callable`: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/39624147> Is that a good solution?"
568,2019-02-06T04:56:27.078600,Mica,the top answer seems like the best
568,2019-02-06T04:57:07.078900,Teodora,"That’s the one I linked, right?"
568,2019-02-06T04:57:13.079200,Mica,yes
568,2019-02-06T04:58:51.079500,Teodora,btw: Do you recommend a linter to enforce type hints when making a PR?
568,2019-02-06T04:59:28.079700,Jettie,mypy!
568,2019-02-06T04:59:29.079900,Mica,I (personally) recommend black as a linter and Mypy for checking type hinting
568,2019-02-06T04:59:58.080400,Jettie,the issue with Callables is that they are not flexible
568,2019-02-06T05:00:19.080900,Jettie,"but there are also Protocols, and I've heard they can be used to define a more strict callable"
568,2019-02-06T05:00:32.081400,Jettie,"like, a callable that accepts a certain keyword argument"
568,2019-02-06T05:01:54.081600,Jettie,"oh yeah!

I have a database with all the contacts (time and cause) that have been made by all th customers of a company.
I'm trying to predict which client is going to contact again.
I would like to use all the information, without grouping and I think tensorflow could be the solution
I've understood that a Tensor is a matrix of matrix. I yhink this little matrix could be all the information I hav of each customer.
Anybody knows if it's possible to do it like this? I've never used it."
570,2019-02-06T05:51:51.087500,Lanny,"is here the best channel for beginner questions? Hope so, I am trying to retrieve the first letter of each word in a sentence with regular expression: `\b[a-zA-Z]\b` e.g. from ""Hi-there"" I want to get ""[H, t]"".
```
p = re.compile(r'\b[a-zA-Z]\b')
p.search('Hi-there') # return None?
```
Why does this not work?"
570,2019-02-06T05:53:56.087600,Teodora,You could also try <#C07EW4DNE|learning_python>
570,2019-02-06T05:54:45.087900,Lanny,ok wasn't sure which channel suits better for beginner level questions
570,2019-02-06T05:54:56.088100,Karoline,here works
570,2019-02-06T05:58:48.089100,Karoline,So I think the issue is you need one or more of the `[a-zA-Z]` so you should change your regex to `\b[a-zA-Z]+\b` and I think it will work for you
570,2019-02-06T05:59:23.089800,Karoline,because what you are searching for is a single letter that is at the beginning and end of a word
570,2019-02-06T06:00:11.090500,Karoline,"Or - I guess the better thing to do is ask what you want to see returned from that, because I suppose there are other ways to interpret what you wanted to match."
570,2019-02-06T06:00:32.090900,Karoline,But my change would match both `Hi` and `there`.
570,2019-02-06T06:05:58.091200,Mica,you could also check out <#CC4NKARK6|regex> for future regex qs :stuck_out_tongue:
570,2019-02-06T06:10:37.095100,Karoline,"You can integrate them all into pytest pretty easily too which is nice, so it runs the type checking and black all in one command with your tests."
570,2019-02-06T06:11:12.095800,Micki,"I have state Machine with transition import Machine, and states are defined. in post_init state I create another thread and rest of the states are triggered through this thread. All this code works in another repo. I am porting it to different repo for containersing  the adapter. But I see that when I trigger from thread it dosent get triggered and state machine seems like have stopped. I tried to log state transitions but dosent seem to print any logs. Any help would be great. I can give all the code I am working on"
570,2019-02-06T06:12:07.096600,Karoline,The only way you are going to get help on this is if you are able to post a complete example somewhere that demonstrates the problem.  It's too generic otherwise.
570,2019-02-06T06:12:50.097000,Micki,I can dump all the code snippte
570,2019-02-06T06:13:03.097400,Micki,Actualy I have done that
570,2019-02-06T06:13:07.097600,Lanny,this is getting better. I also need to match on the first letter in a word that doesn't begin with a letter e.g. _not_ which I want to match on `n`
570,2019-02-06T06:13:08.097800,Karoline,Make a single python file that someone can run to replicate the problem.
570,2019-02-06T06:13:12.097900,Micki,I will do it again
570,2019-02-06T06:13:52.098200,Micki,I am not sure it can be done
570,2019-02-06T06:13:58.098400,Karoline,hmm yeah this might be a job for <#CC4NKARK6|regex> as was mentioned above :joy:
570,2019-02-06T06:14:18.099000,Lanny,sure
570,2019-02-06T06:14:19.099200,Micki,I can give the code but stae machine starts with external event
570,2019-02-06T06:14:25.099400,Micki,command through CLI
570,2019-02-06T06:16:21.100500,Karoline,"can you not simulate the event in the example script?  An important skill in issues like this is trying to break the problem down to the smallest, most self-contained possible example."
570,2019-02-06T06:16:54.101300,Karoline,Removing all the other extraneous bits will help you think about the problem more clearly and allow others you are asking for help to replicate the problem with the confidence they have all the context necessary.
570,2019-02-06T06:17:27.101800,Karoline,People want to help you here but everything you've shared so far doesn't give anyone enough to really do so.
570,2019-02-06T06:17:49.102100,Micki,I tried to give as much as I can
570,2019-02-06T06:18:04.102400,Micki,but I havent received any help
570,2019-02-06T06:18:44.103300,Micki,I am not sure if I can give code which will reproduce problem
570,2019-02-06T06:18:55.103800,Micki,its part of the large code base
570,2019-02-06T06:19:02.104000,Micki,and I am new to python
570,2019-02-06T06:19:33.104800,Micki,its open source anyways
570,2019-02-06T06:19:49.105200,Karoline,"Trying to produce the smallest working example of the problem is a good investment of your time, I promise.  I wouldn't be surprised if in the process you figure out the issue yourself, but even if not it will allow others to help."
570,2019-02-06T06:20:55.105900,Micki,Its just I give command to preprovision device which starts the state machine
570,2019-02-06T06:21:16.106300,Micki,its more about state machine and thread knowledge
570,2019-02-06T06:21:27.106500,Micki,in python
570,2019-02-06T06:21:41.106900,Micki,if some has already worked on it might know
570,2019-02-06T06:22:42.107200,Micki,and its a working code in one repo
570,2019-02-06T06:22:53.107500,Micki,I am moving to another repo
571,2019-02-06T07:00:29.108600,Jonas,You need to dig into why this does not work. We cannot help you as you have not provided a small code sample that shows the issue 
571,2019-02-06T07:00:54.109500,Jonas,"And the issue is not to do with state machines, that's just something composed of something else."
571,2019-02-06T07:01:31.110500,Jonas,You may find the issue you are looking for by creating the smallest possible sample that reproduces the problem 
571,2019-02-06T07:02:02.111300,Jonas,"But you can't just dump a lot of code and say ""it's not working"" and expect anyone to be able to help you, sorry :confused:"
571,2019-02-06T07:02:30.112000,Micki,I gave all the code which was relavent
571,2019-02-06T07:02:33.112200,Jonas,If you're unable to do this then maybe seeking help inside your company is a better way 
571,2019-02-06T07:03:00.113000,Micki,I am tryng to get help within company as well
571,2019-02-06T07:03:15.113800,Jonas,"We generally don't just want relevant code, we want the smallest sample that reproduces your problem."
571,2019-02-06T07:03:26.114300,Jonas,All code is relevant to see extent.
571,2019-02-06T07:03:33.114600,Micki,"I have showed teh state machine, init state and the thread code where exactly the problem is"
571,2019-02-06T07:04:02.115100,Micki,this is actualy working code in open source
571,2019-02-06T07:04:27.116100,Jonas,Then you should have no problems reducing this down into a single file that shows the issue 
571,2019-02-06T07:04:44.116800,Jonas,And in doing so you may well find the root of the problem 
571,2019-02-06T07:04:48.117000,Micki,I also didnt get much information on this when I googled various things
571,2019-02-06T07:04:53.117200,Jonas,However that can be tricky with threads.
571,2019-02-06T07:05:43.117800,Micki,I cant create whole environment in single file to reproduce the problem
571,2019-02-06T07:05:59.118500,Micki,where external events and threads are involved
571,2019-02-06T07:06:10.118800,Micki,and I am new to python
571,2019-02-06T07:06:12.119000,Karoline,"&gt; I also didnt get much information on this when I googled various things
I think this is because you don't know what the problem is precisely, so you don't know the question to ask."
571,2019-02-06T07:06:24.119300,Karoline,It's the same reason nobody is able to help here because it's unclear what the problem is.
571,2019-02-06T07:06:35.119600,Jonas,^
571,2019-02-06T07:07:00.120500,Micki,I have been saying that the stae trigger is not getting called from thread
571,2019-02-06T07:07:02.120700,Karoline,"""It doesn't work"" and then a couple snippets of syntactically correct code isn't enough for anybody to really help."
571,2019-02-06T07:07:06.120900,Micki,that is the problem
571,2019-02-06T07:07:32.122200,Karoline,"Right, but there are parts of the application missing, so it could be anything or anywhere."
571,2019-02-06T07:07:36.122500,Jonas,"Dinesh, as we've said many times that's not enough of a defined problem for anyone to work with "
571,2019-02-06T07:07:46.122900,Jonas,"It's akin to saying ""it is not working"""
571,2019-02-06T07:07:59.123300,Micki,all prior state are getting executed
571,2019-02-06T07:08:15.123900,Jonas,_you_ need to debug into this and _narrow down_ the problem you are facing 
571,2019-02-06T07:08:41.124800,Jonas,"Which is not, and never really was, ""my state machine is not working"""
571,2019-02-06T07:08:45.125000,Micki,thats what I asked I couldnt find info on how to debug other than logs
571,2019-02-06T07:08:59.125500,Jonas,That's a better question to ask
571,2019-02-06T07:09:08.125900,Jonas,I'd debug it by adding prints everywhere initially 
571,2019-02-06T07:09:15.126300,Jonas,"If they don't get printed, then work out why "
571,2019-02-06T07:09:19.126400,Micki,thats what I did
571,2019-02-06T07:09:37.127200,Micki,and realised that from thread state trigger is not getting called
571,2019-02-06T07:09:45.127600,Jonas,"Perhaps the code is not being executed, so the prints are not being called "
571,2019-02-06T07:09:47.127700,Micki,and that is the problem
571,2019-02-06T07:09:57.128400,Jonas,"Ok, so add more prints "
571,2019-02-06T07:10:00.128600,Karoline,have you tried stepping through with a debugger as I suggested?
571,2019-02-06T07:10:15.129400,Jonas,Find out where the trigger should be called and work back from there 
571,2019-02-06T07:10:19.129700,Jonas,Adding prints everywhere.
571,2019-02-06T07:10:22.129800,Micki,that what I have been saying
571,2019-02-06T07:10:45.130600,Micki,I have added prints everywhere
571,2019-02-06T07:10:59.131100,Micki,right before the trigger log gets printed
571,2019-02-06T07:11:09.131400,Micki,its in the code snippte I gave
571,2019-02-06T07:11:42.132200,Micki,<@Karoline> I dont remember you suggested debugger
571,2019-02-06T07:11:43.132300,Jonas,"Ok, so add more prints "
571,2019-02-06T07:11:59.132800,Micki,I have added in every state and thread
571,2019-02-06T07:12:05.133000,Micki,more is where?
571,2019-02-06T07:12:20.133500,Micki,In c code I could use gdb
571,2019-02-06T07:12:55.134300,Jonas,More is wherever you have neglected to add them 
571,2019-02-06T07:13:08.135000,Micki,Ihave done basic debugging and research before coming to this channel for help
571,2019-02-06T07:13:19.135400,Jonas,"Using a debugger is helpful, if you use pycharm there is an amazing one built in "
571,2019-02-06T07:13:37.135900,Jonas,But if you're new to pdb then it might be confusing.
571,2019-02-06T07:13:46.136200,Jonas,If you know the code that should be executed 
571,2019-02-06T07:13:53.136500,Jonas,And you know where it should be called from 
571,2019-02-06T07:14:10.137300,Jonas,Then the code that should call it is not being called. Work out why? Where is that code triggered from?
571,2019-02-06T07:14:19.137800,Micki,yes and I have added logs everywhere I can
571,2019-02-06T07:14:22.137900,Karoline,"there's also pdb, if you are familiar with gdb you will feel right at home"
571,2019-02-06T07:14:52.138800,Karoline,"pdb is built right into python, `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`"
571,2019-02-06T07:14:56.139000,Micki,thats when I realised that trigger is not getting called from thread
571,2019-02-06T07:15:12.139400,Micki,I will try pdb
571,2019-02-06T07:15:42.140000,Micki,I dont know how much more I can isolate the problem
571,2019-02-06T07:17:10.140700,Micki,since this is working codeI was suspecting some environment related issue which I couldnt find
571,2019-02-06T07:17:42.141200,Karoline,it's possible.  drop into a debugger in both at the point behavior diverges and start dumping things to see what's different.
571,2019-02-06T07:18:38.141600,Micki,sure. I will use debugger and see
572,2019-02-06T07:59:52.144800,Gregg,"Ah… speaking of debuggers, can anyone share any thoughts on this situation?
I have a Flask application that uses celery tasks running on a docker-compose environment.
Often, after some period of inactivity, a request that attemps to schedule a new celery task hangs (no exception thrown, just retries forever) and I haven’t managed to attach a debugger to try to explore an understand what’s going on.
Any ideas on how can I approach this?"
572,2019-02-06T08:01:07.146100,Gregg,"I tried reproducing this outside the docker-compose environment, but I get a different behavior (it does crash with an exception)… but it is not exactly as the docker image because of how OSX and homebrew are a pain to install an exact Python version"
572,2019-02-06T08:01:44.146600,Karoline,you can try something like ptvsd
572,2019-02-06T08:02:18.147100,Karoline,but you can also use pdb as you might on the CLI
572,2019-02-06T08:04:09.147800,Hiroko,"not if you’re working in a separate worker, I think."
572,2019-02-06T08:04:53.148700,Hiroko,`CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER` or `TASK_ALWAYS_EAGER` needs to be `True`
572,2019-02-06T08:04:55.148800,Gregg,I am not familiar with ptvsd… it seems I need VS to attach to to it?
572,2019-02-06T08:05:26.149800,Gregg,"Well, the hangup happens when scheduling the task, not on the worker"
572,2019-02-06T08:05:49.150000,Hiroko,are you on heroku?
572,2019-02-06T08:06:09.150600,Hiroko,or some other hosting provider that will pause instances if there’s some inactivity and takes some time to spin back up?
572,2019-02-06T08:06:20.150800,Gregg,"No, it’s a local docker-compose"
572,2019-02-06T08:06:44.150900,Karoline,"I think some other visual debuggers might speak the protocol as well, but yeah it's primarily around visual studio code (which is free)"
572,2019-02-06T08:06:50.151100,Karoline,personally I just use pdb everywhere.
572,2019-02-06T08:07:06.151500,Hiroko,ok.
572,2019-02-06T08:07:11.151700,Hiroko,what broker are you using?
572,2019-02-06T08:07:38.152200,Gregg,rabbitmq
572,2019-02-06T08:07:55.152500,Gregg,I haven’t been able to do this because the process runs inside docker and I can attach my stdin to it… is this something that you know should work?
572,2019-02-06T08:08:20.153200,Gregg,"I too prefer pdb, well… ipdb"
572,2019-02-06T08:08:34.153500,Gregg,But I can’t attach to a running process with pdb (to my knowledge)
572,2019-02-06T08:08:58.154100,Conrad,"does anyone have links to any best practices/examples for modal/overlay design on mobile? i.e. what looks decent and is _usable_
We want to display job descriptions and other assorted long text in the modal when a user opens it."
572,2019-02-06T08:11:17.156100,Conrad,"additionally, the user needs to be able to perform any of these actions -:
• close the modal (can't rely on the cross icon on the top right of the modal)
• indicate their interest in the job (yes/no), which would open the next job in the list in the modal

so the calls to action for these needs to be prominent. wondering what would be best.."
572,2019-02-06T08:11:23.156200,Karoline,you can - run the container without backgrounding it
572,2019-02-06T08:12:05.157000,Hiroko,<@Gregg> nothing in the rabbit logs?
572,2019-02-06T08:12:08.157200,Karoline,either `docker-compose run` it or even `docker-compose up &lt;servicename&gt;` without the `-d` should work I believe.
572,2019-02-06T08:12:21.157700,Karoline,"I do this all the time, so feel free to bug me about particulars until you can get it working."
572,2019-02-06T08:12:36.158200,Hiroko,"how much do you have allocated for your docker environment (CPU and RAM), and how many containers are up?"
572,2019-02-06T08:13:26.159000,Conrad,seems like there's no frontend/ux channel

but since in the docker environment there is a hang and not an exception, it doesn’t feel like the exact same thing….
Which is why I wanted to debug it when it occurs :slightly_smiling_face:"
572,2019-02-06T08:21:01.166400,Hiroko,hmm
572,2019-02-06T08:21:22.166900,Hiroko,"so, do you know how to bring in an external lib into a python docker project?"
572,2019-02-06T08:22:43.167700,Gregg,I can do that since it is my own project and I can change the docker image as needed
572,2019-02-06T08:22:57.168000,Hiroko,"so, you can clone kombu and celery locally"
572,2019-02-06T08:23:11.168400,Hiroko,add the local repo path to your docker web container’s site packages in docker-compose volumes
572,2019-02-06T08:24:02.169400,Hiroko,"so when you open that lib up in an IDE/editor, you can put a pdb breakpoint in celery or kombu"
572,2019-02-06T08:24:13.169700,Hiroko,and the code will hit that breakpoint
572,2019-02-06T08:24:34.170300,Hiroko,"so you dont have to dig in from a breakpoint in your own application code, i’ll let you start inside the lib code"
572,2019-02-06T08:25:37.170800,Gregg,that’s totally doable… but the real problem is that I cannot then attach to the pdb console
572,2019-02-06T08:26:09.171500,Gregg,"nevertheless… by explaining it here and with this conversation, I think I found something useful here <https://stackoverflow.com/a/40449862/227103>"
572,2019-02-06T08:26:16.172000,Karoline,if you `docker-compose run` the container you can attach
572,2019-02-06T08:26:34.172500,Gregg,Which is to set some options on the docker-compose.yaml file so I can do `docker-compose attach web-container-id`
572,2019-02-06T08:26:43.172900,Hiroko,`docker-compose run --rm --service-ports &lt;container-name&gt;`
572,2019-02-06T08:26:46.173000,Karoline,you shouldn't need to do that
572,2019-02-06T08:26:59.173500,Hiroko,the `--service-ports` is the important flag
572,2019-02-06T08:26:59.173600,Gregg,"Ah, ok that’s also interesting"
572,2019-02-06T08:27:34.174000,Gregg,Ok I am going to try that right now !
572,2019-02-06T08:28:36.174600,Hiroko,"remember, `docker-compose up` won’t let you do this.  there’s a ticket for that which was closed"
572,2019-02-06T08:28:37.174800,Hiroko,<https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/4677>
572,2019-02-06T08:29:30.176000,Gregg,":parrot: I managed to hit a breakpoint and get a console!
Thanks <@Hiroko>, you have enabled me to dig further! :smile:"
572,2019-02-06T08:29:33.176100,Karoline,"`--service-ports` shouldn't be necesary, right?"
572,2019-02-06T08:30:02.176500,Karoline,Actually - it's definitely not necessary.  :stuck_out_tongue:
572,2019-02-06T08:31:09.177300,Gregg,"No, it is necessary. Without it, the exposed ports are not open"
572,2019-02-06T08:31:28.178000,Gregg,"But since I enter through a nginx, it does work though"
572,2019-02-06T08:31:59.179200,Gregg,(nginx being another service of my docker-compose)
572,2019-02-06T08:32:10.179500,Karoline,Ah I didn't realize there was a need to access the container in question via some ports as well.
572,2019-02-06T08:33:28.180500,Gregg,"Well, it was not strictly necessary, but since it is a flask application and I can reproduce my problem with some particular request… I did need that"
572,2019-02-06T08:33:43.180900,Gregg,Thanks for the input everyone !
572,2019-02-06T08:33:51.181100,Gregg,no pun intended
572,2019-02-06T08:35:57.181200,Gregg,Thanks a lot
572,2019-02-06T08:37:11.181500,Karoline,lol
572,2019-02-06T08:39:02.181900,Hiroko,its not required if you’re running tests with pytest
572,2019-02-06T08:39:27.182400,Hiroko,so you can do `docker-compose run --rm tests`  but you also need to pass in the flags `-n 0 -s` to have it run single process
572,2019-02-06T08:40:01.183000,Hiroko,"otherwise, youll get lots of BadQuit exceptions in your tests with the inclusiion of `import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()`"
572,2019-02-06T08:53:41.183800,Gregg,Yes I’ve had those kind of problems
572,2019-02-06T10:06:51.187800,Gregg,"<@Hiroko> <@Karoline> I managed to find the source of my endless loop with celery… it was the rpc results backend that fails to connect due to a broken pipe and the fact that the results are retried without a retry policy. That is, they are retried in a infinite loop.
I have no need for the result backend at the moment so I am removing this but I will reconsider if I need that later (or even reconsider a different broker like redis).
Thanks again for the discussion, it let me find this bug that has been annoying me for a while"
572,2019-02-06T10:11:55.188500,Hiroko,"and FYI, using rabbit as a result backend is a very bad idea, would suggest using redis if you need that"
572,2019-02-06T10:12:24.188900,Hiroko,"Its easy to do when you’re in local dev, but rabbit is for messages and queuing, not storing"
573,2019-02-06T09:24:51.184400,Malena,"I've posted a question on <#CEH13CZGS|git> but if anyone here has any bash experience, could you have a look?"
573,2019-02-06T09:25:14.184800,Malena,I think it's a bash thing as much as a git thing.
574,2019-02-06T10:11:39.188100,Hiroko,nice!
575,2019-02-06T11:37:08.190100,Carmen,"Just for further information, when you use Rabbit as a results backend, you only get to access that result once. Since Rabbit is a messaging system, once you've read that message it tosses it."
575,2019-02-06T11:38:19.191500,Carmen,"Which can be somewhat okay in most cases, but if you use anything that needs multiple reads of a result (like chaining a group of tasks), you're going to have your tasks hanging permanently."
575,2019-02-06T12:36:55.192500,Carmen,That's a horrible hack. I love it.
576,2019-02-06T12:33:55.192200,Jettie,"&gt; you only get to access that result once
can't you, like, not ack the message? :troll:"
577,2019-02-06T13:38:00.195800,Javier,Need more help. For some reason I can't call time.strftime() in a format statement in a string in os.path.join. I jeep getting a `type error: 'module' object is not callable` I can call it outside of that just fine

577,2019-02-06T13:52:11.208100,Ashley,instead of `time`
577,2019-02-06T13:52:14.208300,Javier,Why use that here when time.strftime works everywhere else?
577,2019-02-06T13:53:07.208600,Ashley,"because datetime works everywhere else, too?"
577,2019-02-06T13:53:09.208800,Ashley,although
577,2019-02-06T13:53:29.209300,Ashley,"the error you got, i think, is because you're using `time`, and not `time.time`"

577,2019-02-06T13:53:50.210100,Javier,I used time literally right above it
577,2019-02-06T13:53:50.210200,Ashley,I just looked up the namespace
577,2019-02-06T13:54:21.211100,Javier,The print statement works fine and this pattern works in all my other scripts.

577,2019-02-06T13:56:32.212600,Ashley,`os.path` is a module
577,2019-02-06T13:56:34.212800,Javier,That would explain it

582,2019-02-06T19:28:17.228800,Micki,I verified that with logs I get the log I print right after that
582,2019-02-06T19:29:41.229600,Micki,"I get this log <http://self.log.info|self.log.info>('connected to olt', device_id=self.device_id)"
582,2019-02-06T19:30:44.230800,Micki,but right after that go_state_connected() is not getting invoked. state machine should translate it into do_state_connected call
582,2019-02-06T19:31:33.231400,Hiroko,what happens when you put a pdb breakpoint after the log call and step into the next  line?
582,2019-02-06T19:42:17.232500,Sasha,"I just want to point out that you have a very similar log statement right before the `channel_ready_future` too, so you may want to make sure you're not confusing the two log outputs between debug and info."
582,2019-02-06T19:45:28.233200,Sasha,I also don't really understand how the state machine works. Where is `go_state_connected()` defined?
582,2019-02-06T19:46:24.233800,Sasha,Is the `Machine()` initialization creating those additional functions in the outer class?

586,2019-02-06T23:51:05.245400,Carmen,"My opinion is that ultimately, you have to learn by doing. Running through tutorials isn't a bad thing at all, but in my experience every developer I've ever met or seen has learned more from working on projects and figuring things out while doing so than they ever got from an educational course or from tutorials."
586,2019-02-06T23:53:29.245600,Carmen,"Tutorials and courses are good for getting you acquainted with something, be it a language, a library, or a methodology. But once you've gone through one or possibly two of those, you should have the bare minimum necessary to jump into a project of some kind. Pick a need you have and try building a piece of software to scratch that itch. The first half-dozen will suck, and that's fine. The only way to learn what works and what doesn't is by doing, and that absolutely implies that you're going to do things that don't work in the process."

594,2019-02-07T07:04:11.266500,Alvina,ah - I was hoping to see it outside of a class entirely if possible
594,2019-02-07T07:04:24.266900,Alvina,like a new_chunk() function which included what the Wrapper class was doing

598,2019-02-07T09:28:07.272800,Carmen,"<@Francisco> That's an extremely broad and undefined question. However, your general process is going to be, ""Search {social media site} for identifying information, aggregate returned results and manually identify your target's accounts (if any)"". What exactly that looks like will depend on each SM site, and is far too in-depth and extensive for a Slack channel. If you don't have the coding chops to implement the solution yourself, you're going to need to hire someone to help you implement what you're looking for."

600,2019-02-07T11:10:10.276400,Ted,I am trying to get my head around abc. how can I fix this code?
600,2019-02-07T11:14:46.278500,Gemma,"<@Ted> , `Child` is a subclass of `Parent` whose implicit super class is `object`. Instead, make `Parent`'s super class `Classifier`."
600,2019-02-07T11:19:20.280000,Ted,"thanks for this, Im not too sure I get what you mean. are you suggesting to have something like `class Parent(Classifier):`?"
600,2019-02-07T11:20:07.280300,Gemma,"yes, but now I'm confused because you say
`issubclass(Child, Classifier)` is `True`"
600,2019-02-07T11:23:47.280600,Ted,"What i am trying to work out is how to get `Child` to be a inherited from the `Parent`. This is so we get `issubclass(Child, Parent )`. This i think is easy enough. But to spice things up I wanted to have an abc called `Classifier` that views the children of parent as a subclass of itself."
600,2019-02-07T11:24:45.280800,Ted,I think the main issue I am having is the `@abc.abstractproperty` call. It will only see foo if it is defined outside the __init__
600,2019-02-07T11:30:00.281000,Carmen,"It's important to note that if you subclass from a subclass, the final class you declared is still going to detect as a subclass of the original class. i.e. `issubclass` checks the entire ancestry tree to verify if a class is a descendant subclass, not just the immediate parent class."

603,2019-02-07T15:23:30.295500,Genaro,^ looks windows-only though
603,2019-02-07T15:30:40.297200,Ashley,"<@Nenita> technically yes, but it's kinda wonky. You can basically have Python run a C/C++ extension, so you can make a C/C++ extension that takes the assembly from Python,  and handles it there"
603,2019-02-07T15:31:05.297700,Nenita,you said that better than what people were saying on forums
603,2019-02-07T15:31:20.298200,Nenita,"but basically yea, create or get a c ext for python"
603,2019-02-07T15:31:33.298600,Ashley,haha thanks
603,2019-02-07T15:32:41.299900,Ashley,it looks like some people have already made python packages that are bundled with those extensions so you can use them like a utility

605,2019-02-07T16:24:32.303800,Fredric,"I'm getting an error writing the results of json.dumps to a file. Tried a few variations.

but running `unicode(jdata)` results in an error because `write_file` is using `.encode('utf8')`.

I could suggest that the author use the `codec` module"
605,2019-02-07T16:34:08.310300,Fredric,"I don't really understand why one part of the function requires unicode, and the other fails if it receives unicode. do you think the `write_file` method works? maybe the author didn't test when preparing to upgrade to Python 3.5?"

608,2019-02-07T20:22:22.319800,Carmen,"If you're returning it in the response as a string, jQuery should absolutely be treating it as a string in your callback. Can you post the error you're getting and the code in question?"

615,2019-02-08T09:25:05.352300,Bethany,you can check by comparing lookup_dict.values to the class dict

Hi all,
I have a python scripts with functions.
I want to run this python script in jenkins pipeline- Not as a whole script. run this function under step build, run that function under step install, etc... Is it possible? If so, how?

someone told me I can use python fabric for that, cause it can run specific functions.. but fabric as it seems is a different syntax than python.. so I would probably need to convert my script to fabric first, right? is there a simpler way?"
617,2019-02-08T09:53:59.358400,Carmen,"<@Bridget> Fabric is primarily focused around running remote commands on multiple machines via SSH. While you could easily use it's task declaration system to get separate task execution from the commandline, you could get the same sort of effect from just parsing provided parameters, without much additional effort."
617,2019-02-08T09:54:26.359200,Bridget,how so?
617,2019-02-08T09:55:08.360100,Carmen,"Clarifying something you touched on: Fabric is just a Python library with a helper runner script. Everything you do is either a library call, or a decorator."
617,2019-02-08T09:55:43.360600,Carmen,Your actual code to run things is straight up Python.
617,2019-02-08T09:56:09.361200,Carmen,Fabric is purely focused on declaring which things are tasks and what target servers you want to run them against.

617,2019-02-08T10:05:40.365100,Bethany,does dynamo have open/close? It's serverless right
617,2019-02-08T10:13:06.365800,Bridget,"<@Carmen>, looks like I succeeded, with argparse. you meant it, right?"
617,2019-02-08T10:14:30.366800,Carmen,"argparse is fine. You could use sys.argv as well for low-level access, but if argparse works for you, go with that."

631,2019-02-09T05:44:25.410200,Jettie,sounds like a job for `re.split`
631,2019-02-09T05:46:48.410900,Chuck,"Remember that `^` is a meaningful character in regex, so it will need to be escaped `\^`"
631,2019-02-09T05:48:19.411100,Jettie,I think it's not literally `^L`
631,2019-02-09T05:48:25.411400,Jettie,it's probably `\x0C`
631,2019-02-09T05:48:41.411800,Jettie,it's just an invisible character and that's how terminals typically render those

631,2019-02-09T05:54:05.415400,Alise,input_file would be the original file in text format

631,2019-02-09T06:01:51.419000,Chuck,"so, when you perform the `split`, you are basically creating a `list` object called `input_file`."
631,2019-02-09T06:02:23.419700,Chuck,this will contain an element for every section of the text between the characters you provided for the split
631,2019-02-09T06:02:49.420300,Chuck,why you see the whole of your text is because you are then printing the entire variable
631,2019-02-09T06:03:27.421200,Chuck,try something like `print(input_file[0])` or `print(input_file[1])` to see the sub elements of the list

631,2019-02-09T09:02:52.425200,Hiroko,keep a list or tuple of the folders you want to target for image load and compare the current folder location.
632,2019-02-09T08:58:10.424200,Janessa,hello . how can i create a function in python to load images from different folders that i contain in my directory for image recognition?
632,2019-02-09T09:02:03.424400,Hiroko,you can use `os.walk` to traverse the folders
632,2019-02-09T09:03:36.426200,Hiroko,"if its a match, build the absolute path string and append the filenames.  add that to a list"
632,2019-02-09T09:03:52.426600,Hiroko,so you build the list of full paths to the images you want
632,2019-02-09T09:08:04.427300,Janessa,but i have may main folder dataset and inside it there are 5794 folders with many images
632,2019-02-09T09:08:26.427800,Janessa,still it should be done the way you are saying? is any example avaialble?
632,2019-02-09T09:13:09.428500,Hiroko,using os.walk for this is a pretty common and well written about problem that’s easily accessible with a google/bing search
632,2019-02-09T09:13:57.429400,Hiroko,"if its not fast enough for you, there are alternatives you could do, like using os-specific commands like `find` for linux and the like"
632,2019-02-09T09:14:32.429600,Janessa,"for root, dirs, files in os.walk("".""):
    path = root.split(os.sep)
    print((len(path) - 1) * '---', os.path.basename(root))
    for file in files:
        print(len(path) * '---', file)"
632,2019-02-09T09:15:49.430200,Hiroko,that presumes that whatever folder you’re in will be the root of the traversal tree
632,2019-02-09T09:16:05.430600,Hiroko,"so if you do it in your root folder, it’ll go through everything in the hard drive"
632,2019-02-09T09:23:15.430800,Janessa,"vailed_ext = ["".jpg"","".png""]

    for lists in os.listdir(rootDir):
        path = os.path.join(rootDir, lists)

632,2019-02-09T09:24:00.431800,Janessa,but its noot recognizing my root directory which is the main folder dataset where subfolders are located
633,2019-02-09T10:02:28.431900,Janessa,"what about this, seems to be not correct?"
633,2019-02-09T10:16:56.434300,Lawanna,"This might be a bit of a crazy question and not sure if this is possible, but I have a codebase where I am switching logging libraries and also want to maintain consistent logging

- Is there a way to parse the python files in the project to write tests to say things like, `<http://log.info|log.info>()` must have kwargs with keys, or contain value with this dict of these keys, etc."
633,2019-02-09T10:17:57.435100,Chuck,I did not know you could do this: `int_value = int(string_number or 0)`
633,2019-02-09T10:21:17.436200,Chuck,if `string_number` is `None` then `int_value` is set to `0`
633,2019-02-09T12:32:17.439500,Carmen,"The technical term for doing that is ""short-circuiting"". You can do it with both `or` as well as `and`. If the first argument of the `or` evaluates as `True` or the first argument of the `and` evaluates as `False`, the expression will stop evaluating at that point, since it can guarantee that the second half won't change the answer."
634,2019-02-09T12:43:01.440000,Carmen,Wait. Blarg. That was a fail explanation. That's not what's happening there.
634,2019-02-09T12:43:08.440300,Carmen,"Everything I said is true, but it's not what you're seeing there."
634,2019-02-09T13:12:53.441000,Carmen,<@Rubi> Take a look at this StackOverflow answer: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/26066961/>
635,2019-02-09T13:24:55.442900,Deangelo,"Hello, complete newbie here.
What's the best way to build a python microservice with a REST api, without the overhead of a heavy web framework?"
635,2019-02-09T13:32:07.443600,Marita,<@Deangelo> Flask is very popular for microservices.
635,2019-02-09T13:39:51.443900,Deangelo,Thanks <@Marita>
635,2019-02-09T13:40:24.444400,Deangelo,would you say Falcon is in par with Flask? <https://fgimian.github.io/blog/2018/05/17/choosing-a-fast-python-api-framework/>
635,2019-02-09T13:41:19.445700,Marita,"@Simo Never used Falcon. So I’m not sure. Flask is very popular, so you’ll probably have more tutorials available for it."
635,2019-02-09T13:43:52.447700,Deangelo,"cool, I might perhaps also use a swagger code generator to build the api interface dynamically based on api specs"
635,2019-02-09T13:43:57.447900,Carmen,Flask literally took me a single Python script and an HTML template to build a microservice. It's hard to get much simpler and faster than that.
635,2019-02-09T13:45:06.449000,Deangelo,"good to know. by the way, I'm not looking to serve html, just a plain rest interface to do some calcs, call another service and return back numbers"
635,2019-02-09T13:45:51.449500,Deangelo,which is why I don't need all the features of a web framework
635,2019-02-09T13:48:05.449900,Carmen,"Then yeah, you could potentially implement the entire thing in a single Python file."
635,2019-02-09T14:10:22.452400,Hiroko,"<@Deangelo> if you're interested in having async, you can make your own pretty easily with aiohttp or quart "
635,2019-02-09T14:10:38.452800,Hiroko,Quart is basically flask on asyncio 
635,2019-02-09T14:18:49.453900,Deangelo,thanks <@Hiroko> I'm currently looking at integrating a swagger generator and either flask or falcon using the generated client to implement the api endpoints
635,2019-02-09T14:19:38.454300,Hiroko,"reason I pointed out async is you described your desires as

&gt;just a plain rest interface to do some calcs, call another service and return back numbers"
635,2019-02-09T14:19:46.454600,Hiroko,"which, to me, means lots of blocking actions"
635,2019-02-09T14:20:11.455100,Hiroko,"if you’re able to do them concurrently, means better workload overall and more efficiency"
635,2019-02-09T14:22:08.456300,Deangelo,that's a good point. I'm surprised python can do async. does it implement an event loop to achieve this?
635,2019-02-09T14:22:22.456500,Hiroko,yes
635,2019-02-09T14:22:39.457000,Hiroko,"but unlike node, python has multithreading and multiprocessing"
635,2019-02-09T14:22:59.457600,Hiroko,so you can kick off the compute intensive futures to threads and processes to execute
635,2019-02-09T14:23:25.458500,Hiroko,"whereas with node, you’re all single threaded in the event loop, which means if you’re doing compute with IO returns, that’s clogging up the event loop"
635,2019-02-09T14:26:36.459600,Jonas,"Threading can be a bit tricky though, as technically python itself is single threaded "
635,2019-02-09T14:27:08.461200,Hiroko,correct.  but you can also set it up so one asyncio event loop exists per thread
635,2019-02-09T14:27:09.461400,Hiroko,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52298922/how-do-i-set-the-asyncio-event-loop-for-a-thread-in-python/52301233#52301233>
635,2019-02-09T14:27:13.461700,Jonas,"So you need to be somewhat careful about what you offload to a thread, if it calls a C function that doesn't release the GIL then bad things can happen"
635,2019-02-09T14:27:36.462300,Hiroko,:point_up:
635,2019-02-09T14:27:53.462900,Hiroko,"as always, there’s no silver bullet.  there’s always caveats and edge cases"
635,2019-02-09T14:30:00.464300,Deangelo,"so this looks like something you can easily introduce to an existing flask application, or does it have to be setup when creating the project?"
635,2019-02-09T14:31:00.465700,Hiroko,check out <https://github.com/pgjones/quart>
635,2019-02-09T14:31:34.466100,Deangelo,I was just looking there
635,2019-02-09T14:31:47.466700,Jonas,it's not usually something you can just plug into an existing app
635,2019-02-09T14:32:07.467200,Jonas,"you'd need to make big changes to how it works. For example, you can't do `requests.get()` in the service"
635,2019-02-09T14:32:15.467500,Jonas,"if you're interacting with a database, that needs to be changed"
635,2019-02-09T14:32:53.468200,Jonas,"it's well worth it though. 90+% of the time spent in a flask app is just networking stuff: redis, the database, receiving/reading the response"
635,2019-02-09T14:33:39.468600,Deangelo,&gt; It should be possible to migrate to Quart from Flask by a find and replace of flask to quart and then adding async and await keywords. See the docs for full details.
635,2019-02-09T14:34:02.469100,Hiroko,"FWIW, Quart is the Flask API ported to use asyncio and aiohttp"

635,2019-02-09T14:34:44.470200,Hiroko,"so for me, it made more sense to build with aiohttp."
635,2019-02-09T14:35:20.471000,Hiroko,"also, aiohttp is compatible with uwsgi, whereas quart will need to use uvloop, Daphene, or another ASGI compatible server"

635,2019-02-09T14:38:19.473200,Jonas,That flask migration page is really way to short
635,2019-02-09T14:38:56.473900,Jonas,"for a hello-world ""read a response, output a template"" app sure, but for any flask app that does _anything_, it will need more work than is described there"

635,2019-02-09T14:50:48.479900,Karoline,"I have issues with the Flask architecture, but honestly I continue to use it because in the end they aren't that large.  I'd definitely recommend someone new stick to one of the main offerings like Flask or Django, and not use one of the more niche things."

635,2019-02-09T15:00:39.481300,Selene,"Indeed- async for a web server is in my mind a niche thing if you need to handle some specific use cases. Otherwise, use flask."
635,2019-02-09T15:15:14.486300,Sasha,"Maybe `items = open('filename.txt').read().split('\x0C')`. That'll probably give you a blank entry at the start, but easy to deal with."

The central fact of our lives today is the absolute certainty

accomplish those things for us which we could never do by
ourselves.
ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 25

This truly is a fact in my life today, and a real miracle. I
always believed in God, but could never put that belief
meaningfully into my life. Today, because of Alcoholics

Him; I am sober today because of that! Learning to trust
and rely on God was something I could never have done
alone. I now believe in miracles because I am one!

642,2019-02-09T18:07:59.506400,Rubi,thanks <@Carmen>! This SO article seem to be describing solution to a more generic case of building a library with dependencies. In my case I need to create a wheel package in a way that when it's installed on a system with `pip install` it does not try to download anything from the internet
642,2019-02-09T18:08:00.506600,Hiroko,No worries!
642,2019-02-09T18:08:33.507600,Hiroko,"Ive managed to avoid xpath, which is probably both good and bad"
642,2019-02-09T18:12:18.507800,Carmen,"So it's describing the general case, but if you read the attached article, it goes into the reasonings behind it. Ultimately, what you're wanting to do is package everything up so it can be installed without an internet connection. The method that answer describes will do that for you."
642,2019-02-09T18:13:03.508000,Carmen,"You're not going to get a single wheel that has all of the dependencies + your library, but you will get a combined folder that you can transfer over and point pip at to do the install in an offline fashion."

642,2019-02-09T18:18:53.508400,Rubi,"to me the biggest issue is that wheels are just an archive, and there is no way to add pre-install logic, because `pip install &lt;library.whl&gt;` simply extracts all contents of an archive.

Let’s say I have a string that looks like this:

```""{'apple': 1, 'orange': 2}""```

How can I determine if this is a valid json object? json.loads() doesn’t work because the string uses single quotes instead of double. Replacing all single quotes with doubles quotes seems risky in the off chance a single quote is escaped, like this:

```""{'sentence':'let\'s solve the issue'}""```
Replace all single quotes with double quotes makes the sentence: let”s solve the issue, which is not correct.

653,2019-02-10T14:23:48.550200,Sasha,"It's more like Python is helpfully telling you ""hey, you can't see the line break in this string, so I'm going to show you it as `\n` instead so you know it's there"" when giving you debugging output."
653,2019-02-10T14:25:45.550800,Sasha,Same as putting quotes around strings which aren't really there in the data.
653,2019-02-10T14:33:30.553400,Sasha,"Short answer is that it's just debugging output, not ""real"" output as when a program runs normally."
654,2019-02-10T14:31:52.552000,Jamey,Hi. I'm trying to decide between using `django-registration`: <https://django-registration.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/quickstart.html> and using the Sign Up with Confirmation e-mail method in this article: <https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2017/02/18/how-to-create-user-sign-up-view.html>? I'm leaning towards the latter because it is simpler and will be easier to extend for my use case since I'm using a custom model based on `AbstractBaseUser` and `django-registration` seems like it will give me a harder time to implement for my use case.
654,2019-02-10T17:28:28.555000,Carmen,"<@Aimee> Yes, you can use jinja2 as the templating engine for Django. That's an separate issue from what your stated issue is, however. If you want a loading screen, you'll need to quickly serve-up the loading screen, and then use something like AJAX or Websockets to asynchronously load the actual content from the server."

The problem is that I can’t install RethinkDB on RaspberryPi and need a similarly flexible alternative of RethinkDB, currently I’m trying to turn my Code to CouchDB, however, I can’t find it as good as RethinkDB.
Also, if I can get any method of successfully install RethinkDB on Raspbian then I can make that installation permanent and can copy the image of that SD card on raspberry pi.

So, I need a way to install Rethinkdb on raspbian, since I’ve tried every way on the internet or a similar DB system other than CouchDB.

Thank you"

I want to catch a succesful Termination of my qt-app
i'm trying to figure out, how i can test the exitcode (should be 0)

that's what i've tried so far:
```
    try:
        sys.exit(app.exec_())
    except SystemExit as exitcode:
        if exitcode is SystemExit(0):  # catches exitcode 0 (=success)
            pass # 'Successful Termination'
        else:
            raise
```
I don't know what to evaluate instead of SystemExit(0) so that the if-statement gets True. Any suggestions?"

658,2019-02-11T04:34:01.030200,Mica,<@Stacia> the issue is this line `elif (13 &lt;= self.age) and (self.age &lt; 18):`

658,2019-02-11T04:35:45.031100,Mica,though you don't need `(13 &lt;= self.age)`
658,2019-02-11T04:35:52.031400,Mica,that's already assumed by the first `if`

658,2019-02-11T04:44:14.035200,Mica,what's the difference?
658,2019-02-11T05:05:06.037300,Stacia,"the outputs are similar. i get the expected output, but for some reason only #2 passes the test cases given to me.

658,2019-02-11T05:47:37.044400,Jimmy,"so why not something like
```
exit_code = app.exec_()
if exit_code != 0:
  # stuff

658,2019-02-11T05:51:02.045400,Shawana,with the nested sys.exit(app.exec_()) I get the SystemExit-Instance directly
658,2019-02-11T05:51:54.045900,Shawana,is there any disadvantage of the try: except_ wrapper i forgot to think about?

658,2019-02-11T05:53:19.047500,Karoline,As a general style thing too flow control via exception handling is avoided if possible.
658,2019-02-11T05:55:12.048400,Shawana,how would you suggest temrinating any application using sys.exit(0)  - this throws an exception all the time
658,2019-02-11T05:57:56.048700,Karoline,it shouldn't throw an exception - what's the exception?
658,2019-02-11T05:58:31.049300,Karoline,you also don't need to explicitly call `sys.exit(0)` it's the default

At my current job (which is annoying me - but will save that conversation for job advice channel :wink:), we are building automation robots that perform desktop tasks which we originally used a tool called UiPath, but now we have been told we cannot use it and have to use their internal tool, which is not good. So my thoughts were I could use python, maybe make use of selenium. But will it be able to handle all scenarios? For example. I need to open a windows application login into and perform some tasks that the program does. The program itself is built with Java selectors. Is selenium the best tool for this?

app.exec_() is required for running the QT-App and returning the exit_code when closed, so far expected
when calling sys.exit on it, it should close without exception as expected too.. but vscode debugger also tracks ""uncaught exceptions"", that's where the debugger throws it out"

664,2019-02-11T11:41:31.081000,Arturo,"cool thanks, will check it out <@Carmen>"
664,2019-02-11T11:53:07.082400,Francie,"Thanks for responses.  I'm confined to using conda build as we have standarized on using anaconda for managing our in-house packages.  It solves a variety of virtual env and package compatibility problems.

One other thing I've noticed in looking at other's conda recipes is that they use a file URL.  I might have to resort to checking out the code into a temp directory first.  Seems counter-intuitive."
664,2019-02-11T11:55:35.083800,Nola,"I'm trying to create a loop that looks for a text, and if found append to a new column, I'm struggling with it."
664,2019-02-11T11:57:26.085200,Clemmie,<@Nola> you are missing a `)` at the end of `if row['final_desc_2']).str.contains(row_1['sequence']`
664,2019-02-11T12:14:34.091600,Jonas,"While conda does help with virtualenv issues (which by themselves are not that tricky) I found the lack of a lockfile does nothing to help with compatibility issues and is pretty much the same as `pip` and a `requirements.txt`. Unless you're distributing native extensions conda/conda-build is really overkill.

Anyway, good luck!"
665,2019-02-11T11:58:07.085900,Clemmie,Also have an extra one misplaced in the same statement `row['final_desc_2'])` the `)` shouldn’t be there
665,2019-02-11T11:59:20.086000,Nola,<@Clemmie> sorry i altered the code before dropping to help better understand the need. this was the previous code and error
665,2019-02-11T11:59:53.086800,Hiroko,`row['final_desc_2']` is apparently returning `None`
665,2019-02-11T12:00:41.087600,Clemmie,"Well there you are calling `.str` on a print statement which won’t work. That is because you still have an `)` in the wrong place - before `.str`, should be at the end"
665,2019-02-11T12:01:06.088100,Clemmie,<@Hiroko> it is the `print` returning None -
665,2019-02-11T12:01:31.088800,Hiroko,"yeah, you’re still missing the closing parens for the `print` call"
665,2019-02-11T12:01:58.089100,Hiroko,"oh, right"
665,2019-02-11T12:02:05.089400,Hiroko,`print(...).str(..)`
665,2019-02-11T12:02:09.089600,Hiroko,"yeah, good catch"
665,2019-02-11T12:02:33.090000,Hiroko,<@Nola> would suggest you use an editor with bracket matching enabled
665,2019-02-11T12:02:57.090800,Hiroko,so you can see where a particular bracket/etc matches up in the block you’re in
665,2019-02-11T12:13:44.091400,Jonas,"Fair enough, that's unlucky. Just to note, you can install wheel files through Conda, conda and conda build are separate things"
666,2019-02-11T12:32:00.095500,Philip,"Hi all, I'm currently testing out an api on postman wherein the json body is pass to `xdata` via form-data. Now I usually handle `application/json` so I have no idea how to replicate this. Upon clicking code in postman for python, this is what it tells me to do.

```
import requests

url = ""<http://v2.xend.com.ph/rates/calculate>""

payload = ""------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\""xdata\""\r\n\r\n{\""destination\"": 1, \""package_type\"": \""UX\"", \""pickup\"": 1}\r\n------WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW--""
headers = {
    'content-type': ""multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary7MA4YWxkTrZu0gW"",
    'cache-control': ""no-cache"",
    'Postman-Token': ""28bc5105-5d63-4fd1-8f4f-e6add99c02b5""
    }

response = requests.request(""POST"", url, data=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)
```

What I tried so far:
```
data = {'xdata': args} 
response = <http://requests.post|requests.post>(url, params=data)
```

and

```
data = {'xdata': json.dumps(args)}
response = <http://requests.post|requests.post>(url, params=data)
```

Both of which fails because the api does not recognize the `params` sent"
666,2019-02-11T12:32:51.096000,Philip,"The json body I'm testing out:
`{""destination"": 1,  ""package_type"": ""OP"",  ""pickup"": 2} `"
666,2019-02-11T12:34:57.096800,Philip,"I know I can simply manipulate the payload from postman's generated code, but I would like to understand how to handle `form-data` in requests in general."
666,2019-02-11T12:40:27.096900,Nola,"ok i will look that up, see how to use it"
666,2019-02-11T12:45:58.097700,Philip,"Welp, this worked
```
files = {'xdata': (None, json.dumps(args))}
response = <http://requests.post|requests.post>(url, files=files)
```
TIL how to send a “multipart/form-data” with requests in python"
666,2019-02-11T12:52:46.097900,Carmen,Requests is a lovely library.
666,2019-02-11T12:53:17.098900,Carmen,It's my go-to for HTTP automation. I only branch out when I need something specific like UI interaction.
666,2019-02-11T12:54:23.099600,Philip,"For the record, what would the best practice for an api payload be? `application/json` or `multipart/form-data`?"
666,2019-02-11T12:55:38.100900,Philip,"I normally expect my requests in a form of json, thus me having no knowledge of `multipart/form-data` up till now."
666,2019-02-11T12:56:32.102100,Jettie,application/json out of those two
666,2019-02-11T12:56:44.102700,Jettie,"multipart/* is browser-centric, imo"
666,2019-02-11T12:56:54.103200,Carmen,"100% depends on the API. If it's intended to be a JSON API, you send `application/json`. If it's something that nominally accepts POSTs from forms, `multipart/form-data`. Normally an actual API will prefer the former."
666,2019-02-11T12:57:14.103700,Carmen,The latter tends to be for endpoints that accept form posts directly.
666,2019-02-11T12:58:33.104700,Philip,"I see, thanks for the tip <@Jettie> <@Carmen> :taco: :taco:"
666,2019-02-11T12:59:07.105500,Philip,"The api response is kinda weird as well tbh

666,2019-02-11T12:59:48.106600,Carmen,That's...not really weird. That just means they didn't set up error logging appropriately.
666,2019-02-11T13:00:09.107300,Carmen,"Which, unfortunately, is not weird at all for PHP sites."
666,2019-02-11T13:00:16.107600,Philip,"Oh sorry, I may have used a wrong term. :slightly_smiling_face:"
666,2019-02-11T13:00:23.107800,Jettie,not weird? it's not valid JSON anymore :p

666,2019-02-11T13:00:51.108800,Philip,Which is kinda sad tbh

666,2019-02-11T13:01:24.109600,Philip,"Tried reaching out to them, it appears they have a lot more issue at hand aside from their api. :confused:"

667,2019-02-11T13:09:22.113300,Angele,"Hi, I have a function f1 that takes as input another function f2 and returns an value. f1 is called on a series of inputs (lambda invocation). Is there a way to pass an argument to f2, and an additional return value from f2 back to the root that then modifies the next input to f2 and so on..?"
667,2019-02-11T13:10:50.114900,Angele,"To phrase it another way: Is it possible to process values based on previous frames in Python's MoviePy library? Specifically, the VideoFileClip.fl_image() function?"
667,2019-02-11T13:11:28.115400,Carmen,You're describing the `reduce` pattern.
667,2019-02-11T13:12:46.116600,Carmen,"Are you sending the `f1` input into `f2`, or just calling `f2` as part of processing the input for `f1`, and its parameters are completely separate?"
667,2019-02-11T13:13:12.116800,Angele,The latter
667,2019-02-11T13:21:48.120600,Carmen,"Do you have a complete list of the inputs you're applying the function to, or is it something that happens inside the MoviePy library code, and thus you can only provide a lambda that they're invoking?"
667,2019-02-11T13:24:42.121900,Angele,I have a complete list of the inputs (all frames in the video clip) in advance. But based on each frame's processing in f2 (my own user defined function) I want to modify the input to the subsequent call to f2 (which processes the next frame)
667,2019-02-11T13:26:56.123400,Carmen,"That's good. I'd recommend you write a third function `f3` that takes the function `f2` and your frame list as parameters, then loops through the inputs, applying `f1` and storing the output of `f1` (which should include whatever `f2` is returning) for providing to the next loop."
667,2019-02-11T13:28:30.124400,Carmen,"In rough form:
```def f3(f2, frame_list):
    f2_param = None
    return_list = []
    for frame in frame_list:
        (other_output, f2_param) = f1(f2, frame, f2_param)

667,2019-02-11T13:30:35.125400,Angele,Hmm....ok let me give it a shot! Really appreciate your help <@Carmen>!

667,2019-02-11T13:31:24.126100,Angele,Will do. Thanks again :slightly_smiling_face:
667,2019-02-11T13:32:56.126200,Nola,"so I think I got it. Now to get ""y"" into my a new column in my df4['reason_code] is where I'm stuck?"
667,2019-02-11T13:39:14.126700,Clemmie,You haven’t written `y` to anything
667,2019-02-11T13:46:03.126900,Nola,"yeah, thats were I am stuck . I tried df4.loc[index,""reason_code""] =y then removed"
667,2019-02-11T13:46:28.127200,Nola,does that make sense
667,2019-02-11T13:53:57.127900,Sherman,Does urllib.request retry by default on 500+ errors?
667,2019-02-11T14:11:07.129400,Angele,"<@Carmen> I'm facing another problem: f1 does not take more arguments. So this returns an error: `(other_output, f2_param) = f1(f2, frame, f2_param)`"
667,2019-02-11T14:15:39.130900,Marth,"<@Nola> If it's not private data, can you share the `head()` of your dataframes (or more if necessary) and what you'd like the end result to be?"
667,2019-02-11T14:22:10.133200,Carmen,"<@Angele> Can you provide a link to the documentation for whatever `f1` and `f2` are, so I can see their signatures? We're bumping into the limits of what I can help with without more information. I assumed you had more control over the function signatures; since that's not the case, I need more information."
667,2019-02-11T14:29:52.138300,Angele,"<@Carmen> Sure, here's the documentation for f1: <https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/ref/VideoClip/VideoClip.html?highlight=fl_image#moviepy.video.compositing.CompositeVideoClip.CompositeVideoClip.fl_image>"

669,2019-02-11T14:23:01.133700,Marc,it works
669,2019-02-11T14:23:55.133900,Marc,but maybe there is a more efficient way?
669,2019-02-11T14:27:44.135900,Clemmie,<@Marc> Yeah - set the nums as keys in a dict and the index as the value. The  avg key lookup is 0(1). For each key (sorted) `try: return my_dict[9-num] except KeyError: pass`
669,2019-02-11T14:28:20.136700,Clemmie,If your keys are sorted you also only need to go up to the key target/2
669,2019-02-11T14:29:13.137200,Marc,hm ok
669,2019-02-11T14:29:14.137400,Marc,i will try
669,2019-02-11T14:30:06.138600,Angele,f2 is a user-defined function so that's not a problem
670,2019-02-11T14:49:31.139600,Nola,"<@Marth> the end result would be for me to put the ""last_index"" value into the df4.loc[index,""reason_code""] so it aligns with the appropriate index value"
670,2019-02-11T14:50:33.140600,Nola,"ValueError: Incompatible indexer with Series, this is the error im getting but the index will never match from ""last_index"" because its the actual value in the loop thats found."
670,2019-02-11T14:53:37.140900,Nola,Does that make sense?
670,2019-02-11T14:54:34.142100,Nola,Oh. im sorry after reading it again i see what you did
670,2019-02-11T14:56:28.144200,Carmen,"<@Angele> So what you'll want to do is be constructing a function that uses `f2` on the fly in `f3`.
```
def f3(f2, frame_list):
    f2_param = None
    return_list = []
    for frame in frame_list:
        new_f2 = lambda img: f2(img, f2_param)
        (other_output, f2_param) = fl_image(new_f2, frame)
       return_list.append(other_output)
    return return_list
```"
670,2019-02-11T14:58:45.145400,Carmen,"I realize that's not precisely how the library gets used, but it's close enough that you should be able to modify it appropriately."
670,2019-02-11T15:14:41.149800,Marth,"<@Nola> honestly, not really.  I say the following not really knowing your data, so I could be wrong....but my thinking is that you *might* not need the ""if"" portion of your loop.  Dataframes can return a series of True or False and act accordingly.  Or, depending on your dataframes, you could try merge/join/concatenate.  Depends a bit on your data (and dataframes)"

676,2019-02-11T19:03:23.171800,Joette,"""polluting the scope"" seems really abstract, but when you're trying to figure out whether a named object (class, function, variable) is used somewhere or not, and whether there are conflicts, it's a real PITA"

681,2019-02-12T05:52:10.202200,Philip,"Hi all, sorry for the intrusion. I'm kinda stuck with the usage of hmac in headers. (image from postman headers)

signature is derived as per the pre-request script as follow:
```
let signature = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(`${time.toString()}\r\nPOST\r\n/v2/quotations\r\n\r\n${body}`, environment['secret']);
```
I think the code below does the trick (haven't tested it yet cuz I lack the header)
```
apikey = '5b8b9ee8167b41958a0bd77f68eaf404'
nonce = 1549605063395 # Copied from postman should be datetime.today().strftime('%Y%m%d%H%M%S%f') but pretty sure I gotta change this
body = {""kindalong"": ""sothiswilldo""}
message = '{}\r\nPOST\r\n/v2/quotations\r\n\r\n{}'.format(nonce, json.dumps(body))
signature = hmac.new(bytes(apikey , 'latin-1'), msg = bytes(message , 'latin-1'), digestmod = hashlib.sha256).hexdigest().upper()
```

Upon reviewing the postman request, here is what `Authorization` looks like in the header
```
Authorization:""hmac 5b8b9ee8167b41958a0bd77f68eaf404:1549605063395:6090f62eece9bf1254c2c2b837ce85cef0fa2e07e6265cac936c64488fd27f83""

Any tips or docs would definitely help :slightly_smiling_face:"
681,2019-02-12T05:57:05.205900,Philip,Thanks <@Jimmy>! :taco: I thought the `hmac` value on the headers was something special. I'll try doing a request first using the signature generated and constructing the header value for `Authorization` as a string.

686,2019-02-12T11:10:35.240800,Jeanetta,I was wondering if anyone is familiar with both matlab and numpy
686,2019-02-12T11:10:47.241200,Jeanetta,I have some questions about porting matlab code to python

687,2019-02-12T12:07:31.244600,Chet,"I have a product which runs on R and php, is it possible to migrate from R to php?"
687,2019-02-12T12:08:22.245300,Clemmie,"A python slack is slightly odd place to ask that, but sure. You can migrate code from any turing complete language to any other, by definition."
687,2019-02-12T12:08:40.245800,Clemmie,"If what you are asking for is an automated migration, well, that is unlikely"
687,2019-02-12T12:09:35.246600,Clemmie,Also chances are R is doing numerical/statistical work. R is better suited syntactically for that than php\
687,2019-02-12T12:10:42.247300,Chet,okay. so we are saying that R is more suitable than python.. are we?
687,2019-02-12T12:11:05.247700,Clemmie,Not necessarily. Python is also excellent for numerical work
687,2019-02-12T12:11:18.248000,Clemmie,you asked about php
687,2019-02-12T12:11:44.248600,Chet,then what is R better suited for? php I am using in backend
687,2019-02-12T12:12:14.249200,Clemmie,R is well suited for numerical/statistical work. So is Python. So is Matlab and others
687,2019-02-12T12:12:27.249600,Clemmie,Different strokes for different folks
687,2019-02-12T12:14:56.251700,Chet,"okay understood. But I have experienced that python processes faster than R. So if I want to make use of python instead of R, then from where do I start, can you help me with some resources?"

690,2019-02-12T13:58:33.274900,Clemmie,<@Britt>
690,2019-02-12T13:59:39.275700,Clemmie,That takes advantage of slicing (splitting a list into smaller list by index)
690,2019-02-12T14:00:43.275900,Deangelo,oh great
690,2019-02-12T14:01:31.276800,Deangelo,"I was just reading about the concept of Split, apply(sum) in Pandas. Do you think that's overkill for this task?"
690,2019-02-12T14:02:19.277800,Clemmie,"yes, unless you have a huge number of months. Especially if you don’t need Pandas for anything else, installing and importing it just for this taks is huge overkill"
690,2019-02-12T14:02:45.278300,Clemmie,"And for huge number of months, I mean all the months in recorded human history kind of numbers"
690,2019-02-12T14:03:09.278600,Deangelo,"lol, not that much"
690,2019-02-12T14:04:33.280100,Deangelo,"but this is eventually for a reporting service that will process data for up to 30 years  in months, with lots of month to year conversions and the other way around"
690,2019-02-12T14:06:15.282000,Clemmie,Thats only a list of 360 elements. Should run basically instantaneously. The data processing time will likely dwarf the munging year &lt;-&gt; month
690,2019-02-12T14:06:39.282300,Deangelo,"right, makes sense"
690,2019-02-12T14:06:42.282500,Deangelo,"in your loop, what happens if you only get  an array of 12 months. Doesn't it skip one year?"
690,2019-02-12T14:07:24.283200,Deangelo,and I think you meant `len(monthly) &gt; 12` instead of `len(monthly &gt; 12)`
690,2019-02-12T14:09:21.284500,Clemmie,"Yup. nut the last year is handled by the line after the loop. Strictly speaking you could do it without the length check like this (I did it the way I did because I forgot if slicing would throw an index erorr. It doesn’t so this is better)
```
monthly = &lt;yourlist&gt;
yearly = []
while len(monthly) &gt; 0:
	year, monthly = sum(monthly[:12]), monthly[12:]
	year.append(yearly)

690,2019-02-12T14:19:14.286800,Deangelo,checking like input validation?

693,2019-02-12T18:13:39.324900,Rodrick,The same EOL
693,2019-02-12T18:16:00.326100,Sasha,"I'm sorry, I misinformed you. The raw string syntax is a little bit more complex, since it still needs to be able to detect when the string ends, so escaped quotes still exist under different rules. Ignore what I said, and just escape your backslashes."

694,2019-02-12T18:00:52.314300,Deangelo,"hello, a quick question. What's the fastest way to get the length of an array up until there are no more non-zero values. eg. usefulLen([0,1,2,0,1,0,0]) == 5"
694,2019-02-12T18:01:40.315100,Deangelo,I can reverse loop and stop when a non-zero is encountered
694,2019-02-12T18:16:51.327500,Deangelo,"<@Carmen> I got 2 alternatives:
```
def usefulLen(a):
  var = len(a)
  while var &gt; 0:
    if a[var-1] &gt; 0: break
    var = var - 1
  return var

def usefulLen2(a):
  for i,v in reversed(list(enumerate(a))):
    if v &gt; 0: return i + 1
  return len(a)

a = [0,1,2,0,1,0,0]
print(usefulLen2(a))
&gt; 5
```"
694,2019-02-12T18:24:41.329900,Carmen,"So both of them are equally-readable, it just depends on what the background of the person reading it is. C/C++ programmers will probably parse the first one fairly easily. But the second one is more pythonic and easier for any particular Python dev to read, IMO."

695,2019-02-12T19:35:50.335500,Kristine,"So last week I was asking about handling the editing and printing of a document with an image, and I got some advice, and I’ve finally settled on a solution, so for anyone who’s interested in how that ended up: I played around with trying to make an .odt template for a while, but lp didn’t really want to print it, so then I figured I’d try xhtml2pdf (which someone here mentioned) to see if lp would print PDF’s (I can’t imagine why it wouldn’t, but I wanted to do a test just to be sure), but I found that xhtml2pdf has in the past tried to deprecate itself in favor of weasyprint, and though it has revived, I figured why not just go with weasyprint… So I tried that, but it didn’t like working with .odt files either, so I generated the document as an .html webpage (which was my first idea anyways), converted it to a PDF using weasyprint, and it printed flawlessly. Once I get this small page margin issue sorted out, I just have to write a python script to take the incoming data, replace it in the page, convert it to a PDF, and print it."

698,2019-02-13T03:25:52.351300,Malena,Does anyone know what order `pip` uses when you do a `pip install` from a requirements.txt file? Does it matter what order those packages are in the file?
699,2019-02-13T03:42:04.353200,Philip,"So uhm, I'm still having problems with `hmac` in `python` and `javascript`.
Here is a sample python snippet
```
import hmac

ham = ""foo""
hmac.new(""secret"".encode(), ham.encode(), hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
```
and here's the javascript snippet :
```
spam = ""foo""
let john = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(`${spam}`, 'secret');
```
which both results in `773ba44693c7553d6ee20f61ea5d2757a9a4f4a44d2841ae4e95b52e4cd62db4`"
699,2019-02-13T03:43:17.354100,Philip,"The thing is, when I do
```

```
and
```
let ham = {

```
the results does not match"
699,2019-02-13T03:43:56.354900,Philip,I'm probably doing something incorrect with the `dict` object.
699,2019-02-13T03:49:08.355300,Malena,"I'm thinking that `${ham}` does not result in ""{'foo': 'bar'}"""
699,2019-02-13T03:49:58.355900,Malena,"You'll also find that interestingly, `str(spam)` turns the double-quotes into single-quotes."
699,2019-02-13T03:51:27.356600,Malena,First thing to try I think is to use `json.dumps(spam)` instead of `str`.
699,2019-02-13T03:54:48.357700,Shawana,<@Malena> maybe this is the issue you are looking for? <https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker/issues/553> no solution yet

699,2019-02-13T04:01:47.361400,Malena,I suppose you could try doing it with the actual string representations as a quick test too.

699,2019-02-13T04:15:38.365400,Philip,Do you suppose this is the main reason why dictionary object in python and javascript does not match when doing `hmac`?
699,2019-02-13T04:20:38.365700,Malena,"Oh you forgot the single quotes:
let ham = '{""foo"": ""bar""}'"
699,2019-02-13T04:20:47.365900,Malena,You want to use strings.
699,2019-02-13T04:21:08.366100,Malena,"Hmm, but I see where you're going with this."
699,2019-02-13T04:21:49.366300,Malena,"Basically, you want your python dictionary to be serialized in the exact same way as your js object."
699,2019-02-13T04:22:33.366500,Malena,One thing to watch out for is ensuring that they are serialized in the same way/same order.
699,2019-02-13T04:23:33.366700,Philip,"Yes, I mean the strings output the same `hmac` but unfortunately I don't think ```CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(`${ham}`, 'secret')``` is converted into string format. I'm still looking for an appropriate docs for the javascript"
699,2019-02-13T04:24:15.367200,Malena,Maybe JSON.stringify(data)
699,2019-02-13T04:24:39.367500,Philip,but if its `JSON.stringify(data)` shouldn't `json.dumps` work?
699,2019-02-13T04:24:52.367700,Malena,That's for the js.
699,2019-02-13T04:24:54.367900,Philip,Though I'll give that a shot as well
699,2019-02-13T04:25:04.368100,Malena,JSON.stringify(ham)
699,2019-02-13T04:25:22.368300,Philip,"Sorry, I meant to say `json.dumps` is the counterpart for `JSON.stringify` if I'm not mistaken"
699,2019-02-13T04:25:33.368500,Malena,I believe so.
699,2019-02-13T04:27:13.368800,Malena,Ohhhhh.

705,2019-02-13T06:38:01.389300,Mica,also you need to define the class too
705,2019-02-13T06:38:15.389900,Conrad,"ah no not these, I meant language skills. the kind you add by adding a profile section and looking under accomplishments"

705,2019-02-13T06:40:33.392400,Mica,could use comprehension to create a dict

y = {a: b for a, b in zip(x, range(len(x)))}

705,2019-02-13T06:45:35.396400,Yaeko,"Ok, completely rephrase my question into what I actually wants:
I have a function that takes a tuple giving x,y coordinates bounded by `(rows cols)`, which I want to convert into a index for a list of length `rows * cols`."
705,2019-02-13T06:47:16.396600,Mica,does the above not work?
705,2019-02-13T06:47:49.397200,Mica,"you can replace `range(len(x))` with `range(0, (rows * cols))`"
705,2019-02-13T06:48:04.397500,Mica,as long as you know the no. of cols and rows
705,2019-02-13T06:50:45.399100,Malena,"Umm, If your list is x:

`x= [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3),  (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]``

then to get the index of (1,2) then you can `x.index((1,2))`"
705,2019-02-13T06:51:31.400000,Malena,I'll shut up if I'm misunderstanding your question. :smile:

705,2019-02-13T06:57:38.404400,Mica,you can use a dict comp to create a dictionary lookup
705,2019-02-13T06:58:02.405100,Mica,<@Aracelis> the issue is the age is an int and not a str
705,2019-02-13T06:58:18.405900,Mica,"there's two solutions, either convert to str using `str()` or use string formatting"
705,2019-02-13T06:58:29.406300,Mica,either using `''.format()` or the new f-strings
705,2019-02-13T06:58:50.406800,Yaeko,"Yeah, thanks <@Tracie>, that would work. It might not be a nice `x + y + something` equation to calculate these in an easy way. :taco:"

705,2019-02-13T07:20:19.409600,Lorinda,hello guys
705,2019-02-13T07:20:26.409700,Lorinda,None
705,2019-02-13T07:20:46.410200,Lorinda,Guys I need help with the above code.
705,2019-02-13T07:21:05.410600,Ashley,What's your question?
705,2019-02-13T07:21:13.410900,Lorinda,This is from QSpectrumAnalyzer
705,2019-02-13T07:21:23.411400,Lorinda,and I have connected HackRF
705,2019-02-13T07:23:01.413400,Lorinda,This is the process initiated for the start button to start scanning. There is also encoded the restart process of the hardware (hackrf) and that's what I am trying to implement. I have made all the necessary changes and I now have created the def process_reset(self) to initiate the code hackrf_spiflash -R that does the reset.
705,2019-02-13T07:23:29.414100,Lorinda,However I don't understand the above code block that does the start... in order to mirror the process and do the reset process.
705,2019-02-13T07:24:29.414600,Ashley,What don't you understand about it?
705,2019-02-13T07:26:00.415300,Lorinda,"I would like someone to explain line by line what it does... for example what is this: ""-f"", ""{}...."
705,2019-02-13T07:26:11.415600,Lorinda,I am pretty beginner and the task is above my level
705,2019-02-13T07:26:16.415800,Lorinda,but it must be done.
705,2019-02-13T07:29:11.417400,Ashley,"Well, I can't really go line by line, but the bulk of it seems to pretty much just be generating a command to call in the shell/command prompt, and then at the end it does so"
705,2019-02-13T07:29:47.418300,Ashley,"It looks like you're printing out towards the end, which should tell you what the exact command is that it's calling"
705,2019-02-13T07:31:22.418500,Lorinda,thanks for the tip
705,2019-02-13T07:31:33.418800,Lorinda,any idea how i could implement the reset function?
705,2019-02-13T07:31:52.419300,Lorinda,is the above code a good representation of what i must do with reseT?
705,2019-02-13T07:33:07.421400,Ashley,"I'm unfamiliar with those tools, but probably not. But it should tell you what the main command is, and you can look up the documentation for it where there should be something about resetting it, if that's something it supports"
705,2019-02-13T07:36:02.421800,Lorinda,yep the command hackrf_spiflash -r
705,2019-02-13T07:36:04.422100,Lorinda,does the reset
705,2019-02-13T07:36:32.422600,Lorinda,but i don't yet know how should i start to implent it on the process_reset()
705,2019-02-13T07:38:58.422900,Ashley,"Oh, sorry, I misunderstood"
705,2019-02-13T07:39:16.423600,Ashley,"Then yeah, you can mimic the code in that function"
705,2019-02-13T07:39:55.424000,Lorinda,"ok where can i find what this does for example: ""-f"", ""{}:{}"".format(int(self.params[""start_freq""] - self.lnb_lo / 1e6),
                                     int(self.params[""stop_freq""] - self.lnb_lo / 1e6)),"
705,2019-02-13T07:42:50.426200,Ashley,"Well, the `""{}:{}”.format()` stuff is just how string formatting is done in Python (there's a few ways, but this is a common one)"
705,2019-02-13T07:43:15.426800,Ashley,"In general, Python has to evaluate things in a certain order"
705,2019-02-13T07:44:40.428700,Ashley,"You'll notice that that's inside a `cmdline.extend()` call. `cmdline` seems to be just a normal list, and the `extend` method of a list takes another list, and slaps it into the end of that list"
705,2019-02-13T07:44:58.429300,Ashley,"So you're ""extending"" `cmdline`"
705,2019-02-13T07:45:44.430500,Ashley,"But to know what you're extending it with, Python has to figure out what you're passing to `extend`"
705,2019-02-13T07:46:01.431100,Ashley,"And to figure the out, it has to evaluate the things inside of the list one at a time"
705,2019-02-13T07:46:30.431600,Ashley,"The first thing is easy. It's just `""-f""`"
705,2019-02-13T07:47:01.432500,Ashley,"But the next thing takes a little more, because to figure that out, it has to look at the things you're passing to `format`"
705,2019-02-13T07:47:30.432800,Ashley,It's kinda like PEMDAS
705,2019-02-13T07:50:20.435800,Ashley,"If you ignore the `subprocess` and `QtCore` stuff, you're pretty much only dealing with simple python stuff (it's really just lists, numbers, and strings). It's only the context that seems complicated, but you know what you're working with, so you should be fine"
705,2019-02-13T07:55:48.436100,Lorinda,Thanks a lot for the help and time.
705,2019-02-13T08:06:34.436300,Ashley,Np!
706,2019-02-13T07:16:49.408600,Malena,"Err, using the data you provided, then `f` would be:
`def f(x,y): return ((x -1) * 3) + y - 1`"

                    etc..```
Anyone know how `for data in data[""data""]` can be a none type? where before that its specifically checking for that"
707,2019-02-13T08:59:34.439400,Hiroko,"well,if data[‘data’] is `None`, then none of your checks look for that"
707,2019-02-13T08:59:45.439700,Hiroko,`if data` checks if `data` is None
707,2019-02-13T09:00:16.440400,Hiroko,`and 'data' in data` checks if the key `data` exists
707,2019-02-13T09:00:42.440900,Hiroko,but `data['data']` can be None
707,2019-02-13T09:08:25.441400,Adolfo,"That makes a lot of sense, <@Hiroko> thank you. thats probably what it is."
707,2019-02-13T09:12:39.442300,Mica,"I'd probably wrap the check `if data[""data""] is not None:` with a `try/except KeyError`"
707,2019-02-13T09:20:24.442700,Yaeko,"<@Malena> Great, solved exactly what I needed :taco:"
707,2019-02-13T09:21:33.443100,Malena,Effectively you've got a 3-bit number.
707,2019-02-13T09:23:32.443700,Adolfo,"would you wrap the try except before the if data and ""data"" in data or before the for loop?"
707,2019-02-13T09:25:31.443900,Mica,"before:
```
try:
  if data['data'] is not None:
    do_something()
except KeyError:
  pass
```"
707,2019-02-13T09:26:46.444100,Adolfo,thank you sir!
707,2019-02-13T09:27:08.444300,Mica,no worries! Let me know if you have any issues!
707,2019-02-13T09:28:07.444500,Adolfo,testing out.. shortly
707,2019-02-13T09:36:43.444700,Adolfo,you think
707,2019-02-13T09:37:19.444900,Adolfo,"```

if data and ""data"" in data and data[""data""] is not None:
            for data in data[""data""]:


```"
707,2019-02-13T09:39:22.445300,Mica,"you don't need `if data` at the start and if you check `data[""data""]` and it's not there it'll throw a `KeyError` exception"
707,2019-02-13T09:39:35.445500,Melynda,I can _never_ get multiple loop syntax right without looking it up :confused:
707,2019-02-13T09:39:42.445700,Mica,you either nest the conditions or do what i suggested
707,2019-02-13T09:42:07.445900,Clemmie,"Same here - the only reason I got it is because I had to just do one, looked it up, and then remembered this was asked yesterday :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:"
707,2019-02-13T09:43:34.446100,Adolfo,if data at start checks to see the api call succeded?
707,2019-02-13T09:44:22.446400,Mica,"you can't do them all on the same line, plus you don't need that check it's redundant"
707,2019-02-13T09:44:32.446600,Mica,if there's not data then surely it was unsuccessful right?
707,2019-02-13T09:44:37.446800,Adolfo,yea
707,2019-02-13T09:45:47.447000,Adolfo,what happens if the query to get data fails?
707,2019-02-13T09:46:13.447200,Mica,"you need to handle that separately, depends how the requests handles it"
707,2019-02-13T09:46:21.447400,Mica,depends what it returns if it fails
707,2019-02-13T09:47:49.447600,Adolfo,it return a False so the caller can handle it accordingly
707,2019-02-13T09:48:10.447800,Adolfo,what if im intentionally checking a condition causes a fail?
707,2019-02-13T09:49:40.448000,Mica,"you'll want to explicitly check for False, as it doesn't return True if it's successful, it returns the data"
708,2019-02-13T09:18:42.442400,Clemmie,"If you haven’t figured this out yet, it is because when doing nested loops in list comprehensions the order of loops goes from the outside in, not the inside out as seems natural.

710,2019-02-13T10:51:09.452900,Arturo,It is built in java not c++
710,2019-02-13T10:54:24.454100,Jonas,"I'm not familiar with the pywinauto library or the iManager app. If there is no login button that is exposed then it's not exposing this to Windows, which means automating and clicking it will be real hard"
710,2019-02-13T10:55:02.454600,Jonas,"Is it using the Java UI toolkit, or do the buttons and widgets look like native Windows ones?"

I have my main module (tkinter) which uses stored variables to be fired off within another module. i.e. enter date and date is used in the other module. the issue is that I am having to type out each function separate and i have a feeling this is not the right way, or at least the best way, to do this. Another issue is that in the line ""SSH_Invoices.c_date = self.page1_sel_date.get()"" - ""c_date"" does not get stored."
711,2019-02-13T11:24:34.459400,Jonas,What is `SSH_Invoices`? A module?
711,2019-02-13T11:25:01.460200,Nenita,correct. it is the main class name
711,2019-02-13T11:25:11.460700,Jonas,"Wait, is it a module or a class?"
711,2019-02-13T11:25:20.461000,Clemmie,"Can you do an `__init__` that takes the date and a run flag, if you pass the run flag it triggers `statements()`"
711,2019-02-13T11:25:26.461300,Nenita,class more specifically. module name is actually SSH.

711,2019-02-13T11:26:35.463700,Jonas,"Ok, so a module in Python is a file. It's all the contents of a file bundled up into an object, a 'module'"
711,2019-02-13T11:26:49.464300,Jonas,Generally you never do `module.something = something_else`

711,2019-02-13T11:27:14.465500,Clemmie,"It would be in `SSH_Invoices`, but at the moment you are not using instances, just `classmethod/static` calls"
711,2019-02-13T11:27:42.466300,Jonas,"Classes live in modules, and are created by doing `something = SomeClass()`. You can pass things into a class by calling it like a function: `SomeClass(some_variable, something=else)`"
711,2019-02-13T11:27:54.466800,Jonas,"You have `__init__` methods on classes, not modules."
711,2019-02-13T11:28:11.467600,Jonas,And when you do `SomeClass()` the `SomeClass.__init__` is called with it's arguments
711,2019-02-13T11:28:35.467900,Nenita,"this is the ssh module. please notate that with been having to go back and forth trying to figure this out, I have had to make some changes that were not there originally. i.e. when I ran the module separately rather than using my main module."
711,2019-02-13T11:28:46.468300,Nenita,one sec and...
711,2019-02-13T11:29:24.468400,Nenita,this is the line that is calling all of  it. now this function is really messy. Haven't been working on it too long.
711,2019-02-13T11:29:45.469000,Nenita,oh! <@Jonas> i see what your saying
711,2019-02-13T11:29:54.469400,Mica,you need to instantiate the class
711,2019-02-13T11:29:57.469500,Jonas,"Ok, so I see a few issues here"
711,2019-02-13T11:30:13.470100,Mica,the only exception is for staticmethods :parrot:
711,2019-02-13T11:30:16.470300,Jonas,In general it's not great practice to do what you are doing in `.statements()`
711,2019-02-13T11:30:32.470700,Jonas,"you're setting some variables, then you _expect_ people to call `run_statements()`"
711,2019-02-13T11:30:46.471600,Jonas,which uses a class variable and does the right thing :tm:
711,2019-02-13T11:30:55.472000,Jonas,you could make `run_statements` accept an argument of statements
711,2019-02-13T11:31:13.472700,Jonas,"then when you call `statements()`, it then calls `self.run_statements([....])`?"
711,2019-02-13T11:31:18.472900,Nenita,thats what im planning
711,2019-02-13T11:31:28.473200,Nenita,after i read your previous comment
711,2019-02-13T11:32:10.473700,Jonas,:+1: avoid passing state around using instance variables.
711,2019-02-13T11:32:21.474300,Jonas,"So, for your `statements()` method, it needs a date"
711,2019-02-13T11:32:26.474600,Jonas,so why not add this as an argument
711,2019-02-13T11:32:37.475100,Jonas,then do `SSH_invoices.statements(self.page1_sel_date.get())`?
711,2019-02-13T11:32:37.475200,Nenita,"yep, thats why i ask the question from the get-go because I was like, 'there is no way i am going to find a good answer as specific as im needing using google'."
711,2019-02-13T11:33:17.476100,Jonas,"You also need an instance of the class, as <@Mica> pointed out. So try doing `invoices = SSH_Invoices()`"
711,2019-02-13T11:33:23.476400,Jonas,then `invoices.statements()`
711,2019-02-13T11:33:33.476600,Nenita,"i plan on doing that. after reading your comment ""You can pass things into a class by calling it like a function: `SomeClass(some_variable, something=else)`"""
711,2019-02-13T11:33:56.477300,Jonas,":+1: awesome. One other thing, you may want to keep the `SSH_Invoices` object around for a while"
711,2019-02-13T11:34:02.477500,Nenita,aaaand now i see what you mean by an instance of a class. lol
711,2019-02-13T11:34:04.477700,Jonas,it creates a SSH client which may be expensive to create
711,2019-02-13T11:34:20.478200,Jonas,"so you could do `invoices = SSH_Invoices()` at the top of your module, after your imports"
711,2019-02-13T11:34:27.478500,Jonas,or somewhere else that runs when the app starts.
711,2019-02-13T11:36:12.480000,Nenita,well ill let you guys know if i get it going and show you what i end up doing if i do. thanks <@Tracie> <@Jonas> <@Clemmie>
711,2019-02-13T11:36:43.480400,Clemmie,<@Jonas> <@Mica> :taco:
712,2019-02-13T11:44:06.481100,Angele,"<@Carmen> Thanks again. Couple of questions about the above snippet (didn't work): Shouldn't it be this?
```
def f3(f2, frame_list):
    f2_param = None
    return_list = []
    for frame in frame_list:
        new_f2 = lambda frame, f2_param: f2(frame, f2_param)
        (other_output, f2_param) = fl_image(new_f2(frame, f2_param)
       return_list.append(other_output)
    return return_list
```"
712,2019-02-13T11:51:46.481900,Angele,"Here, f2_param is a list. So I'm getting an error when I pass it as a None. When I use the above code, it still doesn't work because fl_image (f1) does not expect a list argument (does not support variable number of arguments)"
712,2019-02-13T11:52:54.482100,Jorge,None
712,2019-02-13T11:53:27.483000,Jorge,what do you all prefer for getting the elements of one list but not another?
712,2019-02-13T11:53:56.483400,Clemmie,Sets if order and duplicates don’t matter. List comprehension if they do
712,2019-02-13T11:58:53.483500,Angele,Could a decorator help to override the default fl_image function call..?
712,2019-02-13T12:05:19.483700,Nenita,"I'll be making a settings frame in the future to store all the variable info for ssh. i.e. ip, user, pass. Otherwise, works wonderfully. And this is all in my main module."
713,2019-02-13T12:26:58.484200,Angele,I've also posted the same question to the Reddit group of the library: <https://www.reddit.com/r/moviepy/comments/aq9007/accessing_previous_frames_in_videoclipfl_image/>
713,2019-02-13T12:27:16.484600,Angele,Perhaps the explanation is clearer there..
713,2019-02-13T12:34:04.485300,Carmen,"So I honestly don't know what a good initial value for `f2_param` is, I was just putting a placeholder there that you could replace as-necessary."
713,2019-02-13T12:36:20.487100,Claudine,Like design patterns?
713,2019-02-13T12:36:21.487300,Claudine,<https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans>
713,2019-02-13T12:36:42.487700,Claudine,or if you want something more python specific
713,2019-02-13T12:36:43.487900,Claudine,<https://python-patterns.guide/>
713,2019-02-13T12:38:21.488000,Carmen,"As for how I was providing the parameters to `f1_image`,  I was basing it off of the documentation of the function. It appears to take your `f2` function as the first parameter and the image as the second parameter. The `new_f2` function is my way of converting the 2-parameter function into a 1-parameter function, which is what the `f1_image` function is expecting."
713,2019-02-13T12:45:38.488400,Angele,"I see the problem now: new_f2 returns a tuple ( the image and the new parameter). However, fl_image needs to access only the image (first element of the tuple)"
713,2019-02-13T12:46:38.488600,Angele,"So, the question is; How can f1-image access the first element of the tuple returned by new_f2?"
713,2019-02-13T12:47:11.489100,Angele,"Like so:
```
(other_output, f2_param) = fl_image(new_f2[0], frame)
```"
713,2019-02-13T12:47:48.489400,Angele,?
713,2019-02-13T12:48:08.489700,Nola,I noticed some blank data cells when running my for loop. The data is the same in both so it should be able to see 100% of the values. I cant figure out how to search the entire data_2['final_desc_2'] but search the row['sequence_2'] text one by one
713,2019-02-13T12:52:29.493600,Angele,Put in another way: Is there a way to access the return value of a lambda function during invocation?
713,2019-02-13T12:53:22.495500,Cammie,"Can some help me either find a vocab word that describes what I’m looking for *or* write a function to do it? _I don’t believe what I’m looking for are `permutations`, `combinations` or `cartisean products`_

I have two lists
`foo = [1, 2, 3]`
`bar = [a, b]`

I want to take those two lists and create a list of lists of every way I can given an  element of `bar` to an element of `foo`. The order of the elements in the tuple matter, but the order of the elements in the list do not. The output above should look like:

```
[
    [(1, a), (2, b)],
    [(2, a), (3, b)],
    [(1, a), (3, b)],
    [(1, b), (2, a)],
    [(1, b), (3, a)],
    [(2, b), (3, a)]
]
```

To clarify, the tuple order is always `(&lt;foo item&gt;, &lt;bar item&gt;)`

Does anyone have a vocab word or a pythonic way to do this? If it helps, I’m looking to design a Tree to show all the different paths I could take. This seems to be more challenging than I thought…"
713,2019-02-13T12:57:18.496200,Nola,Maybe I'm doing more work then I need. ANyone know of a way to search a column for all elements of a list? I'm thinking if i turn my 'sequence' column into a list maybe this will be easier
713,2019-02-13T13:05:13.496800,Jonas,"Your question is not clear, i would break it down into generic problems and we can help you out"
713,2019-02-13T13:07:15.498100,Cammie,No worries. I updated the expected output to be more clear
713,2019-02-13T13:08:19.498500,Bethany,"ok i think i understand what you're trying to do, thinking"
713,2019-02-13T13:30:09.501300,Bethany,n_children choose n_cookies
713,2019-02-13T13:30:16.501500,Bethany,thats the statistical term
713,2019-02-13T13:30:24.501700,Bethany,well the number of them
713,2019-02-13T13:31:35.502100,Bethany,thats just combination though
713,2019-02-13T13:31:45.502600,Cammie,I’m with you.
713,2019-02-13T13:31:54.502800,Cammie,"Every solution that codes a combination, does so in one big list."
713,2019-02-13T13:32:06.503000,Cammie,Actually hold up. I dont’ think this is correct.
713,2019-02-13T13:32:18.503200,Cammie,Because a child can have up to one cookie
713,2019-02-13T13:32:18.503400,Bethany,yeah I dont think your metaphor captures the problem
713,2019-02-13T13:32:20.503600,Cammie,so they may have none
713,2019-02-13T13:32:29.503800,Bethany,yes so each children has 2 states
713,2019-02-13T13:32:30.504000,Cammie,"To be honest, the metaphor IS the problem"
713,2019-02-13T13:32:48.504200,Cammie,and what I posted was my attempt to make it easier to understand
713,2019-02-13T13:33:00.504400,Bethany,are you doing something with microstates and entropy
713,2019-02-13T13:33:15.504600,Bethany,or literally cookies
713,2019-02-13T13:33:24.504800,Cammie,uh literally cookies and children
713,2019-02-13T13:34:05.505100,Bethany,yes so the problem is : I have N children and M cookies. List all possible ways I can give out the cookies
713,2019-02-13T13:34:10.505300,Cammie,Correct.
713,2019-02-13T13:34:29.505500,Cammie,"Where N can be &lt;, =, &gt; M"
713,2019-02-13T13:34:53.505800,Bethany,if max you can give is 1 though if M &gt; N there's only one way: everybody gets one
713,2019-02-13T13:35:08.506000,Cammie,Yup
713,2019-02-13T13:35:12.506200,Cammie,The cookies can have different weights.
713,2019-02-13T13:35:18.506400,Cammie,So it still matters.
713,2019-02-13T13:35:34.506700,Cammie,i’m trying to only talk about specifically what I think is important and I think that’s biting me in the ass when we discuss this
713,2019-02-13T13:35:53.506900,Bethany,usually that's the case.
713,2019-02-13T13:36:13.507200,Cammie,"basically a list of strings, denoting children"
713,2019-02-13T13:36:17.507400,Cammie,"list of ints, denoting cookie weights"
713,2019-02-13T13:36:29.507600,Cammie,"What are all the ways to give out the cookies, where each child can have at most one cookie"
713,2019-02-13T13:36:35.507900,Cammie,That’s the whole problem
713,2019-02-13T13:36:48.508100,Cammie,"I can code this up in a disgusting way, but I was looking for a vocab word or elegant pythonic way"
713,2019-02-13T13:36:56.508300,Cammie,Does that all make sense?
713,2019-02-13T13:36:59.508500,Bethany,and there's duplicates weights right?
713,2019-02-13T13:37:03.508700,Cammie,there can be
713,2019-02-13T13:37:10.508900,Cammie,they’re not unique by default
713,2019-02-13T13:37:12.509100,Bethany,"like [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5 ... ]"
713,2019-02-13T13:37:14.509300,Cammie,sure
713,2019-02-13T13:37:15.509500,Cammie,that’s valid
713,2019-02-13T13:37:22.509800,Cammie,"so is
[1, 2, 3]"
713,2019-02-13T13:37:47.510000,Bethany,this is a bit more interesting
713,2019-02-13T13:37:55.510200,Cammie,hahaha :heart:
713,2019-02-13T13:37:59.510400,Cammie,Thank you for bearing with me
713,2019-02-13T13:38:02.510600,Cammie,i’ve loved this discussion
713,2019-02-13T13:39:12.510800,Bethany,so really what you're dealing with is n_children. You need to put them into groups (cookie weight). The # of children you can put in each group is the # of cookies with that same weight
713,2019-02-13T13:39:28.511000,Bethany,within the group it's indistignuishable who gets each cookie
713,2019-02-13T13:42:08.511200,Cammie,"If possible, can you reword it. If I understand correctly than no, that is not correct at all."
713,2019-02-13T13:42:13.511400,Cammie,But I’m fearful I didn’t understand
713,2019-02-13T13:44:04.511600,Bethany,do you need the number of ways to do this or to enumerate the possibilites?
713,2019-02-13T13:44:04.511800,Bethany,internet went down
713,2019-02-13T13:50:26.512000,Bethany,gotta go back to work
713,2019-02-13T13:50:34.512200,Bethany,you might need some clever programming for this
713,2019-02-13T13:53:37.512400,Cammie,I need to actually enumerate
713,2019-02-13T13:53:48.512600,Cammie,"No worries mate, thanks for everything regarldess"

717,2019-02-13T15:24:14.514000,Candra,How is pytest for integration testing
717,2019-02-13T15:24:23.514400,Tarsha,good
717,2019-02-13T15:24:45.514900,Candra,Currently stuck on nose + unittest but I'm swapping out nose for pytest and keeping the basic unittest foundation for now
717,2019-02-13T15:28:05.515700,Candra,But eventually the unit tests need to be tied together to pass input along and it seems like fixtures and context builders will help
717,2019-02-13T15:33:00.515900,Tarsha,yeah the fixtures are pretty good

717,2019-02-13T15:33:27.516900,Tarsha,pytest is definitely worth investing some time into
717,2019-02-13T15:37:21.517900,Candra,"Having been working with these unittests, the output diff and code snippet is insanely useful"
717,2019-02-13T15:37:28.518100,Candra,from pytest that is
717,2019-02-13T15:37:53.518500,Jonas,`parametrize` is the biggest killer for me
717,2019-02-13T15:38:19.519100,Jonas,"most tests are pretty similar. being able to convert a single test into 5 or 6 different ones, but with a single method and `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, is amazing"
717,2019-02-13T15:38:57.519400,Candra,Yeah that's exactly what I was looking to do
717,2019-02-13T15:39:09.519800,Candra,I have a single test which runs the same stuff with different values over and over like 6 times

718,2019-02-13T18:15:32.521400,Monica,when is a good time to use a python array? From `import array`
718,2019-02-13T18:18:19.521800,Sharita,Just stick to a list
718,2019-02-13T18:18:49.522300,Sasha,"Mostly when you have a large amount of numeric data, like pixels in an image."
718,2019-02-13T18:19:14.522700,Hiroko,"even so, if you have that much, you might as well bring numpy in and use `ndarray`s"
718,2019-02-13T18:23:48.523000,Monica,I see. thanks guys
718,2019-02-13T18:24:02.523300,Monica,This language is perfect for quizing people
718,2019-02-13T19:52:52.525400,Janella,"Django question here, I have a form I need to post, some of the fields need to be auto populated with info from a model. I feel like I'm stuck in a revolving door, as I want to use a for loop of the data from the model in my template however then I can't use my formset loop to create multiple forms"
718,2019-02-13T19:55:16.527000,Janella,I tried using hidden fields in my template but with no success
719,2019-02-13T20:43:24.528100,Sharita,"model forms and model choice fields, use them"
719,2019-02-13T20:46:12.528300,Janella,yea I just changed it to a model form and I am getting somewhere
719,2019-02-13T20:46:39.528500,Janella,I finally got the post request to work
719,2019-02-13T20:52:25.528900,Janella,"but it is not only providing new fields to enter new data into the model, it's also bringing in fields to update the current data in the model, which I don't want"
720,2019-02-13T21:18:20.531300,Junior,Hello all. I've been using <http://ASP.NET|ASP.NET> to create an interface to manipulate data (standard CRUD stuff) and started looking at Flask to implement something similar using Python but is that even a worthwhile way to go? I'm concerned about expending a lot of effort inefficiently. What would you all suggest?
720,2019-02-13T23:18:21.533100,Candra,"<@Junior> I think this really depends on how big your application is, what it's actually used for and if you know or are willing to learn python"
721,2019-02-14T00:38:31.534000,Kia,file not found 404

721,2019-02-14T00:40:31.535200,Cory,It looks like you're trying to send a POST request to a local python file instead of a HTTP endpoint
721,2019-02-14T00:41:57.536100,Kia,could you please share code what i am doing wrong ?
721,2019-02-14T00:42:14.536300,Sasha,"You want to specify the upload URL, not the file."
721,2019-02-14T00:43:08.536500,Sasha,As your form action.
721,2019-02-14T00:44:39.536700,Kia,actually upload.py is pyhon code file
721,2019-02-14T00:45:42.536900,Cory,"the ""action="" should point to a web server URL, not a filename"
721,2019-02-14T00:46:02.537100,Cory,and that URL should be defined in your application to accept POST request types
721,2019-02-14T00:46:26.537300,Sasha,"The web browser submitting the form doesn't have access to your Python files, after all."
721,2019-02-14T00:46:29.537500,Cory,For example: <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/#http-methods>
721,2019-02-14T00:56:34.537700,Kia,None
721,2019-02-14T00:57:11.538700,Kia,<@Sasha> <@Cory>
721,2019-02-14T00:57:46.539400,Cory,"Ok, so change your HTML form action to `action=""<http://127.0.0.1:5000/uploading>""`"
721,2019-02-14T00:58:08.539800,Cory,then make sure your development server is running and serving files
721,2019-02-14T01:02:12.540100,Kia,now getting these logs
721,2019-02-14T01:04:33.541200,Cory,"Ok, that's progress. You'll need to do some debugging to find out why that KeyError is raised. Probably `fileitem = form['filename']` this key doesn't exist in that object"
722,2019-02-14T01:38:44.541500,Aracelis,Please explain me this part of code..
722,2019-02-14T01:40:01.542400,Aracelis,"what is %d,%s and % &amp;\n"
722,2019-02-14T01:43:39.543000,Cory,"%d is for a numeric value, %s is for a string"
722,2019-02-14T01:44:55.543400,Cory,`\n` is a linefeed (goes to next line)
722,2019-02-14T01:46:45.544400,Cory,"the last `%` is a python string formatting method. It's replacing %d and %s in the string with the values of self.id and self.name, respectively"
722,2019-02-14T01:59:29.545000,Valeri,I was wondering how I could keep only my commits on a branch and discard any commit made by others
722,2019-02-14T02:00:00.545600,Valeri,Tried googling but couldn't find something like that
722,2019-02-14T02:00:19.545900,Cory,fork the project so that it's your own private repo
722,2019-02-14T02:00:55.546400,Valeri,Oh no!
722,2019-02-14T02:01:08.546800,Valeri,You misinterpreted I guess
722,2019-02-14T02:01:35.547400,Valeri,I just want my changes on a branch. A co-worker pushed their changes on my branch
722,2019-02-14T02:01:40.547600,Valeri,I want to discard them
722,2019-02-14T02:03:00.548400,Cory,git?
722,2019-02-14T02:03:02.548500,Valeri,Basically I'm looking for a way to filter out  my commits on the branch and keep them
722,2019-02-14T02:03:04.548700,Valeri,Yes
722,2019-02-14T02:03:44.549400,Cory,you could look at `git log` to find the commit(s) you want to revert
722,2019-02-14T02:03:49.549600,Cory,then use `git revert`
722,2019-02-14T02:06:49.549800,Valeri,No I can't
722,2019-02-14T02:07:14.550500,Valeri,The problem is the commits are in random order
722,2019-02-14T02:07:23.550800,Valeri,Depending upon when they were authored
722,2019-02-14T02:07:38.551300,Valeri,I could have cherry picked the latest commit done by me otherwise
722,2019-02-14T02:07:48.551600,Valeri,And that would have solved my problem
722,2019-02-14T02:08:06.551900,Valeri,"I think I should ask this on SO, what say?"
722,2019-02-14T02:09:07.552200,Cory,Hmm I see. Not sure what would be best
722,2019-02-14T02:10:13.552600,Cory,I'm new here but I imagine this server is busier during US business hours

728,2019-02-14T08:59:21.580900,Mica,an API call to an external call is just redirecting to that API's URL

728,2019-02-14T09:03:30.586700,Jonas,It's also a bit too verbose and may be hard for non-native speakers to read
728,2019-02-14T09:03:56.587400,Mica,"ye, i see what you mean, it's a lot to take in when asking a question"
728,2019-02-14T09:04:01.587500,Jonas,Something that breaks down about writing the most specific _general_ question you can
728,2019-02-14T09:04:41.588900,Mica,"I guess it's important to have done the following:
1) made an attempt
2) shown/sa y what you've tried
3) show the error/stacktrace"
728,2019-02-14T09:04:43.589000,Jonas,"Not: ""my api returns a list and the extraction service needs to break this into tuples for our clients"", but ""how do i turn a list into a sequence of tuples"""
728,2019-02-14T09:05:00.589400,Mica,nothing worse thn someone asking what the error is :stuck_out_tongue:
728,2019-02-14T09:05:14.589800,Jonas,"yeah, something like that list would be much better IMO"
728,2019-02-14T09:05:35.590400,Mica,I guess the above question is much more googleable
728,2019-02-14T09:05:37.590600,Jonas,things in that SO post like relevant tags or even a reproducible code sample don't help
728,2019-02-14T09:06:23.591500,Karoline,I disagree - tags yes - but reproducible code samples are often helpful.  If you'd like to create a TLDR; version that'd be a welcome submission though.  Or even a PySlackers version of the SO with a TLDR at the top or something.
728,2019-02-14T09:07:13.592800,Karoline,"If you'd like to offer up some ideas for an improved document, head over to <#CD60CDU7K|community>"
728,2019-02-14T09:07:21.593000,Jonas,"The problem is that the people who ask the bad questions often struggle to create a sample code. I'm just suggesting that we make a tl;dr on _how to ask a question *on slack*_, not how to create a reproducible code sample from your LOB app that has nested calls arms deep and you have no idea what the issue even is let alone how to extract the code"
728,2019-02-14T09:07:46.593400,Jonas,Once the question is phrased correctly it can often be answered without code. A specific type of problem needs a code sample
728,2019-02-14T09:24:28.593800,Ashley,"The task should actually be pretty easy and straightforward, so don't overthink it :wink: "
728,2019-02-14T10:01:07.599400,Ashley,"<@Jonas> you're probably right in a lot of cases, but phrasing can be pretty difficult especially when your new to programming and/or aren't fluent in English. A lot of times, people are so lost that they don't even know what to ask. In those cases, a code sample can help us to understand what they're trying to ask. I 100% agree though that there should be more than just the code sample (gotta have some description of what they are having a problem with beyond ""I get this error, please help""), and I also think we should encourage them to reduce the code sample as much as possible (helps save us time reading through it and encourages the mindset of reducing the problem to its core components, which can lead to them finding the answer on their own). "
729,2019-02-14T09:23:23.593600,Ashley,"Look at the general things that function does, understand which variables are what types of objects, determine what is or is not necessary for your new function, and duplicate what that function does but for a different command with different flags"

730,2019-02-14T10:13:06.601200,Magaly,you're trying to execute a windows script on a linux machine.
730,2019-02-14T10:13:30.601700,Jimmy,might be a good first contribution from <@Elaine>:wink:
730,2019-02-14T10:15:03.602400,Mica,"ye I'm pretty chill with either link, though the second is much nicer to read and has some examples which is cool"
730,2019-02-14T10:17:33.603100,Greg,Really sorry my internet was down...so wasnt able to reply
730,2019-02-14T10:18:57.604100,Greg,I have a python script that fetches data from an API. And I want to run that script inside a docker container
730,2019-02-14T10:20:35.604700,Karoline,if the api is on the public internet then nothing changes
731,2019-02-14T11:09:12.609700,Juliane,"Hello guys, i want to create CLI tool for my Linux. Something like IP-Manager. For example: ipy add 123.456.23.1 myVps. How to start? I know how to write program. But how to build it and install as linux package?"
731,2019-02-14T11:24:00.611000,Genaro,<@Juliane> start by finding out if your VPS service has an API. from there read on how to make API calls from python and so on
731,2019-02-14T11:27:20.613100,Juliane,<@Genaro> But this script is very simple. When i type ipy add (ip) (name) i just save this data to file.txt and later i can connect with server with name not ip. For example:
731,2019-02-14T11:27:44.613600,Juliane,ipy add 123.123.123 myprojectvps
731,2019-02-14T11:28:06.614000,Juliane,ssh root@myprojectvps
731,2019-02-14T11:28:31.614300,Mica,are you asking how to package up the application for distribution?
731,2019-02-14T11:28:35.614500,Juliane,Yup
731,2019-02-14T11:28:46.614900,Mica,you could look into deploying on PyPI
731,2019-02-14T11:28:58.615300,Mica,is it a private application or are you ok with it being public?
731,2019-02-14T11:29:55.616500,Mica,<https://github.com/kennethreitz/setup.py>
731,2019-02-14T11:30:03.617000,Mica,something like this for deployment ^
731,2019-02-14T11:30:44.617700,Juliane,I m ok. But i want to use it like this: ipy add (ip) (name) not like python3 myscript.py role=add ip=123.123.123 name=myname
731,2019-02-14T11:31:00.618300,Mica,oh ok
731,2019-02-14T11:31:05.618600,Mica,hmm
731,2019-02-14T11:31:27.619500,Mica,"ye, so you'd need to look at packaging the app up using setup.py"
731,2019-02-14T11:31:30.619700,Genaro,assuming your script starts with `#/usr/bin/env python` you can do `chmod +x yourscript`. then you can start it with `./yourscript`
731,2019-02-14T11:31:45.620200,Mica,the above link should show you how to create packages at least
731,2019-02-14T11:32:21.621300,Mica,if you build and install you don't have to have the `./`
731,2019-02-14T11:32:45.621500,Juliane,"Ok thanks guys <@Genaro>, <@Mica>. You helped me a lot :smile:"
731,2019-02-14T11:33:43.622000,Mica,if you cturn it into a package you can run it like any other CLI tool :parrot_fast:
731,2019-02-14T11:33:51.622200,Mica,no worries man
731,2019-02-14T12:06:06.627400,Mica,"not sure it's possible to have two flags reliant on each other, one not just have a `is_flag` option instead?"
731,2019-02-14T12:06:56.627600,Mica,or this: <https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/options/#choice-opts>
731,2019-02-14T12:07:07.627900,Mica,have one flag where you pass a choice
731,2019-02-14T12:09:08.628500,Gregg,"No, it’s not a flag, unfortunately… it’s either `--name NAME` or `--id ID`"
731,2019-02-14T12:10:55.628700,Mica,"```

Feature Switches

In addition to boolean flags, there are also feature switches. These are implemented by setting multiple options to the same parameter name and defining a flag value. Note that by providing the flag_value parameter, Click will implicitly set is_flag=True.

To set a default flag, assign a value of True to the flag that should be the default.

import sys

@click.command()
@click.option('--upper', 'transformation', flag_value='upper',
              default=True)
@click.option('--lower', 'transformation', flag_value='lower')
def info(transformation):
    click.echo(getattr(sys.platform, transformation)())

And on the command line:

$ info --upper
LINUX
$ info --lower
linux
$ info
LINUX

```"

731,2019-02-14T12:12:23.629300,Gregg,"Yeah, I read that, it’s not my use-case since it’s not a flag, I need to pass a name or an id"
731,2019-02-14T12:12:48.629900,Gregg,I think I can adapt `MutexOption` for my case though
731,2019-02-14T12:13:01.630100,Mica,"yh i have no idea, sorry ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
731,2019-02-14T12:23:57.630200,Jonas,"Looks really good, I don't think it's perfect but it is better than the current one"

731,2019-02-14T14:21:27.636300,Mica,pretty sure they're the same
731,2019-02-14T14:21:53.636700,Izola,thanks for the quick response! I'll check 'er out
731,2019-02-14T14:27:30.637000,Mica,no worries!
731,2019-02-14T14:27:34.637200,Mica,checked it should be right
732,2019-02-14T12:03:49.626500,Gregg,"Hi, does anyone know or have any pointers on having a *one_of* required parameters with Click ?
I mean, something like this:
```
$ python main.py -a
ok 
$ python main.py -b
ok
$ python main.py -a -b
Error: a is mutually exclusive with b
```
which is possible with something like <https://stackoverflow.com/a/37491504/227103>

however, I would like this behavior as well:
```
$ python main.py
Error: You need one of options -a or -b
```"
732,2019-02-14T12:25:44.630400,Jonas,"Honestly, just a response with something like:
1. Explain _what_ doesn't work
2. Provide as much detail as possible. Leave things that are not directly relevant to the problem you are facing.
3. Post a code sample if possible
4. Explain what you have done to debug this issue so far

and then a link to that page would be good"

734,2019-02-14T14:48:02.641100,Claudine,i always hit enter before finishing my example

734,2019-02-14T14:48:40.642200,Chiquita,let me see if understand this..
734,2019-02-14T14:48:50.642600,Claudine,in my example you just loop over each url and call `socket.gethostbyname()` on each one and that function will return the IP address of that URL
734,2019-02-14T14:49:06.643200,Claudine,and then you just gotta put the domain and the IP together
734,2019-02-14T14:49:24.643600,Chiquita,you made a new dictionary by iterating through each domain and getting the info.. so if I look at domain_ips it will be all the info.
734,2019-02-14T14:49:35.644000,Chiquita,I think :wink:
734,2019-02-14T14:49:48.644300,Claudine,"yea oops i forgot to append `output` to `domain_ips` though, just added that"
734,2019-02-14T14:49:58.644600,Jimmy,There is probably a `dns` module in python
734,2019-02-14T14:50:17.645500,Jimmy,because a hostname could have multiple ip
734,2019-02-14T14:50:18.645800,Claudine,"yea probably, if you're trying to get MX records and stuff that may be better"
734,2019-02-14T14:50:29.646200,Chiquita,there is `dns_python` and `pywhois` for other stuff.
734,2019-02-14T14:50:30.646400,Jimmy,"and if you want MX etc, might be easier to directly start with dns"

735,2019-02-14T15:42:52.657100,Claudine,python has a ggplot module :slightly_smiling_face:
735,2019-02-14T15:43:36.658000,Misha,is not
735,2019-02-14T15:43:43.658400,Misha,it's int
735,2019-02-14T15:43:53.659100,Misha,but don't know how to go about it
735,2019-02-14T15:43:56.659200,Aleshia,"Yeah, didn't see it getting used very often though...not sure why"
735,2019-02-14T15:44:04.659700,Claudine,"looks like your error says it needs a float, you may just be able to cast it to one"
735,2019-02-14T15:44:14.660300,Cherish,<@Aleshia> I’d second matplotlib. The learning curve can be tough depending on what type of visualizations you’re making. The examples/docs you’ll find will sometimes be OO version and sometimes not which can be annoying. I’ve used it quite a bit for a couple years now though and the level of control you have over it is awesome. Happy to answer any specific questions you might have
735,2019-02-14T15:44:18.660400,Claudine,`float(mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean())`
735,2019-02-14T15:44:29.660700,Misha,ok
735,2019-02-14T15:44:35.661000,Misha,let me give it a try
735,2019-02-14T15:44:46.661300,Claudine,yea I made my own wrapper class for matplotlib that automates the setup &amp; colors and stuff
735,2019-02-14T15:44:54.661600,Claudine,now it's super fast to make charts
735,2019-02-14T15:45:15.662700,Claudine,"just a simple `line(x,y)` or `bar(x,y` and im good to go"
735,2019-02-14T15:45:38.663500,Claudine,i cant say i've done more complicated visualization though
735,2019-02-14T15:45:47.664000,Claudine,"geomapping would be my next trick, one day"
735,2019-02-14T15:46:55.666000,Cherish,I’m doing that right now actually. Which leads to a question of my own: is there a good resource explaining how to get such a module onto PyPi so other people within my company can grab it with pip? I want to make sure for some standardized data visualizations the output is the same regardless of who generates the plots
735,2019-02-14T15:47:45.667100,Claudine,i see matplotlib referenced the most so I assume it's sort of a defacto standard
735,2019-02-14T15:48:40.668800,Misha,<@Claudine> I got this error `TypeError: float() takes at most 1 argument (2 given)`
735,2019-02-14T15:50:51.669000,Jorge,"i dont have a lof of experience with them, but seaborn and bokeh are things to check out"
735,2019-02-14T15:51:17.669500,Claudine,"huh, what's `mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()` do if you print 'er on out?"
735,2019-02-14T15:52:43.670500,Misha,I want to calculate *the mean* loan amount in 30-day loans and what is *the standard deviation* of loan amount in 90-day loans? and my answers to the nearest two decimal places.
735,2019-02-14T15:53:00.670600,Claudine,"i was just looking at seaborn and it looks cool, built on top of matplotlib but with modern aesthetics"
735,2019-02-14T15:53:27.671000,Claudine,"sorry poor wording, i meant what is output of printing `mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()`"
735,2019-02-14T15:53:52.671600,Claudine,if `float()` thinks `mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()` has two values
735,2019-02-14T15:55:52.671700,Misha,None
735,2019-02-14T15:57:51.672700,Claudine,"oh yea i see, i may have lead you astray, `round(float(mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean(), 2)).iloc[1,1]` maybe"
735,2019-02-14T15:58:07.673200,Claudine,well
735,2019-02-14T15:58:09.673400,Claudine,no
735,2019-02-14T15:58:40.674500,Claudine,"`mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean()` is that whole table, if you want to round one of the values you have to call `round` on a single value"
735,2019-02-14T15:59:29.676300,Claudine,"if `.iloc[1,1]` is intended to grab that one value you'll have to move that inside your `round()` call"
735,2019-02-14T15:59:41.676900,Misha,Ok
735,2019-02-14T15:59:55.677300,Claudine,"`round(float(mywork.groupby('TermDays').mean().iloc[1,1]), 2)` maybe"
735,2019-02-14T16:00:02.677600,Misha,Ok
735,2019-02-14T16:00:33.678300,Cherish,"Oh, also touching on your point about interactive plots <@Aleshia> -- I recently found the `mpld3` library. This is super convenient for sharing visualizations (2D support only) that are still interactive. You can save a `matplotlib` `Figure` to an HTML file using `mpld3.save_html(figure, 'filename.html')`, that others can then open up and interact with the data in the same way they would if they generated the figure themselves:"
735,2019-02-14T16:00:47.678700,Claudine,"oh by the way it'd probably be best to keep this in one channel, i see we're splitting this across here and <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science> . No need to repeat question in multiple channels"
735,2019-02-14T16:02:32.679300,Misha,Ok <@Claudine>....Thanks it worked... YIPPEE
735,2019-02-14T16:02:56.679500,Claudine,nice
735,2019-02-14T16:03:04.679900,Claudine,hit me with a taco :pacman:
735,2019-02-14T16:03:36.680700,Misha,<@Claudine> :pacman:
735,2019-02-14T16:03:48.681100,Cherish,:taco: <@Claudine> like this <@Misha>
735,2019-02-14T16:03:48.681200,Misha,lol
735,2019-02-14T16:03:54.681400,Claudine,ha thanks
735,2019-02-14T16:04:02.681700,Claudine,yea just @ my name and then add a taco emoji
735,2019-02-14T16:04:10.681900,Claudine,i do it all for the taco
735,2019-02-14T16:05:54.682300,Misha,:pacman:<@Claudine>
735,2019-02-14T16:06:38.682600,Misha,novice me :disappointed:
735,2019-02-14T16:06:48.682900,Claudine,lol no no :taco:  not :pacman:
735,2019-02-14T16:07:06.683600,Claudine,dont worry haha
735,2019-02-14T16:07:14.683800,Claudine,it's just internet points for fun
735,2019-02-14T16:07:27.684100,Ashley,<@Claudine> :taco:
735,2019-02-14T16:07:56.684600,Ashley,or you can also react with :taco:  on the person's message
735,2019-02-14T16:08:40.685300,Ashley,"welp, nevermind on the reacting bit. could have sworn I read that somewhere haha"
735,2019-02-14T16:09:30.686200,Misha,<@Claudine> :taco:
735,2019-02-14T16:10:11.686900,Ashley,"<@Misha> we give tacos as rewards for help or general awesomeness, and those who receive them consume them with :pacman: (usually as a reaction on the message that gave the taco). And you have 5 tacos to give out every day"
735,2019-02-14T16:10:19.687100,Ashley,exactly
735,2019-02-14T16:10:50.687400,Misha,Pls how do i go about the *the standard deviation* of loan amount in 90-day loans? and my answers to the nearest two decimal places.
735,2019-02-14T16:11:48.688200,Ashley,"that is more of a statistics question, than a python one. I would hit up khan academy. they probably have some good video tutorials on how to calculate that"
735,2019-02-14T16:12:33.688800,Misha,Thanks <@Ashley>
735,2019-02-14T16:12:41.689000,Ashley,:+1:
735,2019-02-14T16:12:56.689400,Misha,pls i still need to solve this
735,2019-02-14T16:13:32.689700,Hiroko,is this a homework question?
735,2019-02-14T16:13:39.689900,Misha,yes
735,2019-02-14T16:13:44.690300,Claudine,heh
735,2019-02-14T16:13:54.690700,Hiroko,"ok, we’ll be happy to help you when you show something you’ve tried"
735,2019-02-14T16:14:01.691100,Hiroko,"but actually doing the work, no"
735,2019-02-14T16:14:17.691700,Misha,I have work 1-3 by myself
735,2019-02-14T16:14:58.692300,Misha,I can send the screenshot
735,2019-02-14T16:16:05.693200,Claudine,if you're not sure of the formula for calculating standard deviation it's not to hard to learn by googling
735,2019-02-14T16:16:20.693700,Misha,This is just my 3wks into to the learning
735,2019-02-14T16:16:23.694000,Claudine,"you can search for how to do it in python specifically, but it'd be worth understanding the math behind it"
735,2019-02-14T16:16:54.694700,Misha,And I joined a group for fun
735,2019-02-14T16:17:12.695200,Misha,and picked up a work from them to start solving
735,2019-02-14T16:17:34.695700,Misha,I also googled out group to join to learn more
735,2019-02-14T16:18:14.696900,Misha,sometimes reading and watching thousands of materials and tuts without hands on is wasting of time
735,2019-02-14T16:19:12.697900,Misha,i'm NOT just using this group to solve my lesson but bringing errors that i encountered
735,2019-02-14T16:19:19.698100,Misha,Thanks <@Claudine>
735,2019-02-14T16:19:57.698900,Carlota,"I'm new to Python but not as a developer.  Here, I'm using a library to create an aws `cloudformation` stack.  I want to replace the `eks_cluster_name` for the `ClusterName`.  Apparently, I can't because the data types are different."
735,2019-02-14T16:20:02.699300,Claudine,"no problem, you could also check out the python module `numpy` which had built in methods for calulcating standard deviation along a specific axis"
735,2019-02-14T16:20:22.699900,Claudine,it's been awhile since i've done any statistical work so I'm not sure myself off the top of my head
735,2019-02-14T16:20:46.700400,Claudine,"`numpy` might be a little unwiedly if you're new to python, it was for me when i started"
735,2019-02-14T16:21:37.700900,Claudine,<@Carlota> do you know the expected data type and what the data type of `eks_cluster_name` are?
735,2019-02-14T16:22:31.701400,Misha,"`round(float(mywork.groupby('TermDays').std().iloc[4,1]), 2)`"
735,2019-02-14T16:22:50.701900,Misha,I tried this and it worked
735,2019-02-14T16:24:30.704600,Carlota,"<@Claudine> the data type for the ```    eks_cluster_name = ImportValue(Sub('${VPCStackName}::EKSClusterName'))
```
the response is a string while it is substituting some of the parameters.  For example, the `${BootstrapArguments}` will be replaced with the parameters passed in the stack."
735,2019-02-14T16:25:02.705400,Hiroko,"<@Misha> when it comes to homework questions, you’ll get much better responses when you show what you’ve done and ask a question, or describe your current understanding and what you’re unsure about"
735,2019-02-14T16:25:11.705700,Hiroko,rather than asking “how do I solve this problem”
735,2019-02-14T16:25:49.706800,Hiroko,"it may very well be a language barrier, and you didn’t mean it that way.  but that is a little how you did come across."
735,2019-02-14T16:26:02.707400,Claudine,<@Carlota> oh i was curious if `print(type(eks_cluster_name)` was `str`
735,2019-02-14T16:26:02.707500,Hiroko,"and if my interpretation is incorrect, then I apologize"
735,2019-02-14T16:26:27.707900,Misha,I think 1 is for row  and 4 for  column
735,2019-02-14T16:26:36.708200,Misha,yes <@Hiroko>
735,2019-02-14T16:27:17.709000,Misha,I'm a working professional (12yrs in media production) and running a small tech startup
735,2019-02-14T16:28:42.710700,Misha,And I just think it will be of good benefit to dive into Data Science and I just started 3wks ago
735,2019-02-14T16:29:34.712000,Misha,And I pick up a lesson note online by myself to start solving
735,2019-02-14T16:30:13.712900,Misha,now i'm encoutering some prob and i need human being to explain something to me...lol:grinning:
735,2019-02-14T16:33:14.714900,Misha,Nevertheless thanks for the advise <@Hiroko>
735,2019-02-14T16:43:13.724300,Cherish,"<@Marc> that'll happen on your last iteration because `s[ind]` will be grabbing your last value, so `s[ind + 1]` will be out of range. You need to check for that before trying to access `s[ind + 1]`"
735,2019-02-14T16:43:33.724600,Misha,"My lesson 5

*Late* loans are defined as loans that were paid *more than 3 days* after their due date. Please find the average number of days that these loans were paid beyond their due date for each *week of the year*. This will require you to break all *appilcationDate's* down into the week of the year they were made and then perform a group by.

What is the average number of days that *late* loans applied for in the second week of the year were paid late? Please sumbit your answer rounded to two decimal places.

Now These are my code

# week of year and average number of late days
`Late = mywork[mywork['dateDifference'] &gt; pd.Timedelta('3 days')]`
`Late`

-------- No Issues--------

Then I was at the point of breaking them down into weeks when I encoutered this

`Late['appilcationDate'] = Late['appilcationDate'].dt.week`

735,2019-02-14T16:44:47.726500,Ashley,"<@Marc> it does, but then you ask it to go one further than the end"
735,2019-02-14T16:45:30.727400,Cherish,"Yes, if there's X elements in `s`, ie the length of `s`, then on the last iteration of your loop, `ind` will be equal to X, and `ind + 1` will be &gt; X"
735,2019-02-14T16:47:59.731300,Cherish,"Yeah basically that. There's multiple ways you can accomplish it, but what you have captures the premise of what you need to do"
736,2019-02-14T16:26:16.707700,Carlota,"oh, let me check"

736,2019-02-14T16:40:30.720900,Marc,newbie question but im iterating over a string and trying to compare a character in the string to its next character
736,2019-02-14T16:40:36.721100,Marc,and im using index + 1 but im getting out of range?
736,2019-02-14T16:40:55.721200,Marc,None
736,2019-02-14T16:44:14.725700,Marc,<@Cherish> - what do you mean it will be grabbing my last value? You mean it doesn't know it's the end of the index when I enumerate? I have to tell it that there's only x indexes in the string?
736,2019-02-14T16:46:20.728500,Marc,so something like
736,2019-02-14T16:46:34.728600,Ashley,<@Marc> try this and you'll see how many times it actually goes through the loop. What is inside the loop is irrelevant to how it loops
736,2019-02-14T16:46:42.728900,Marc,None
736,2019-02-14T16:47:00.729600,Ashley,more or less
736,2019-02-14T16:47:06.730100,Marc,yeah it iterates however many times the length of my string is
736,2019-02-14T16:47:10.730200,Ashley,you can just call `continue` in that case
736,2019-02-14T16:47:21.730600,Ashley,there's a simpler way though
736,2019-02-14T16:48:24.731600,Marc,okay
736,2019-02-14T16:48:46.732400,Marc,It's a bit demoralizing when leetcode problems are tagged as easy and I struggle with them :stuck_out_tongue:

736,2019-02-14T16:49:20.733200,Marc,<@Ashley> - what would you say the easier way is?
736,2019-02-14T16:51:24.734100,Ashley,"maybe not easier depending on your perspective, but to get you thinking about lists and iterating, here's a fancy approach"
736,2019-02-14T16:51:38.734500,Marc,oh god
736,2019-02-14T16:51:40.734800,Marc,lol

736,2019-02-14T16:51:55.735200,Ashley,zip is actually pretty straightforward
736,2019-02-14T16:52:21.735700,Ashley,try printing out `s[:-1]` and then `s[1:]` to see what they are individually
736,2019-02-14T16:52:27.736000,Ashley,then print out the zip of them

`Late`"
738,2019-02-14T17:16:58.743300,Marc,and im sure theres a better way than that
738,2019-02-14T17:17:18.743500,Ashley,it also doesn't have to be `1`
738,2019-02-14T17:17:57.743600,Misha,None
738,2019-02-14T17:18:10.744100,Marc,Yeah you can step by by 2's
738,2019-02-14T17:18:16.744200,Misha,"`Late['dateDifference'] = Late['dateDifference'].dt.days`

`Late`"
738,2019-02-14T17:18:25.744500,Misha,And I got the above errors
738,2019-02-14T17:18:44.744800,Marc,is dateDifference a datetime value or a string?
738,2019-02-14T17:19:01.745200,Marc,print(type(dateDifference))
738,2019-02-14T17:20:23.745600,Marc,fyi pepi 8 says you shoudnt use snakeCase variable names
738,2019-02-14T17:20:28.745800,Marc,should be date_difference
738,2019-02-14T17:20:36.746000,Marc,pop*
738,2019-02-14T17:20:44.746200,Marc,ugh pep*
738,2019-02-14T17:21:39.747300,Marth,"good to know <@Marc> re: snakeCase.  Also...in case you didn't know, you should be able to press the up arrow on your keyboard to edit your last post.  EDIT:  SEE!!  :slightly_smiling_face:"
738,2019-02-14T17:22:08.748200,Marc,snakeCase is usually used for Class names
738,2019-02-14T17:22:11.748400,Misha,is a string (25 days) but I need to remove the (days) and leave only the value
738,2019-02-14T17:22:31.748900,Marc,<@Misha> then that is why it's not working because you cant use .dt on strings
738,2019-02-14T17:23:41.749100,Misha,hmmm
738,2019-02-14T17:23:48.749400,Misha,pls how do go about it
738,2019-02-14T17:23:57.749700,Misha,newbie in the room pls
738,2019-02-14T17:24:10.749900,Marc,You're just trying to see if the values are equal?
738,2019-02-14T17:24:27.750200,Marc,can you post the relevant block of code?
738,2019-02-14T17:26:26.750600,Marc,or youre assigning the days to the dateDifference?
738,2019-02-14T17:28:32.750800,Misha,ok
738,2019-02-14T17:29:55.750900,Misha,None
738,2019-02-14T17:31:04.751200,Misha,None
738,2019-02-14T17:31:51.751900,Misha,<@Marc> did you get it
738,2019-02-14T17:32:44.752100,Marc,"Yeah, I see"
738,2019-02-14T17:33:21.752600,Marc,"I'm kind of a newb too, especially when it comes to pandas"
738,2019-02-14T17:33:28.752900,Marc,but it looks like to you have to_datetime method there
738,2019-02-14T17:33:29.753200,Marc,that you can call

738,2019-02-14T17:35:02.755400,Marc,I mean the +
738,2019-02-14T17:35:05.755700,Marc,you can add code snippets

738,2019-02-14T17:36:50.757300,Misha,Ok
738,2019-02-14T17:36:56.757500,Cherish,"you can also triple backtick for short snippets, ie `x3 follow by 3 more at the end of the snippet"

738,2019-02-14T17:44:22.760300,Misha,The dateDifference is given me 1 on all column
738,2019-02-14T17:44:33.760600,Misha,I think there is error
738,2019-02-14T17:56:02.761600,Misha,Let me go back to read up more.... and find another challenge for myself...lol

741,2019-02-14T20:14:39.773800,Hai,great. is it possible to see the percentage of 'b' in 'a' ?
741,2019-02-14T20:15:19.774100,Sasha,`percent = b / a * 100`
741,2019-02-14T20:16:09.774500,Hai,am getting '0' no matter what value i give for b

746,2019-02-15T05:09:54.800500,Waldo,Anyone pretty hot on creating data frames? I have a dictionary of dictionaries I am wanting to create a clean data frame from
746,2019-02-15T05:10:18.800700,Mica,"yo, what are you planning to do?"
746,2019-02-15T05:10:23.800900,Waldo,None
746,2019-02-15T05:10:36.801500,Waldo,I have the above dynamically created dictonary
746,2019-02-15T05:11:01.802100,Waldo,"Basically looking at sales by day, by sku with each sku having qty sold and revenue"
746,2019-02-15T05:12:17.802500,Mica,"ok, do you know what you want the DF to look like?"
746,2019-02-15T05:12:17.802600,Waldo,None
746,2019-02-15T05:12:32.803300,Waldo,My dataframe looks like that so far when I try: pd.DataFrame.from_dict(order_sheet)
746,2019-02-15T05:13:27.804100,Waldo,I always get a little confused on the base structure of the raw data and not even sure if the dictionary structure is the right way of doing this!
746,2019-02-15T05:13:55.804700,Mica,"so to generate a DF from a dict, you need a dict with an individual key andall of the values to be a list"
746,2019-02-15T05:14:19.804900,Waldo,so date as the key
746,2019-02-15T05:14:29.805200,Waldo,"Then individual lists for the sku, qty and rev?"
746,2019-02-15T05:15:07.805500,Waldo,so a list of lists as the date key value?
746,2019-02-15T05:17:07.806300,Mica,I'd remove Sales into a separate DF
746,2019-02-15T05:17:30.806800,Mica,so you'd have a dict of date:sales_df
746,2019-02-15T05:18:14.807600,Waldo,slightly confused... how would that look?
746,2019-02-15T05:18:34.808100,Mica,"with sales being `DataFrame.from_dict({MV1-XMNY18_revenue: [], MV1-XMNY18_qty: [], MV1-STL_revenue:[], MV1-STL_qty: [], ...})`"
746,2019-02-15T05:18:45.808300,Mica,that would be a sales DF
746,2019-02-15T05:18:49.808600,Waldo,ok
746,2019-02-15T05:19:02.809000,Mica,then you have a dict with the key (date) pointing to the value (sales DF)
746,2019-02-15T05:19:47.809300,Mica,acitally wait wait
746,2019-02-15T05:19:58.809600,Mica,if you have another column for date you could putthem all in the same DF
746,2019-02-15T05:20:27.810000,Waldo,that is what I was thinking
746,2019-02-15T05:20:34.810300,Waldo,"Hence being a bit confused, sorry!"
746,2019-02-15T05:21:22.810400,Mica,None
746,2019-02-15T05:21:27.810800,Mica,etc etc.
746,2019-02-15T05:21:33.811100,Mica,my bad i was being silly :stuck_out_tongue:
746,2019-02-15T05:22:09.812200,Waldo,ok so effectively split out each metric as sku_metricname and have lists

746,2019-02-15T05:24:18.815500,Waldo,Sorry - product codes
746,2019-02-15T05:24:40.815900,Mica,you could put in default stubs and then update
746,2019-02-15T05:24:49.816100,Waldo,yup ok
746,2019-02-15T05:25:37.816700,Mica,also there are more experienced individuals than me in <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science> might get more advanced responses :stuck_out_tongue:

747,2019-02-15T07:07:38.820800,Ji,"does any one know if there is an automatic code review tool to detect bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in your code. It can integrate with your existing workflow to enable continuous code inspection across your project branches and pull requests (code here is done using pyspark and sparksql)"
747,2019-02-15T07:09:19.821200,Mica,"code smells you could use something like mypy, black. pep8, isort. etc"
747,2019-02-15T07:09:48.822000,Mica,"as for detecting bugs, you could always run tests in the CI?"
747,2019-02-15T07:10:20.822200,Hiroko,automatic?  no
747,2019-02-15T07:10:41.822700,Hiroko,"run tests in CI, use linting tools to enforce agreed upon convention"
747,2019-02-15T07:10:59.823000,Hiroko,but actual code review?  how would that work?
747,2019-02-15T07:11:38.823900,Jonas,I'd say you haven't installed it correctly then :smile:
747,2019-02-15T07:11:54.824400,Hiroko,how would you determine a less than optimimal approach or a possible better structure?  suggesting documentation?
747,2019-02-15T07:11:54.824500,Jonas,If you paste the command you're running to install it and the output we can give you a hand
747,2019-02-15T07:13:00.825000,Hiroko,"if you want code analysis, there’s sonarqube"
747,2019-02-15T07:13:01.825200,Hiroko,<https://www.sonarqube.org/>
747,2019-02-15T07:13:29.826500,Hiroko,but not sure how well it would work for dynamic languages like python.  I know it works best with static types like java/c#/etc
747,2019-02-15T07:14:00.827300,Karoline,"I usually run black, pyflakes, and mypy and then there is manual review"
747,2019-02-15T07:14:03.827400,Ji,"I am using Sonarqube in golang. But i have not used in pyspark.
For python also there is a plugin. I have not tested it"
747,2019-02-15T07:14:38.828000,Hiroko,"true, but there’s always going to be limitations because of the dynamic nature of the language, particularly if you’re not using typings or mypy"
747,2019-02-15T07:15:47.828600,Hiroko,are you using manual code review in addition to this?
747,2019-02-15T07:17:15.829400,Ji,Yes i am doing a manual code review. But sometimes when you write the code you might end up with cognitive complexity.
747,2019-02-15T07:17:34.829900,Ji,so i want to highlight such things for later refactor
747,2019-02-15T07:20:49.830900,Karoline,I don't know how much a tool can really help with that.  I mean there's things like mccabe complexity checking - but especially if it's simply advisory and going to be dealt with later I dunno how much having that as an automatic part of a PR would help
747,2019-02-15T07:23:20.832900,Ji,when i said i would later refactor. it is not left like that. I would address this as soon as possible. you are right using the tool seems useless
747,2019-02-15T07:23:29.833200,Karoline,If I'm using an automated tool in my PRs it's usually to give me a yes/no answer.
747,2019-02-15T07:24:16.834100,Karoline,especially just because they avoid argument.  the worst thing is getting people disagreeing about how important something is and a PR dragging on about what should/shouldn't be fixed.
747,2019-02-15T07:29:13.837600,Ji,"Yes you can use it against every PR but then it becomes an overhead (All PR is done by manual reivew, which is enough).
I would rather keep it simple get the things running and then refactor code based on complexity and performance.
The main usecase for me is to highlight writing a shitty code gives us pain in the end and force people to create better quality (i believe people learn faster when they see something :slightly_smiling_face: )."
747,2019-02-15T07:30:19.838600,Hiroko,is that shitty code fairly visible in review or when working on tickets?
747,2019-02-15T07:31:04.840000,Hiroko,"eg, when you’re working on a ticket and you come across X thing that could be done better.  why not file a ticket for that, especially if you have a tech debt epic/bucket"
747,2019-02-15T07:31:30.840700,Hiroko,and then you can allocate 10-20% of your team’s weekly work to cleaning up those kind of tickets
747,2019-02-15T07:32:11.841700,Ji,I do agree with you <@Hiroko> that is the best approach. But sometime some slip through.
747,2019-02-15T07:32:26.841900,Karoline,that's going to happen
747,2019-02-15T07:33:09.843200,Ji,So such tooling which just give me overview helps me catch those
747,2019-02-15T07:33:17.843700,Hiroko,and are you sure you’re going to get a higher signal to noise ratio with thoe tools?
747,2019-02-15T07:33:19.843900,Ji,I believe SonarQube does that
747,2019-02-15T07:33:26.844100,Karoline,"I'd say throw the linters and mccabe at it, and use those to gate new PRs.  And anything beyond that is realistically going to have to come from the culture of your dev team"
747,2019-02-15T07:33:54.844600,Hiroko,and project managers too
747,2019-02-15T07:34:49.845700,Ji,i just want to help dev team :wink: . Project managers are whole different species :smile:
747,2019-02-15T07:35:25.846800,Hiroko,PMs really should help the dev team and be the interface between devs and stakeholders
747,2019-02-15T07:35:31.847000,Karoline,"I mean they list their ""code smells"" - <https://rules.sonarsource.com/python/type/Code%20Smell/RSPEC-124>"
747,2019-02-15T07:35:37.847500,Hiroko,"if theyre not doing that, there’s a bigger problem"
747,2019-02-15T07:35:45.847700,Karoline,"I'm unimpressed with what it does beyond the normal linter, to be honest"
747,2019-02-15T07:36:14.848100,Hiroko,files should not have too many lines of code?
747,2019-02-15T07:36:25.848600,Hiroko,doesn’t really state what the limit is
747,2019-02-15T07:36:43.849000,Ji,Thanks guys i will try to keep it simple and do it with linters for start
747,2019-02-15T07:37:02.849500,Hiroko,cognitive complexity… would be interesting how that’s determined
747,2019-02-15T07:37:08.849800,Karoline,use the linters and don't make them advisory.  fail PRs that linting
747,2019-02-15T07:37:28.850100,Karoline,<@Hiroko> my guess is they just run mccabe
747,2019-02-15T07:37:33.850300,Hiroko,<https://www.sonarsource.com/docs/CognitiveComplexity.pdf>
747,2019-02-15T07:37:50.850600,Hiroko,looks to be built off mccabe
747,2019-02-15T07:38:26.850900,Karoline,a lot of this just seems to be built off of the existing linters really
747,2019-02-15T07:58:28.853300,Karoline,"another thing I'll add, and I hope I'm not beating a dead horse here, but it's coming a up a lot as I get deeper into the new place I'm at so it's on my mind - anything automated to tell you things that isn't designed to require a response is destined to be ignored.  my prediction is if this is just an advisory thing on your PRs, people start out peeking at what it says, but will begin to ignore it as they realize it has no bearing on whether their work gets merged or not."
747,2019-02-15T07:58:43.853700,Karoline,"worse - they may internalized its continued griping about their ""shitty code"" and get demoralized."
747,2019-02-15T07:59:21.854200,Karoline,so if you want to integrate tools like this into CI - make failing the tool fail CI
747,2019-02-15T08:21:57.861200,Ji,"Yes you are right people will get demoralised if flagged every single time.
In go project which i worked with we used this check (like a  good to have), not to flag things as shitty code.
Like you said before we sit as a team we take a look into code smell and remove it before moving it into production. I am taking that learning into the new project but this is in pyspark and spark sql. So i wanted to know if Sonarqube is the most recommended or just use the basic linter.
I did realize dev team who is in this is not used to these toolings and code quality. So it is a thin line for making people frustrated."
747,2019-02-15T08:23:10.862000,Karoline,"Yeah it can be especially tough working with data science stuff, the expectations for developers there are often different.  I think it's good to do what you are doing though and trying to bring up the code quality"
748,2019-02-15T08:06:29.854300,Arturo,Managed to get it working. The import name was wrong
749,2019-02-15T09:03:52.865700,Bethany,"Funny thing, I just talked to two people from the same department. 1) the pyspark queries were slow so I converted them to use mostly SQL since then only the SQL statements need to be transferred. 2) the codebase was all in pyspark using just SQL statements and was unmaintainable so I converted it to python statements"
749,2019-02-15T09:04:04.865900,Bethany,So don't do that
749,2019-02-15T09:05:25.868000,Ashley,"Yeah. You'll have to work the problem backwards a little bit. Just look at how it builds the command it wants to run, and try to mimic that process"
749,2019-02-15T09:05:49.868800,Bethany,I can't imagine a tool will be able to tell you anything helpful beyond Flake8 + mypy + formatter (black/yapf).

```
def sum_many_lists(*lists) -&gt; List[Number]:

it works when I pass in multiple lists inline:
```
sum_many_lists([1,2], [3,4])
&gt; [4, 6]
```
I'm trying to pass in a list of lists using list unpacking, like so:
```
lists = [[1,2], [3,4]]
sum_many_lists(*lists)
&gt; TypeError: zip argument #1 must support iteration
```
How can I support the second scenario?"

761,2019-02-16T22:12:04.936700,Corey,"Hi All, While perusing content from a few different Python courses, I've noticed two distinct patterns in code to deal with default values being assigned to attributes in a class definitions. (refer to the snippet provided)

In the first case, class definition Object_One, a method variable is assigned None. This value is then assigned to the object's attribute upon instantiation.

In the second case, class definition Object_Two, there is no use of a method variable nor the conditional statement reassigning the attribute a value.

In both cases though, when instantiating the two objects and printing the two attributes with and without a value being passed during objects creation, the values are the same. So, the BIG question aside from the probing one asked by the Troll near the Bridge of Death is... what's the difference? Is one version more widely accepted? <#C07EW4DNE|learning_python>"

763,2019-02-17T15:11:06.955900,Gianna,<@Bethany> i think you are rit but how i can fixed it here is my output
763,2019-02-17T15:11:28.956200,Gianna,None
763,2019-02-17T15:22:22.956800,Gianna,<@Bethany> i try with this but does not work :disappointed: `pipenv --python path/to/anaconda/bin/python`
763,2019-02-17T15:23:04.957100,Bethany,"you're using conda, pyenv and pipenv?"
763,2019-02-17T15:23:40.957500,Gianna,i am confuse really
763,2019-02-17T15:23:53.958000,Gianna,u see this
763,2019-02-17T15:23:55.958300,Gianna,"```which python
/Users/alif/.pyenv/shims/python```"
763,2019-02-17T15:23:57.958400,Bethany,i can imagine! I'm confused. They all have overlapping things
763,2019-02-17T15:24:03.958700,Bethany,yes
763,2019-02-17T15:24:09.958900,Bethany,I've never used pyenv so I don't know what that's doing
763,2019-02-17T15:24:28.959200,Bethany,what does the prompt say when you do `python`
763,2019-02-17T15:25:20.960000,Gianna,i think if you use `pyenv` u can use multi python version
763,2019-02-17T15:25:32.960300,Bethany,yes but conda does that too
763,2019-02-17T15:25:41.960700,Bethany,so I imagine that is a source of confusion
763,2019-02-17T15:25:50.961100,Gianna,so should i delete all then install again
763,2019-02-17T15:26:03.961300,Bethany,honestly might be easiest
763,2019-02-17T15:26:07.961600,Bethany,only use conda for example
763,2019-02-17T15:26:10.961900,Bethany,or only use pyenv
763,2019-02-17T15:26:18.962200,Gianna,then what is my 1st
763,2019-02-17T15:26:18.962300,Bethany,but don't do that just yet
763,2019-02-17T15:26:28.962700,Bethany,type `python` what do you see
763,2019-02-17T15:26:42.963000,Gianna,but if use pyenv i cant use anaconda yes?

765,2019-02-17T16:34:06.984000,Hiroko,my guess is flask and event loops don’t play nicely with each other

768,2019-02-18T02:30:49.995700,Waldo,Insert what the name of the environment you want in place of `&lt;name of shell&gt;`
768,2019-02-18T02:32:05.996100,Waldo,So in the above try running `conda init anaconda3`
768,2019-02-18T02:32:26.996300,Waldo,Then `conda activate anaconda3`
768,2019-02-18T03:00:59.997300,Idell,man u should first show ur full stack trace or else we cant help u

768,2019-02-18T03:18:19.997600,Waldo,So `conda init anaconda_test`
768,2019-02-18T03:18:40.997800,Waldo,Then `conda activate anaconda_test`
768,2019-02-18T03:47:47.998200,Waldo,running `conda activate &lt;name&gt;` runs a an anaconda environment

769,2019-02-18T05:51:33.001100,Vanita,yup

769,2019-02-18T05:52:25.002200,Vanita,"it doesn’t have to be a decorator, i’m just trying to identify a way of reaching into a subset of functions and return information about them. a way of adding a descriptor or tag really to each one"
769,2019-02-18T05:52:36.002700,Chester,You should really return these values explicitly
769,2019-02-18T05:53:36.003600,Mica,"depends what you mean by information, not sure you could pull varaible values, without a huge amount of work, but you could potentially monitor stuff like runtime and memory usage :thinking_face:"
769,2019-02-18T05:53:39.003800,Vanita,I don’t believe I’ve a way of over riding the function class for my use case unfortunately
769,2019-02-18T05:55:00.005500,Vanita,"Sorry, I should explain what I’m trying to do. I’ve a flask app being built thats gonna have a _fairly_ large codebase with a LOT of routes. I know they have `flask routes` through `click` which returns all the routes but you only really get the route, function name and the method. I’d love more info outside of “More descriptive function names”"
769,2019-02-18T05:55:50.006500,Vanita,initially I thought of trying to see could I modify the `@app.route()` decorator to have a `desc` or similar argument that would be pulled somehow but I guess I need to figure out what `flask routes` is calling first
769,2019-02-18T05:57:22.007400,Mica,so you want to extend the existing `flask routes` command?
769,2019-02-18T05:57:31.007800,Mica,so you can also display a description
769,2019-02-18T05:57:39.008000,Vanita,"or use another command, it doesn’t have to extend"
769,2019-02-18T05:58:24.008700,Lorinda,Thanks for the continues support on the matter! So the command is the hackrf_spiflash -r and I will need to find out how it is build in order to recreate the process and then call this command?
769,2019-02-18T05:58:35.009000,Mica,"hmm ok, I'm guessing you'd want to pull the endpoint docs or something? hmm ye that sounds like it'd be a huge amount of work haha :sweat_smile:"
769,2019-02-18T05:58:59.009400,Lorinda,How I can find how it builds the command? In your experience what my angle should be in order to find that info for hackrf_spiflash -r?
769,2019-02-18T06:03:49.010600,Vanita,"honestly its just a string that’ll exist on that endpoint, I know theres a `app.url_map.iter_rules()` but i don’t know enough Python to know if I can extend that or not (or how that’d work tbh)"
769,2019-02-18T06:21:25.010900,Jettie,sure you can
769,2019-02-18T06:26:12.012000,Jettie,"you can make a decorator that would do `blueprint.add_route`, and then also take a `desc` argument (and possibly more) and store it in your own dict (like url_map)"
769,2019-02-18T06:30:47.012600,Vanita,"oh so instead of calling `app.route`, I’d wrap that and give it my own? Interesting!"

Like I said, aside from the `subprocess` and `QtCore` stuff, it's working with standard python objects, so it should be easy to follow what it does. You can either throw in a bunch of print statements between each alone, or try out pdb so you can hang out in there and keep trying stuff without having to keep calling the script over and over"

775,2019-02-18T10:51:05.027100,Jonas,tl;dr it's pretty much just automagically drawing any line on any graph
775,2019-02-18T10:51:21.027400,Jonas,and from that line you can infer predictions
775,2019-02-18T10:51:54.028000,Jonas,The first two weeks of course cover that for you

778,2019-02-18T13:24:45.055000,Jonas,"So specific exclusions are fine (`if isinstance(obj, str)`)"
778,2019-02-18T13:25:00.055600,Jonas,"but in general if you want to iterate over something, check that it's iterable rather than it is a concrete type"
778,2019-02-18T13:25:09.055900,Deangelo,"I check primitive types first, so this is safe"
778,2019-02-18T13:26:29.056900,Deangelo,"so I have this:
```
if isinstance(data, Iterable):
        return _deserialize_list(data, klass) # need subclass, like float in List[float]
    elif isinstance(data, Mapping):
        return _deserialize_dict(data, klass) # need subclass here too
```"
778,2019-02-18T13:27:10.057600,Deangelo,"instead of klass, I need to fetch the sub type, in say `List[subtype]`"
778,2019-02-18T13:34:09.058400,Deangelo,"I'm having issues with isinstance(data, Iterable) and isinstance(data, Mapping)"
778,2019-02-18T13:34:56.059000,Deangelo,because I want to also support class models
778,2019-02-18T13:35:16.059300,Deangelo,"```
...
    elif isinstance(data, Mapping):
        return _deserialize_dict(data, klass)
    elif isinstance(data, Iterable):
        return _deserialize_list(data, klass)
    else:
        return deserialize_model(data, klass)
```"
778,2019-02-18T13:35:57.060200,Deangelo,the last branch `deserialize_model` never gets triggered because instances of custom classes are also of type Mapping and Iterable
778,2019-02-18T13:37:07.060500,Deangelo,"I initially had this:
```
    elif type(klass) == GenericMeta:
        if klass.__extra__ == list:
            return _deserialize_list(data, klass.__args__[0])
        if klass.__extra__ == dict:
            return _deserialize_dict(data, klass.__args__[1])
    else:
        return deserialize_model(data, klass)
```"
778,2019-02-18T13:37:27.060800,Deangelo,but it's not compatible with python 3.7
778,2019-02-18T13:40:02.062200,Clemmie,"It is a little different, but maybe you could use `functools.singledispatch` and use the logic inside the `Mapping/Iterable` function to differentiate between your models and the base types"
778,2019-02-18T14:37:14.063900,Deangelo,"I found `typing_inspect`, which can do:
```
is_generic_type(Mapping)
is_generic_type(Iterable[int])
```
I just need the import to work so I can check."

780,2019-02-18T15:05:33.069400,Clemmie,And at first glance - why do you think you need to use pandas?
780,2019-02-18T15:06:33.070600,Clemmie,"I’m happy to show you a way to deal with those as strings, but using pandas for it is a confusing requirement to me"
780,2019-02-18T15:06:40.070700,Kourtney,its a pandas dataframe.. i thought i would be able to use str.extract
780,2019-02-18T15:06:56.071100,Clemmie,"Okay, good context"
780,2019-02-18T15:07:46.072200,Clemmie,"use the snippet feature (the + next to the comment window) and show what you have so far, and if you have tried other avenues please walk through what you tried"
780,2019-02-18T15:13:31.072700,Kourtney,I came across online help where people were able to do it using str.extract.. i have also seen the str.extract library.. but the examples are bit confusing
780,2019-02-18T15:16:21.073000,Kourtney,I tried importing datetime library too. but dont know how to take the individual entries of the serise as a str type and pass it..
780,2019-02-18T15:18:05.074400,Clemmie,"So it looks like your InvoiceDate is a Series, and not a string - as far as I can tell from the briefest look and minimal experience with pandas"
780,2019-02-18T15:18:49.075400,Clemmie,you might get more help in the <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science> channel - they use a lot of pandas over there from my understanding
780,2019-02-18T15:18:50.075500,Kourtney,yeah thats correct..
780,2019-02-18T15:19:06.075800,Kourtney,okay I will try asking there.. thankyou

782,2019-02-18T15:59:35.083500,Tynisha,"Hello everyone, I have been working on an application that uses Django as a backend, but runs a different server to serve a single page application that handles it's own logic, and only references the Django api to send requests and receive Json.

I have run into a lot of trouble regarding Django's security when writing post requests. In particular, I keep getting blocked by an error saying ""(CSRF cookie not set)"" or ""(CSRF token missing or incorrect)"". The ""/at/csrf_exempt"" tag isn't solving the issue, and I can't find a working solution for setting headers in my client side code. Does anyone know a work-around so we can continue with production. We would prefer to use Django security via the token and don't want to have to build our own."
782,2019-02-18T16:01:48.083900,Jewell,Django needs a bearer token present in the request
782,2019-02-18T16:02:09.084300,Jewell,so whatever you're using for making the API calls needs to set that token
782,2019-02-18T16:02:30.084800,Jewell,`Authorization: Bearer &lt;tokenValue&gt;`
782,2019-02-18T16:06:43.086900,Tynisha,"Thanks for the ideas Ben, but we're currently building out our login page and don't have access to the session storage or cookie data yet. Simply put, we can't log in due to no established cookies."
782,2019-02-18T16:08:31.087500,Jewell,You didn't specify that this was for a login page
782,2019-02-18T16:09:30.087900,Tynisha,"sorry Ben, sould'a mentioned that"
782,2019-02-18T16:09:57.088400,Jewell,I don't have any expertise with getting the login working. That's going to come down to the details. The libraries being used etc

783,2019-02-18T16:43:39.093100,Karoline,"essentially normally if you load a form say from Django itself, it'll ensure that a token is injected along with the form, and it expects that when you hit the server that this token will be included to verify the request came from a real session as opposed to a malicious link trying to trick you into doing some action"
783,2019-02-18T16:50:31.093400,Jonas,Can’t you do this using the ORM?
783,2019-02-18T16:51:49.094600,Karoline,"Depending on how much effort you want to put in to keeping it, you could potentially either proxy your served JS stuff through Django or have some sort of endpoint for serving csrf tokens I'd imagine."
783,2019-02-18T17:13:34.096300,Jorge,I dont believe you can do this type of querying of JSON fields in the ORM
783,2019-02-18T17:14:58.096500,Jorge,"looks like you can access keys, and the indices of arrays (so like `json__my_list__0__number=123`) but i dont see where you can search through all the items in a list with the ORM"

So docker compose works very well. Having two dockerfiles adds complexity, Imo, in starting them both, making sure they both run since one depends on another. Besides you'll need to somehow connect them between each other. And compose solves those problems at once.
Maybe I'm missing something (still new around containerization), but I think if you have more than one docker image you have no other way than compose."

ipaurl='<https://ipa-server.example.com/ipa/session/login_password>'
http = urllib3.PoolManager()
http.request('POST', ipaurl, headers=header, fields=login)

login and header are both dicts and look like this:

```login = {""user"": ""admin"", ""password"": ""p@s$w0rd_""}
header = {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', 'referer': ipaurl, 'Accept': 'text/plain'}```

799,2019-02-19T09:16:38.148600,Ashley,"No problem. The python function you originally showed me effectively generates a command by adding stuff to a list. There's no fancy objects involved with that part of the function. It's just a standard list using standard list methods (in Python, methods are functions that are ""bound"" to an object). That part also makes up the bulk of the code in that function.

At the end of that function, the list that was generated is then passed to something in `subprocess`, which is how the command is actually run.

Look at how the list is generated, what it looks like just before being passed to that part of `subprocess`, and how it gets passed to that part of `subprocess`. That will tell you exactly how you can make a new function (function != command. ""Function"" means code, while command is something you can in a shell/terminal/command prompt) to do what you want.

I can't get more specific than that without doing the work for you. So if you're not sure how to go about this, you should take a step back and look into what lists are in Python and how to work with them."

```
import cookie from 'react-cookies';

axios.defaults.xsrfCookieName = 'csrftoken';
axios.defaults.xsrfHeaderName = 'X-CSRFToken';
```

And later in the same file under the 'render()' section including a line saying:

```
&lt;input type='hidden' value={cookie.load(""csrftoken"")} name='csrfmiddlewaretoken' /&gt;
```

Finally, on the Django side under the 'views.py' file in my login app I added:

```
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt

@csrf_exempt
```

806,2019-02-19T21:34:14.195800,Sasha,"Can you clarify? The quotes around debug output aren't actually present in the string, if that's what you mean."
806,2019-02-19T21:34:35.196000,Devin,for example
806,2019-02-19T21:34:38.196100,Devin,None
806,2019-02-19T21:34:56.196700,Devin,and since this is being injected into a SQL statement it’s mucking things up
806,2019-02-19T21:35:17.197200,Devin,i’ve noticed that everything is single quotes except for instances where the replace was performed
806,2019-02-19T21:35:47.198100,Devin,"and to get the SQL to work that would need to be
`'Mary''s Pizza'` instead of `""Mary''s Pizza""`"
806,2019-02-19T21:35:59.198500,Carmen,Please post a copy of the code doing the replacing.
806,2019-02-19T21:36:12.198700,Devin,"`r[76].value.replace(""'"", ""''"")`"
806,2019-02-19T21:37:04.199800,Devin,i’m having a hard time googling this one because it’s tons of results where people want to replace double quotes lol
806,2019-02-19T21:37:29.200400,Carmen,And how are you adding it to the SQL? Because what you're doing in the replace shouldn't have anything to do with surrounding quotes.
806,2019-02-19T21:38:34.201100,Devin,well i’m pulling the example (like in the screenshot) before it’s passed
806,2019-02-19T21:39:22.202000,Carmen,"In that case, we're going to need to see a full copy of the code. What you're describing should not be happening at all from a simple replace operation."
806,2019-02-19T21:40:48.202200,Devin,but it is…
806,2019-02-19T21:40:49.202400,Devin,lol
806,2019-02-19T21:41:56.203100,Devin,"in python i know you can interchange `'` and `""` for strings, but is there a way to perhaps force one?"
806,2019-02-19T21:42:21.203500,Devin,"because it seems that the `.replace` function is outputting `""`"
806,2019-02-19T21:45:31.204400,Carmen,Then show us the code. There is absolutely no way to reproduce what you're seeing without having the code to run.
806,2019-02-19T21:47:06.205100,Devin,sure - i was trying to save time. For context I’m loading an excel file and pushing it to a database.
806,2019-02-19T21:47:20.205500,Devin,two parts:
806,2019-02-19T21:47:31.205600,Devin,None
806,2019-02-19T21:48:52.206300,Devin,And this is the function from that `Database` class
806,2019-02-19T21:49:05.206500,Devin,None
806,2019-02-19T21:49:50.207500,Devin,"and I can’t post a screenshot because it’s sensitive info, but I can clearly see that the results of the `.replace` are in double quotes and everything else is in single quotes"
806,2019-02-19T21:52:09.208900,Sasha,"Are you looking at the print output, or what is ending up in the database?"
806,2019-02-19T21:53:12.209600,Devin,print output because i haven’t got it to push to the DB yet and the error is super vague
806,2019-02-19T21:53:35.210000,Devin,So i was entering the output of the query directly into MSSQL
806,2019-02-19T21:53:47.210300,Devin,and when i run it I get an error on those lines
806,2019-02-19T22:01:08.213100,Devin,yes - and those end up getting replaced
806,2019-02-19T22:01:18.213500,Hiroko,"Escape them, then"
806,2019-02-19T22:01:40.214000,Devin,"that’s not the problem, it’s that their entire surrounding string turns from single quotes to double quotes"
806,2019-02-19T22:01:45.214200,Devin,nothing in the string itself
806,2019-02-19T22:03:53.215200,Devin,i mean that might not be it but i’m assuming that’s what it is
806,2019-02-19T22:04:20.216000,Raguel,what is the error you are getting?
806,2019-02-19T22:04:31.216600,Hiroko,"Quotes, whether single or double, don't matter to the db "
806,2019-02-19T22:04:33.216700,Devin,scratch all of that - a better question for me would be how can I output what is actually being passed to SQL
806,2019-02-19T22:04:56.217200,Devin,"so say i’m doing this `self.cur.execute(sql, values)`"
806,2019-02-19T22:05:08.217400,Devin,how can i view the output of that?
806,2019-02-19T22:05:19.217800,Devin,"other than this? `print(sql, values)`"
806,2019-02-19T22:09:01.218600,Hiroko,What database 
806,2019-02-19T22:09:15.219200,Hiroko,And have you looked how to escape quotes in sql?
806,2019-02-19T22:10:33.220300,Devin,"it’s mssql - and yes it’s escaped correctly for sql, but the double quotes surrounding that string is where i’m running into an issue"
806,2019-02-19T22:10:49.220600,Hiroko,How do you know that?
806,2019-02-19T22:11:06.221200,Hiroko,You haven't said anything about the specifics of the error
806,2019-02-19T22:11:55.221600,Devin,because i’m running it in SQL and it’s breaking

That part’s all fine and dandy… my question is, what’s a good way for me to restore soup’s HTML string to the original contents (with the variable names in it, before I do the replacement) after I do so?

So here’s what I’m talking about: `soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')` and then in my flask’s main function:
```@app.route('/velocify')
def letter_processing():```

I want something like `souptemp = soup` so that every time the post comes in, I can reset the string to the original version (with the variables) so I can find and replace them all over again.

The problem I’m having is… flask’s main function isn’t an actual loop, so things like `souptemp = soup` only get called once, so the second time I do a POST, the variables aren’t there to get replaced."

To get this POST, I have a small flask server running, and I’m able to test post data to it just fine.

The letter that I’m putting the customer data into is an HTML file, that I then convert to a PDF so I can print it. I’m using HTML because it was a good option since the letter has some images embedded in it (company logos), so this way we can have it formatted exactly how we want. I already have all of this part figured out.

I store the HTML as a string (using Beautiful Soup), and then I use re to replace the fields which are written as `{DateSold}` `{FirstName}` `{CarrierName}` and `{AttendantName}` with the actual data from the POST. I already have all that figured out too.

**The problem I have is** after I replace the fields once, and save the PDF, and then do a second test POST with different data, it still uses the data from the first test because the fields above aren’t there anymore. I’ve tried storing the original HTML as a second variable, and then rewriting it back to the first one in the main flask function, but since that’s not an actual loop, it only fires once, and isn’t actually helping.

So how can I restore the HTML string after altering it each time a POST occurs so re can do my replacements every time?

824,2019-02-20T15:45:46.038400,Clemmie,in order to do imports from other files your script needs to know about those files. having an empty file __init__.py in the folder allows that to happen. <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages>

828,2019-02-20T18:35:30.058900,Kristine,"So I made a small flask server that listens for url encoded POSTs from an API that occur every time a new customer is added to a database. I seem to have been mistaken on it being URL encoded though, because when I finally tested it with the site that has the customer data, I apparently returned a 405 (Method not allowed).

So my question is… How can I allow all types of methods, and just log the data, so I can do a test one just to see what method its actually using, and then alter my code accordingly? (Or at least, how can I record incoming data even if it’s not the type of method I’m taking, just so I can figure out what I”m working with?"
828,2019-02-20T18:36:23.059200,Hiroko,"well, method not allowed means HTTP method"
828,2019-02-20T18:36:43.059600,Hiroko,"so, that seems to be an issue of how your flask server is hitting that API"
828,2019-02-20T18:37:06.060200,Hiroko,"eg, if its expecting a POST when only a GET is mapped to that endpoint, you’ll get a 405"
828,2019-02-20T18:38:31.061500,Kristine,"Well the problem is that I’m not sending anything to their server, it’s the other way around. Their API sends POSTs to my server, and I’m the one that gave them the 405"
828,2019-02-20T18:38:45.061900,Hiroko,"ah, ok"
828,2019-02-20T18:38:56.062200,Hiroko,"so, is there a POST handler mapped to the URL?"
828,2019-02-20T18:39:15.062800,Hiroko,and is the URL in the mapping correct?
828,2019-02-20T18:39:53.064100,Kristine,"Yeah, I just tried changing it from args.get to form.get, waiting for the manager to come back to he can trigger another test from the system."
828,2019-02-20T18:39:54.064200,Hiroko,"for example, if you map `/some-resource/&lt;uuid&gt;/` and try calling it without the trailing slash, unless its specifically set up to handle that, you can get a 404 or 405"
828,2019-02-20T18:41:40.065100,Kristine,"Here’s what it comes in as on flask’s console `X.X.X.X - - [20/Feb/2019 15:31:36] ""POST /velocify? HTTP/1.1"" 200 -`

And here’s what I have at the moment (after the change I just mentioned:
```@app.route('/velocify', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def form_example():
    
    if request.method == 'POST': 
        dateSold = request.form.get('date_sold')
        firstName = request.form.get('first_name')
        carrierName = request.form.get('carrier_name')
        attendantName = request.form.get('attendant_name')```"
828,2019-02-20T18:43:49.066000,Kristine,"Okay so the manager came back, and did a test one, and it went through this time with a 200, so I guess that was what I had to do, change from args to forms"
828,2019-02-20T18:44:12.066400,Hiroko,"that would make sense, if you’re pushing form data"
828,2019-02-20T18:45:24.067200,Kristine,"Yeah, I thought it was just URL encoded, given the interface on their site where I configured the POST to my server, but apparently it’s form data anyways."
828,2019-02-20T18:45:30.067400,Kristine,Hence the confusion.
828,2019-02-20T18:45:37.067700,Kristine,But thanks for the help.

831,2019-02-21T07:32:11.088500,Karen,like for 10 browsers it take over 16gb ram
831,2019-02-21T07:32:14.088700,Karen,which is insane
831,2019-02-21T07:38:30.089300,Jettie,you can rent a server on AWS with like 128GB of RAM
831,2019-02-21T07:38:32.089500,Jettie,for pretty cheap
831,2019-02-21T07:39:11.090000,Karen,we have like machines with 2T ram but thats not the question
831,2019-02-21T07:39:26.090400,Karen,The idea is to optimize the code
831,2019-02-21T07:39:29.090600,Karen,not buy more hardware
831,2019-02-21T07:42:59.091300,Jettie,"I don't think you could optimize anything there, it's a pretty small snippet of code"
831,2019-02-21T07:42:59.091400,Karoline,can you just run fewer browser sessions concurrently?
831,2019-02-21T07:44:23.091900,Karen,<@Karoline> i can im looking for a way to minimize the ram taken by browser somehow

831,2019-02-21T07:46:36.093000,Hiroko,"&gt;&gt;&gt;for months (rendering a large variety of sites without restarts for weeks at a time)
Run it with:

 ` --js-flags=""--max_old_space_size=500""`
to force the VM to keep it GC’d below 500
Chrome v55 was a 30% memory savings, before that I used 1GB containers.

It’s not perfect, but I am definitely pushing high volume (multiple tabs, concurrent activity) and I am not having any significant stability issues and I am pushing diverse sets of webpages."
831,2019-02-21T07:47:29.093600,Hiroko,check out how to start chrome with vm and memory settings
831,2019-02-21T07:48:34.094400,Karoline,for what it's worth I use chrome headless through selenium (which I believe in the end is bottoming out in the same thing?  I always forget) and have never had a large issue with memory usage
831,2019-02-21T07:49:58.095600,Hiroko,"depending on what <@Karen> is doing, I could very well see each chrome instance taking up a gig and a half of ram"
831,2019-02-21T07:50:58.096500,Karoline,no we did fetches in serial but the instance size of the VM was quite small
831,2019-02-21T07:51:15.096800,Karoline,I think it was 1.7GB for the whole instance
831,2019-02-21T07:51:57.097600,Karoline,I'd have to check my notes though.  We'd occasionally see a site run up against memory constraints but it was pretty rare.  I suppose it depends on what he's crawling though
831,2019-02-21T07:52:42.097900,Hiroko,how heavy were the JS in the sites you were using?
831,2019-02-21T07:53:03.098300,Karoline,it's hard to say we rarely really looked at the actual sites themselves
831,2019-02-21T07:54:22.099100,Karoline,"basically it was just crawling everything on a domain and feeding it into a binary classifier so we could find the pages we were interested in, and then feeding the results down a pipeline for data extraction off of the interesting pages"
831,2019-02-21T07:54:29.099400,Karoline,so the crawler itself was pretty dumb
831,2019-02-21T07:55:46.100000,Hiroko,"hmm, alright.  I’ve done some work with headless browsers before, but that was just generating screenshots of static pages"
831,2019-02-21T07:56:22.100600,Hiroko,"this was with phantomjs, about five months or so before headless chrome came out and pjs was abandoned"
831,2019-02-21T07:57:41.101200,Karen,well im downloading captchas and shit like that
831,2019-02-21T07:57:55.102000,Karoline,my suspicion though now that I think about it is that they weren't *too* heavy on JS.  we used headless chrome so that we'd load them as true to a user's browser as possible
831,2019-02-21T07:57:59.102200,Karen,loading captchas and whatnot ... so
831,2019-02-21T07:58:13.102500,Karoline,"but these were real estate sites, so in the end they're all hoping to get crawled by google so they couldn't have been *that* crazy"
831,2019-02-21T07:59:26.103200,Karoline,"<@Karen> hopefully the wall of text of my digression didn't push it up too far, but make sure you notice <@Hiroko>'s suggestion"

835,2019-02-21T08:23:22.115500,Jonas,"In regards to your question, in general you need to give more information than ""it does not work"""
835,2019-02-21T08:23:36.116000,Jonas,I would immediately not use any tutorial that has put you towards writing that

835,2019-02-21T08:27:37.119100,Jonas,"flask-restful is a 3rd party package, but if you're building a REST api it's pretty good. Also, avoid mongodb IMO"

How do I pass the variable api to set_client in these two functions?

`in mb_account_bal`

837,2019-02-21T09:02:42.133400,Ashley,Np!
837,2019-02-21T09:28:08.134900,Mica,<@Franklyn> you're passing a varialbe that doesn't exist to `get-client`
838,2019-02-21T09:19:23.134400,Hiroko,"also, <@Jolanda> there’s a <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> channel here for a more targeted topic"
838,2019-02-21T09:28:23.135400,Mica,the simpliest way i can think off is passing the `api` instance to the clery task
838,2019-02-21T09:32:00.136100,Jonas,"I doubt that would work, the values need to be serialised to JSON"
838,2019-02-21T09:32:16.136500,Jonas,I recommend passing the username and password to the celery task
838,2019-02-21T09:36:19.139100,Franklyn,The username and password are for updating a third party class and subclass that manage a whole bunch of stuff including request.session. That will add complications
838,2019-02-21T09:38:10.139600,Jonas,you have those complications already
838,2019-02-21T09:38:17.140000,Hiroko,"problem is, a celery task relies on data that can be serialized and transported"
838,2019-02-21T09:38:29.140500,Jonas,"the celery task runs in a different process, maybe a different machine at a different time."
838,2019-02-21T09:38:51.141100,Hiroko,"the worker and task are running separately from the code you’re instanciating an object, so you need to use serialization to pack in data that task needs to run in order to transport it"
838,2019-02-21T09:40:39.142300,Jonas,and you need to design your systems to work in this way if you want background tasks.
838,2019-02-21T09:41:00.142900,Jonas,it gets really tricky if the credentials are time-bound as well
838,2019-02-21T09:43:59.145500,Franklyn,Hmm. For storing login credentials that this APICient relies on within a django project. Is it possible to have them in a django model with rest framework so they can be serialised and de-serialised then passed to the task? Would that be a good approach? I'd like the flexibility to edit the values from the admin page on the fly.
838,2019-02-21T09:45:42.145900,Jonas,you seem to be storing sensitive account credentials
838,2019-02-21T09:45:59.146400,Jonas,"be very, very careful with how you handle these usernames and passwords, especially if they are customer details"
838,2019-02-21T09:46:15.146800,Jonas,"and, as part of that, store them for as shorter time as possible. Things in databases tend to stay around forever."
838,2019-02-21T09:48:33.147900,Franklyn,<@Jonas> there not customer details so there's no worry about this.
838,2019-02-21T09:55:30.149300,Mica,"ye, creating a serialiser makes sense, also maybe a dedicated worker and def a dedicated queue if you're working with credentials, this should make sure those tasks are always executed and not waiting in whatever you're using as the queue handler"
839,2019-02-21T12:54:15.152000,Granville,Does anyone know if it's possible to perform sequential filters using regex? I have the following so far and I'm trying to get to the account_id by performing a second filter on the re.split output:
839,2019-02-21T12:57:31.153100,Sparkle,"You could just do `re.search('accounts/(\w+)/scopes', text)`"
839,2019-02-21T12:59:22.153600,Sparkle,Also is the account id always consistent.  E.g sfdc account ids are always 15 or 18 char
839,2019-02-21T13:00:25.153800,Granville,"Hi Aurielle, I'm not sure that'd work because I have an entire list of HTML URIs it would have to go to and filter on the word containing the colon in the end"
839,2019-02-21T13:01:41.154000,Sparkle,So what is the actual expected outcome?
839,2019-02-21T13:02:10.154200,Sparkle,Is it the literal word with a colon or the values in a live page that goes in place of that word
839,2019-02-21T13:15:17.154600,Deon,str being the url
839,2019-02-21T13:28:14.160100,Claudine,which error?
839,2019-02-21T13:37:30.162200,Arturo,still nothing
839,2019-02-21T13:37:40.162400,Arturo,really odd
839,2019-02-21T13:38:12.163400,Clemmie,can you show some surrounding code?
839,2019-02-21T13:39:53.163800,Deon,not sure I understand the question.. why not len(a) ?
839,2019-02-21T13:40:18.164000,Deon,do you need the count of elements inside each list within the list?
839,2019-02-21T13:43:28.164200,Arturo,None
839,2019-02-21T13:44:57.164500,Henrietta,"thing is, each element has a numpy array and a number as second element, that corresponds to the element class"
839,2019-02-21T13:45:10.164700,Henrietta,I need to count how many of each class there is
839,2019-02-21T13:46:06.165000,Henrietta,"I need to do slices of data for a ML training, and have to keep the proportions from the original dataset, that is too huge"
839,2019-02-21T13:47:24.165800,Sasha,It's not really obvious what is going on here. Where is `ne_name` coming from?
839,2019-02-21T13:47:32.166000,Deon,"so each list looks like [np.array([1,2,3]), 1, 2, 3]?"
839,2019-02-21T13:47:36.166200,Arturo,that is `ne`
839,2019-02-21T13:47:49.166600,Arturo,changed it to put on here :see_no_evil:
839,2019-02-21T13:47:55.166700,Deon,"sorry [np.array([1,2,3]), 1] *"
839,2019-02-21T13:48:00.167000,Henrietta,yes
839,2019-02-21T13:48:10.167500,Arturo,all the `ne` are `ne_name` on my code
839,2019-02-21T13:48:31.168100,Clemmie,same for `info_map` vs `RF_info_map`?
839,2019-02-21T13:48:46.168500,Clemmie,it is hard to parse when we need to do on the fly text replacement to read it
839,2019-02-21T13:49:18.169200,Arturo,"Same thing, have made amendments"
839,2019-02-21T13:49:26.169300,Henrietta,"I think maybe a for loop is the only way, since Counter can't count lists inside lists by my errors"
839,2019-02-21T13:49:41.169900,Sasha,And could you show some output?
839,2019-02-21T13:50:34.171000,Deon,class_list = [n[-1] for n in a]
839,2019-02-21T13:50:54.171900,Clemmie,"If you take it to it’s smallest bit does the problem still show up? Something like this
```
  for ne in info_map.keys():
      if ""UM"" in info_map[ne]:
        info_map[ne][""SITE_INFO""] = umtscell_info_list
        site_info = info_map[ne][""SITE_INFO""]
        print repr(info_map[ne]['SITE_INFO'])
```"
839,2019-02-21T13:51:21.172000,Henrietta,"wait, that's it?"
839,2019-02-21T13:52:39.172800,Sasha,I'll also note that you seem to be mixing Py2 and Py3 `print` syntax. Any chance that's causing things to not print?
839,2019-02-21T13:52:47.173000,Arturo,ah
839,2019-02-21T13:52:51.173200,Arturo,that could be it
839,2019-02-21T13:53:17.173800,Arturo,but the `rnc` name still prints and the is py3 syntax
839,2019-02-21T13:53:47.173900,Deon,run it see if it's what you want
839,2019-02-21T13:54:04.174100,Henrietta,doing it now
839,2019-02-21T13:54:48.174600,Sasha,Any chance that the code is actually throwing an exception that is being caught and suppressed by surrounding code?
839,2019-02-21T13:55:42.175500,Arturo,"it gets to the end of the function. As there is a print statement there saying ""No node name for ne"""
839,2019-02-21T13:56:03.176000,Arturo,"sorry I would share more with you, but is my works code and don't want to get in trouble"
839,2019-02-21T13:56:15.176200,Sasha,Can you share the output?
839,2019-02-21T13:58:32.177300,Arturo,"```
print rnc_name
RNC201
print info_map[ne].keys()
['UM', 'GB']
```
They rest doesn't print anything"
839,2019-02-21T13:59:06.177600,Sasha,So it doesn't print `this is site info`?
839,2019-02-21T13:59:26.177900,Arturo,nope which is really bizarre
839,2019-02-21T14:01:41.179300,Sasha,"Something is broken in your model of what's going on, I think. Like, it's actually running a different version of the code than what you're editing, or something odd like that. I'd shut everything down and then reload your environment, etc."
839,2019-02-21T14:02:10.179500,Arturo,cool will do
839,2019-02-21T14:02:31.180000,Arturo,"my leave it till tomorrow now, want to go home and do some of my own projects!"
839,2019-02-21T14:03:04.180600,Arturo,thanks <@Sasha> :taco: <@Clemmie> :taco:
839,2019-02-21T14:05:35.181000,Henrietta,that gives me a list of categories
839,2019-02-21T14:05:39.181200,Henrietta,I can Counter that
839,2019-02-21T14:05:54.181400,Henrietta,thanks for the tip <@Deon> :taco:
839,2019-02-21T14:19:11.185400,Cheri,Also is there no way to store the modules necessary for an application within the application like its done with React/JS?
839,2019-02-21T14:19:54.186200,Clemmie,"You can put the virtual environment in the project, but you still need to activate it"
840,2019-02-21T13:15:09.154400,Deon,what about str.split('/')[-2] ?
840,2019-02-21T13:19:16.156500,Henrietta,"What would be the best way to count elements in a list that are like this:
`a = [[numpy array, 0], [numpy array, 1], [numpy array, 9]....,]`"
840,2019-02-21T13:19:51.157200,Henrietta,is a simple `for` loop the best or I can make use of `Counter` from `collections`?
840,2019-02-21T13:27:44.159900,Arturo,"I have a dictionary like so;

```
type(info_map[ne])
&gt;&gt;dict
```
I am trying to add a new key value pair like so;

```
info_map[ne]['new_key'] = new_val

```
But I am getting an error. Is this the correct way?"
840,2019-02-21T13:28:29.160400,Arturo,it just doesn't print anything
840,2019-02-21T13:28:51.160800,Arturo,"its really weird, my works code base and it simply doesn't print it"
840,2019-02-21T13:29:40.161200,Claudine,like you run that and then do `print(info_map[ne]['new_key'])` and no output hm?
840,2019-02-21T13:32:27.161400,Arturo,yup
840,2019-02-21T13:32:31.161600,Arturo,really odd
840,2019-02-21T13:33:22.162000,Sasha,Maybe try `repr()` in case it's printing an empty string or something.
840,2019-02-21T13:37:50.162700,Arturo,when I print the value there is something there
840,2019-02-21T13:38:26.163700,Arturo,"when I print the keys of;
```
info_map[ne]
```
It shows the keys"

841,2019-02-21T14:16:56.182500,Cheri,Him I’m really new to Python and I was just wondering why do we need virtual environments when running it n terminal?
841,2019-02-21T14:17:55.183300,Clemmie,"That is a long answer, but written up well at <https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/#why-the-need-for-virtual-environments>"

841,2019-02-21T14:20:09.187100,Ashley,that's actually a pretty solid writeup. Nice link <@Clemmie>! :taco:
841,2019-02-21T14:20:39.187700,Clemmie,"There are also other solutions - Docker containers, VMs etc. but as a base case, and pretty much all the time you want to be using virtual envs"
841,2019-02-21T14:21:09.188900,Clemmie,then it get’s into a big discussion of how to manage them - but we can help walk you through that once you have a good handle on _what_ and _why_ they are
841,2019-02-21T14:23:43.193100,Ashley,"<@Cheri> bundling everything together can mess with how python expects to find resources. Typically, people specify their package's dependencies in their `setup.py` file, which is a complex system you don't need to worry about at the moment. What it does is basically tell `pip` to install those dependencies before installing your package itself. So when you run `pip install some_package`, you'd see it install `dependency_a` and `dependency_b` first, and then install `some_package`, all automatically"
841,2019-02-21T14:24:58.194000,Ashley,"bundling them together also means a lot of extra code in the package, and the potential for a lot of duplications of packages existing for the same environment"
842,2019-02-21T14:51:17.195300,Genaro,"Is `setup.py` preferred over `requirements.txt`? I guess setup.py is used for packaging/distributing/deploying the app but for ""solo hack projects"" requirements.txt is good enough?"
842,2019-02-21T14:55:34.195800,Ashley,I believe `setup.py` is preferred

842,2019-02-21T15:06:36.198100,Carmen,"Basically, if you're expecting to `pip install` your project somewhere, and it has dependencies that also need to be installed, you want to put those dependencies in `setup.py`."
842,2019-02-21T15:07:27.199300,Carmen,"If you're just listing out your dependencies for a project that people will fork and use, but not install via pip, general community expectations are `requirements.txt` as the de-facto standard for listing your dependencies."

    m_row.insert(0,m_symbol)
    line = str(m_row)

output:

```
&lt;class 'str'&gt;

```

Guess I""m not sure why it's still contained within [ ] brackets like a list?"
847,2019-02-22T00:37:53.225300,Sasha,"It's because you're asking for the string form of a list object. If you just want the values as a comma-separated string, you'd use something like `','.join(str(x) for x in m_row)`."
847,2019-02-22T00:38:33.225800,Sasha,"Or even `','.join(m_row)` since it looks like your numbers are strings to start with."
847,2019-02-22T00:50:40.228100,Stacy,"great.  Thank you <@Sasha> !  I was close earlier but had something like `s ="","".join(str(m_row))` and it was joining each character of the list separated by a comma instead.

    m_symbol = 'MSFT'
    m_row.insert(0,m_symbol)
    s = "","".join(m_row)

847,2019-02-22T00:58:22.229800,Stacy,"i did get the symbol quoted easily enough because i'm adding that part in as part of the process.  i think the only other part is the date/time stamp which may a bit trickier

847,2019-02-22T01:01:57.231300,Sasha,"Can you clarify what rule you would like to use for quoting values? If you can specify what type of thing should be quoted or not, you can filter on that characteristic in code."
847,2019-02-22T01:04:09.231900,Stacy,"i think i just want the lines to look like this:  `""MSFT"",""2019-01-31 09:35:00"",103.9200,104.4800,103.5800,104.4300,4252406`"
847,2019-02-22T01:04:31.232400,Stacy,"so the symbol and date/timestamp being strings, the rest are integer/floats."
847,2019-02-22T01:05:52.233500,Stacy,so can probably do something with m_row[0] or m_row[1] (after adding the symbol) and quote that
847,2019-02-22T01:06:04.233700,Stacy,before converting to a string

854,2019-02-22T10:10:36.278000,Hiroko,"been a while since I’ve done anything python and windows, and got burned enough to not really want to try again"
854,2019-02-22T10:11:51.279700,Pilar,"Yeah, only doing so now out of necessity. I'm an Ubuntu guy but my work machine is Windows 10. I have tried the 14.0 version specifically as well as the latest download"
854,2019-02-22T10:13:36.281300,Pilar,Python should keep your dict ordering
854,2019-02-22T10:13:48.281900,Nena,i am with 2.7
854,2019-02-22T10:13:49.282000,Hiroko,for python 3.6 and up
854,2019-02-22T10:13:57.282400,Hiroko,then you need to use an OrderedDict
854,2019-02-22T10:14:15.283600,Nena,"that does not do much as well, i did try OrderedDict"
854,2019-02-22T10:14:32.284200,Ashley,"holy crap there's a lot of ""Abhishek"" on this slack"

854,2019-02-22T10:15:09.286300,Hiroko,no spamming at all.  some names seem to be pretty common
854,2019-02-22T10:15:14.286800,Nena,yup thats me :elon:
854,2019-02-22T10:15:16.287000,Ashley,"I mean I tried to tag you, and it suggested dozens of others with a similar name"
854,2019-02-22T10:15:32.287300,Hiroko,and slack tends to allow non-unique names which can make tagging… interesting
854,2019-02-22T10:15:43.287800,Hiroko,just like with `@matt`….
854,2019-02-22T10:15:52.288200,Hiroko,hmm
854,2019-02-22T10:15:54.288400,Nena,hehehe
854,2019-02-22T10:16:08.289000,Ashley,"also, you should try to get off of python 2 and move to 3 soon, as it reaches end of life in less than a year"
854,2019-02-22T10:16:13.289200,Hiroko,wouild be interesting to categorize user names by location
854,2019-02-22T10:16:30.289600,Hiroko,for this community.  what’s the more common usernames for a general area?
854,2019-02-22T10:16:31.289700,Nena,"yup, we will move by EOY"
854,2019-02-22T10:16:54.290100,Ashley,nice!
854,2019-02-22T10:17:00.290300,Nena,lets write a script to find that out
854,2019-02-22T10:17:23.290800,Nena,"admin, need token permission for slack"
854,2019-02-22T12:19:42.294300,Carlo,hypothesis -&gt; script -&gt; solution

857,2019-02-22T15:04:46.300600,Clemmie,Have you tried f-strings (if &gt;=3.6) or `.format()`?
857,2019-02-22T15:06:12.301700,Necole,does the \” after SSH escape the ”
857,2019-02-22T15:06:30.302000,Clemmie,With the r string you might need to use `format` regardless
857,2019-02-22T15:06:46.302300,Necole,r”\\SERVER\c$\SSH\\” + data + ‘.csv’
857,2019-02-22T15:09:13.303600,Nenita,"and the :taco: award goes to <@Necole>. thank everyone. I've never had to use .format(), but adding an extra backslash did the trick. Can't believe that was the one thing I didn't try."

858,2019-02-22T15:56:13.308800,Sasha,"Sure. You are assigning `new` to the return value of the `append()` call, but it isn't returning anything, so `new` is just `None`. You should do the append and then `return high_scores` instead to get the modified list."
858,2019-02-22T15:57:20.309300,Sasha,"(Other folks: is there a `global` issue here too, or is it okay as is?)"
858,2019-02-22T15:58:21.310700,Clemmie,"Not so much an issue - no need to return, could just call the function and then print the list - but this is a better structure for future learning _not_ to use globals"

The newly installed one from Brew is located at:

860,2019-02-22T19:12:20.314200,Hanh,/usr/local/bin is where node usually puts links to things. What does `node --version` say?
860,2019-02-22T19:14:21.315100,Hanh,"If it’s a previous version, then it may not have linked the new one for some reason. Run
```
brew unlink node
brew link node@11

I'm using it to get a list of (max) 40 posts from users to calculate a few metrics like engagement rate. However every few hundred it goes into a time-out.

`instagram_web_api.errors.ClientConnectionError: timeout The read operation timed out`

I have already added back-off retries and things like that but would there be other things you can suggest to catch the error and not crash my script? I need to calculate the metrics for +-100k accounts. So babysitting it and restarting multiple times a day isn't an option  :( "

864,2019-02-23T02:52:39.335600,Sasha,Maybe try `2` without the quotes? I'd expect that to want an integer rather than a string.
864,2019-02-23T03:01:10.336600,Conchita,"If I remove the quotes like `<http://df.at[2|df.at[2>, 'powercut'] = 'Elephant'` nothing apparently happens"

864,2019-02-23T03:05:49.337400,Sasha,Really? That is odd...
864,2019-02-23T03:06:37.338000,Sasha,"Maybe try `print(<http://df.at[2|df.at[2>, 'powercut'])` to double-check?"
864,2019-02-23T03:16:27.338500,Conchita,"Tried, and this is strange. Mind you that the field of [2, 'powercut'] is equal to `False`"
864,2019-02-23T03:16:37.339100,Conchita,I don't get why this is happening. Do you <@Sasha>?
864,2019-02-23T03:21:17.339800,Sasha,My best guess is that it has autodetected the powercut column as a boolean type and is continuing to enforce that.
864,2019-02-23T03:24:56.340400,Layla,"can you try `df.set_value('2', 'powercut', 'Elephant')`"
864,2019-02-23T03:26:45.341400,Layla,Also what does your data look like you are importing? You have something odd with your indexe changing from int to float.
864,2019-02-23T03:27:09.341900,Conchita,"Same result <@Layla>. `df.set_value('2', 'powercut', 'Elephant')` creates a new row where the 'powercut' column is `elephant` and the rest is NAN"
864,2019-02-23T03:27:48.343300,Conchita,I can change the field from `True / False` to `1 / 0`
864,2019-02-23T03:28:39.344100,Sasha,"How about `df.loc[2, 'powercut'] = 'Elephant'`?"
864,2019-02-23T03:29:50.344800,Conchita,"That did the trick! Thank you so much, have a :taco: <@Sasha>"
864,2019-02-23T03:30:08.345300,Sasha,"Cool. Apparently `at` tries to preserve the type, but `loc` doesn't."

864,2019-02-23T09:21:24.349800,Carlota,Using a python library named Troposphere.  This is not a question about Troposphere but just to give you some context.  I need to replace the `{}` with the `eks_cluster_name` value  using a multi-line string.  I thought I could do something with `format` but it does not work.
864,2019-02-23T10:23:31.354600,Elliott,"<@Carlota> format works fine with a multi line string, I think you need to escape the other `{}` ( `{BootstrapArguments}` , `{AWS::StackName}`, `{AWS::Region}`) by using `{{...}}`, if those represent variable names, then you should pass them to the parameters of format instead, hope that could help."
865,2019-02-23T03:28:45.344300,Nigel,"&gt; so.  apparently, this is a thing.  you need to pass `delete=False`, then `f.close()`, annnnd then you can reference the file
<@Shan> You've faced buffering I guess. Try to `f.flush()` before closing the file and then access its content.
```
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as t:
        t.write(content)
        t.flush()
        t.read()  # content should be available

868,2019-02-23T12:29:07.358100,Carmen,Or is it just not doing what you expect?
868,2019-02-23T12:29:26.358500,Carmen,"Also, is that /etc/crontab, or your user crontab?"
868,2019-02-23T12:30:04.359300,Kristine,"I’m sure. What the script does is it iterates through a folder of PDFs, printing each one out, and deleting it, and there was 1 PDF there lastnight, and it was still there now, this morning, and when I run the script manually it works correctly"
868,2019-02-23T12:30:43.360000,Kristine,"and it’s whatever “crontab -e” is, I admit I don’t actually know, I presume my user crontab. But like I said, I have a bunch of other entries there that are working."
868,2019-02-23T12:30:54.360200,Carmen,That is your user crontab.

868,2019-02-23T12:32:21.362400,Carmen,I'd take a look in there to see what errors it might be encountering.
868,2019-02-23T12:32:34.362700,Carmen,My first assumption is that there's a path issue coming up for some reason.
868,2019-02-23T12:33:13.363500,Carmen,"You should also add some stderr redirection into a logfile to your entry, so you can more easily see when it encounters an error of some kind."
868,2019-02-23T12:34:43.364300,Carmen,"And if you're doing that, stdout redirection is a good idea as well.
`0 0 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/fileserver/printletters.py &gt; printletters-output.log 2&gt;printletters-errors.log`"

868,2019-02-23T15:50:28.374700,Dawn,"Anyone here working with pyMongo? Trying to iterate over a large MongoDB collection in batches with the find_raw_batches() method, but it looks like it still pulls the full collection in memory and creates an iterator with the batch sizes. This makes my memory usage explode. Would be great to figure out a way to actually only pull in one batch at a time, handle the batch, lose the batch out of memory and then go back to the server for a new batch :thinking_face:

You can find the documentation here: <http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/api/pymongo/collection.html#pymongo.collection.Collection.find_raw_batches>. If we take this code, the count_documents already output all documents (more than the set batch_size), which tells me everything is already in memory before the loop.

Any ideas?
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import bson
&gt;&gt;&gt; cursor = db.test.find_raw_batches()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(cursor.count_documents)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for batch in cursor:
...     print(bson.decode_all(batch))
```"
868,2019-02-23T16:01:44.375700,Ashley,"maybe it functions like a generator, and by printing `cursor.count_documents`, you're forcing it to resolve and load everything into memory?"

868,2019-02-23T16:07:26.378200,Ashley,maybe put a break point in so you can slow it down and give yourself time to check

878,2019-02-24T04:51:23.402400,Jettie,"maybe it's an inefficient algorithm, or maybe it's huge amount of numeric computations"
878,2019-02-24T08:45:11.404000,Louella,"With python you will get slower programs that with languages that are ""closer to the metal"".

Usually the way to optimize for speed is finding the slowest part (as <@Jettie> has mentioned) and if after making sure your algorithm is optimal you still need faster software, then you should consider writing that part as an independent library on C, and use python bindings to integrate it with your python code."
878,2019-02-24T10:06:46.411700,Ashley,"<@Sade> as the others mentioned, find the slowest part, and try to speed it up.

884,2019-02-24T13:46:38.438500,Reggie,"hi guys, somehow i have the feeling that i am totally overthinking a solution for a problem. i'm doing some exercises and there is one about 2 arrays. the first array is representing the size of a fish and the second array represents their direction (it can be just 0 or 1). if the fishes are swimming the same direction, they will never meet and therefore never eat each other. the bigger fish is always eating the smaller fish and so on and  so on.

for example, given those arrays:
```  A[0] = 4    B[0] = 0
  A[1] = 3    B[1] = 1
  A[2] = 2    B[2] = 0
  A[3] = 1    B[3] = 0
  A[4] = 5    B[4] = 0```

you have to find out how many fish will survive. there is just one fish swimming in the opposite direction, which is fish A[1]. this fish will eat fish A[2] and A[3] but will be eaten by fish A[4].
therefore only 2 fish (A[0] and A[4]) will survive as they are swimming in the same direction and will never collide.
i was thinking of a for loop in the very beginning..but if i do that and for example fish A[1] would eat the A[4]..i would never hit the fish A[0] again. i started thinking of a while loop and so on... does someone has an idea? i hope its more or less clear - otherwise please feel free to ask :man-shrugging::pray: thanks!"

890,2019-02-24T21:59:42.482500,Hai,"<@Sasha> am getting an error saying can only concatenate list (not ""range"") to list"
890,2019-02-24T22:02:02.482700,Sasha,"Sorry about that. In Py2, `range` is a list, but in Py3 it's an interator, so you can do `[0].extend(range(...))` instead, or `[0] + list(range(...))`."
890,2019-02-24T22:05:47.482900,Hai,it says data must be pandas dataframe not &lt;class list&gt;
890,2019-02-24T22:06:57.483100,Hai,"after that i did plot = sns.pairplot(columns, hue='target'), size=2.5) # 'target' is the column name which is the '0' which we are adding in the code"
890,2019-02-24T22:08:03.483300,Sasha,"Yeah, that's not going to work. The `columns` is just a parameter to pass to `iloc()` to select which columns you want, it's not the data itself to be plotted."
890,2019-02-24T22:09:45.483600,Hai,then after that how would i make the pieces of data to dataframe ?
890,2019-02-24T22:10:51.483800,Hai,"so ""columns"" has pieces of columns out of 200 right?? so how would i make that pieces of data to pandas dataframe so that i can do sns.pairplot if i have the data in dataframe"
890,2019-02-24T22:13:48.484000,Sasha,"In your original code, you were selecting columns to plot by using `0:10`, right? The `columns` variable is a replacement for that specification... it's an explicit list saying you want columns 0, 11, 12, etc. instead of ""0 through 10"", that's all."
890,2019-02-24T22:18:49.484400,Hai,"so it will be like ?
data_slicing = data.iloc[:, columns]  ?"
890,2019-02-24T22:20:01.484600,Sasha,Yep
890,2019-02-24T22:21:35.484800,Hai,"afte that i did this sns.pairplot(data_slicing, hue=''target"", size=2.5) i got the error # could not broadcast input array from shape(20000, 2) into shape (20000)"
890,2019-02-24T22:22:43.485000,Sasha,"You'll have to ask someone else about that... I don't know anything about `sns`, I'm afraid."
890,2019-02-24T22:25:33.485200,Hai,"seaborn pair plot this generally accepts dataframe in the dataframe we should give some target column whch we want to determine in the graph. in my case i have 200columns and am splitting into pieces with adding the first 0th column as target to all the pieces so i basically need a for loop of pieces with the target. so can i assume the ""columns"" varibale is one a piece? then can i convert it into dataframe and do sns.pairplot?"
890,2019-02-24T22:30:02.485500,Sasha,Does the pairplot work if you use your original `0:10` column specification?
890,2019-02-24T22:31:31.485700,Hai,"yes it works for the first 10columns 0:10 because it has the target in the 0th colum itself so it works, when it comes to 11:20 it doesnt have any target because target is at 0th column so it fails so basically i need to target to each piece i tried pandas merge,join,concat nothing worked"
890,2019-02-24T22:33:22.485900,Sasha,Maybe print `data_slicing` to see if you can spot any weirdness in it?
890,2019-02-24T22:40:41.486600,Hai,i think it worked. so i did like this after data_slicing pd.DataFrame(data_slicing) then it made it into dataframe and then worked. Thank you so much <@Sasha> appreciate it
890,2019-02-24T22:41:26.486800,Sasha,Cool

Internally I'm managing pandas dataframes...but I'm not sure how to present that to the end user.  I'm looking to put filters at the top of whatever interface and the dataframe info below (which then updates as the filters are changed).  The last step, once filtered as the user wants is to hit ""go"" (or whatever button).  I'm not sure if this can/should be done in Tkinter? django? Other?  (even just suggesting probably shows how little I know :slightly_smiling_face: )  What should I start looking into/learning?"

893,2019-02-25T00:55:48.493800,Sasha,"You're initializing it from a regular dict, which doesn't preserve order. You should pass in like a list of tuples or something."
893,2019-02-25T01:00:13.494800,Sasha,(Though actually regular dicts should preserve order too in recent Py3 versions.)

Hey guy does this meet pep8 guide or is there a more pythonic way to do it? I feel like its not very pythonic"
894,2019-02-25T01:34:35.497900,Sasha,"I'd consider a `try` block there, catching `AttributeError` and `KeyError`, mainly because the repetition annoys me. But it's a question of style."
894,2019-02-25T01:37:14.500300,Sasha,"Personally, I would try to at least guarantee that `param` exists earlier in the code, creating an empty dict if it doesn't, since object attributes normally are an API invariant. Then you could use `get('is_default_agent_name', False)` in cases like this as a one-liner, for the leftover uncertainty."
894,2019-02-25T01:38:05.500600,Adolfo,i like that idea. Thats much safer and readable

898,2019-02-25T10:16:56.531300,Clemmie,"<@Weldon> You will get the most help if you can show/tell what you are trying to do, what you have tried, and the errors you are getting"
898,2019-02-25T10:17:30.531900,Clemmie,Use the snippet feature (the + next to the comment box) to show code and error stack traces
898,2019-02-25T10:18:40.532200,Weldon,Yes. Give me a minute
898,2019-02-25T10:20:39.532800,Weldon,I am trying to build a pokerbot for one poker website.
898,2019-02-25T10:21:06.533500,Weldon,I am using pyautogui module to automate some basic stuff.
898,2019-02-25T10:24:56.534600,Weldon,Screenshot functions are not able to locate a particular png.
898,2019-02-25T10:26:10.535900,Clemmie,"Please show _actual_ code as well as any errors you are getting. Preferably limit the code to the section that is causing difficulties, as well as any contextual code we would need to understand it. As you are asking right now any one who want to help you needs to imagine what code you may have written"
898,2019-02-25T10:28:12.536500,Hiroko,<@Weldon> you know your problem that you’re having and the code that causes it.
898,2019-02-25T10:28:14.536800,Hiroko,we don’t
898,2019-02-25T10:28:30.537200,Hiroko,so please incorporate that perspective when structuring your questions
898,2019-02-25T10:31:54.537300,Weldon,I am not getting the desired results while using pyautogui module
898,2019-02-25T10:32:19.538000,Jonas,That is... woah :joy:
898,2019-02-25T10:32:34.538600,Jonas,that's a first. Please copy and paste your code <@Weldon> into a code snippet
898,2019-02-25T10:32:47.538900,Clemmie,Please use the + next to the comment box to show code with the snippet feature. It is hard for us to jump back and forth between a screenshot and commenting
898,2019-02-25T10:33:14.539500,Weldon,There is no + sign next to comment box :sweat_smile:
898,2019-02-25T10:33:32.540000,Clemmie,Just to the left of where you type is a +
898,2019-02-25T10:33:45.540200,Clemmie,in slack
898,2019-02-25T10:33:55.540300,Hiroko,None
898,2019-02-25T10:34:12.540700,Weldon,No + sign 
898,2019-02-25T10:34:31.541500,Jonas,That's because you're on a mobile device
898,2019-02-25T10:34:39.541800,Jonas,"How would you expect to copy the code to your mobile, for pasting via that?"
898,2019-02-25T10:35:20.542400,Weldon,Give me some time.
898,2019-02-25T10:35:37.543000,Leana,"Please use the snippet feature, or backticks, when sharing code. You can do so by clicking on the :heavy_plus_sign: on the left of the input box for a snippet.

898,2019-02-25T10:35:47.543400,Hiroko,user experience really differs between mobile and other devices
898,2019-02-25T10:35:55.543800,Hiroko,are you able to use the website?
898,2019-02-25T10:36:02.544100,Clemmie,We are in no rush -there is always someone here. Ask again when you are ready in a good environment to really dig into the problem
898,2019-02-25T10:36:05.544300,Hiroko,slack works equally well in the browser
898,2019-02-25T10:39:03.544500,Weldon,I am getting the same result for both the queriers
898,2019-02-25T10:39:48.545300,Clemmie,you mean with the 2 calls to `getpixel`? are you sure that the pixel values are different at those two locations?
898,2019-02-25T10:40:38.546200,Clemmie,"Those are fairly close together on a modern monitor, with an ok chance they are pixels in the same widget, with a higher probability they are the same color"
898,2019-02-25T10:40:55.546500,Jonas,`im` is an `Image` object. Try `im.show()`
898,2019-02-25T10:41:07.546800,Jonas,And see what the image contains
898,2019-02-25T10:42:00.546900,Weldon,Yes. Same result for both the queries.
898,2019-02-25T10:42:39.547500,Clemmie,But that might be ok - if both of those pixels are black that is the result you would expect
898,2019-02-25T10:43:22.548000,Weldon,I have tried all other values also but getting the same outpuy.
898,2019-02-25T10:43:29.548200,Weldon,*output
898,2019-02-25T10:43:38.548400,Weldon,"(0, 0, 0)"
898,2019-02-25T10:44:24.549300,Weldon,Let me demonstrate through a video. Give me a minute.
898,2019-02-25T10:49:37.550200,Jonas,<@Weldon> A video is really not going to help
898,2019-02-25T10:49:48.550500,Jonas,"You have an issue, your image appears to be blank"
898,2019-02-25T10:50:03.550900,Jonas,"You can debug this. First validate that the image is indeed blank, `im.show()`"
898,2019-02-25T10:50:28.551500,Jonas,"If so, check if it's the `region` you're taking a screenshot of"
898,2019-02-25T10:50:39.551900,Jonas,Try just calling `pyautogui.screenshot()` and see if that works
898,2019-02-25T10:51:03.552200,Joette,you can replace the index
898,2019-02-25T10:51:24.552400,Joette,`df.index = some_new_index`
898,2019-02-25T10:51:59.552600,Joette,maybe `df.index = pd.Index(list(range(len(df.index))))`
898,2019-02-25T10:52:26.553200,Weldon,<@Jonas> Yes the image is blank.
898,2019-02-25T10:52:34.553500,Joette,"though that wouldn't maintain the steps you have, but that's solvable!"
898,2019-02-25T10:52:41.553900,Weldon,pyautogui.screenshot() is not capturing the sceen
898,2019-02-25T10:53:24.554900,Weldon,I have tried using different regions but not getting the desired results
898,2019-02-25T10:54:49.555100,Clemmie,Do you have multiple monitors?
898,2019-02-25T10:55:52.555300,Clemmie,Also what OS are you using?
898,2019-02-25T10:56:52.556100,Clemmie,You can start to see if it is in the right place using `pyautogui.size()` it should return the size in pixels of your monitor
898,2019-02-25T11:05:55.557700,Weldon,No I have only one monitor and i am using Ubuntu 18.0.4LTS
898,2019-02-25T11:06:52.558300,Clemmie,Is it giving you the right size of your monitor with with `pyautogui.size()`?
898,2019-02-25T11:07:09.558500,Weldon,Yes.
898,2019-02-25T11:07:42.559200,Weldon,Yes.
898,2019-02-25T11:08:18.559600,Weldon,What should i do?
898,2019-02-25T11:08:22.559800,Clemmie,and `im.show()` is just showing you a black picture
898,2019-02-25T11:08:51.560000,Clemmie,sorry `img1.show()`
898,2019-02-25T11:11:45.560600,Clemmie,<@Weldon> it looks like this may be a known and outstanding issue with pyautogui <https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui/issues/280>
898,2019-02-25T11:13:57.561000,Jonas,"&gt; I think the problem is that pyautogui doesn't come to terms with wayland yet, the x11 substitute."
898,2019-02-25T11:14:26.561300,Jonas,"If you're trying to make a poker bot, there are way better ways than reading the screen"
898,2019-02-25T11:14:37.561600,Jonas,that's..... going to be hard.
898,2019-02-25T11:15:03.562100,Clemmie,best bet is probably intercepting/injecting  json
898,2019-02-25T11:15:29.562700,Jonas,:point_up_2: if you're struggling to capture the screen just wait until you need to do object detection
898,2019-02-25T11:16:34.563700,Clemmie,<@Jonas> possibly not though. With a known set of assets pyautogui can actually search for matches and get the screen location
898,2019-02-25T11:16:41.564000,Clemmie,"Still not great, but tractable"
898,2019-02-25T11:23:57.566500,Keena,"i am getting issue as ""sublist parameters are not supported in python 3"" at part of lambda(v, k). do any one know how to solve this?"
898,2019-02-25T11:24:27.567300,Weldon,Thanks guys. I will try again with json and xpath.
898,2019-02-25T11:28:00.569800,Clemmie,"<@Keena> In python 3 a lambda doesn’t take multiple params. You need to access the params as a list, so `return sorted(dict_of_word_count.iteritems(), key=lambda v_k: (v_k[1],v_k[0]), reverse=True)[0:20]` should work I think (found at <http://cheng.logdown.com/posts/2016/11/30/python3-lambda-parameter>)"
898,2019-02-25T11:29:20.570500,Keena,"<@Clemmie> thanks for quick reply. will look into it. is this good? --&gt; return sorted(dict_of_word_count.iteritems(), key=lambda k_v: v_k[1], reverse=True)[0:20]"
898,2019-02-25T11:37:56.571400,Clemmie,"if you want to sort on the values that should work I think, yes"
898,2019-02-25T11:38:35.571800,Clemmie,but you switch the name `v_k` and `k_v` - jsut keep that variable name consistent
898,2019-02-25T11:38:47.572100,Clemmie,`k_v` is more correct
898,2019-02-25T11:39:27.573000,Keena,"actually I got that code snippet on web as lambda(v, k): (k, v), reverse=True"
898,2019-02-25T11:39:41.573400,Keena,so I thought about doing that thing
898,2019-02-25T11:39:47.573700,Keena,what do you say?
898,2019-02-25T11:41:01.575100,Clemmie,"Right, but now you are naming one variable, not multiples. Before you named them so you could sort on them in reverse (v,k -&gt; k,v), now it is just one and you are using the list index to pick them out"
898,2019-02-25T11:41:51.576000,Clemmie,"`iteritems()` gives a them as `(key, value)` so `k_v` is most internally consistent"
898,2019-02-25T11:42:51.576300,Carmen,<@Marth> Are your friends technical? Are you expecting them to run the script? Visit a webpage? The exactly workflow you want your friends to follow to get the data will help dictate what tools make the most sense.
898,2019-02-25T11:44:39.576400,Keena,got your point. trying out the thing which you explained.thank you buddy.
898,2019-02-25T11:44:54.576600,Clemmie,:thumbsup:
898,2019-02-25T11:56:46.583900,Marth,"<@Carmen> They're gamers....so while certainly computer savvy, not ""technical""  in the sense that I'm not expecting them to edit the script.  I'm expecting them to run the script which will provide an interface. That interface is going to list their twitch clips and allow them to sort/filter and then download those clips.  Currently, (as I'm told) filtering and sorting their clips is really bad....and then Twitch DOES allow them to download their clips, but it takes 3+ clicks per clip.  So I'm trying to help automate that process.  I'm not sure if a local .exe with gui or a webpage makes more sense."
898,2019-02-25T11:59:41.584400,Jimmy,Well it depends if you are familiar with any of the two
898,2019-02-25T12:01:25.585700,Carmen,"I think you could honestly use either for that. If you've got webdev experience, doing it as a webapp might be easier than learning GUI programming, but if you'd have to learn either, I'd probably argue this particular app makes more sense as a local exe with GUI."
898,2019-02-25T12:16:26.586400,Marth,awesome.  Thanks!  That's helpful! <@Carmen> :taco:
898,2019-02-25T12:19:40.588000,Carmen,"<https://www.pyinstaller.org/> is also an option, if you want to keep it mostly-Python"
898,2019-02-25T12:23:57.590900,Sasha,"Note that `for i in word` iterates over the characters in the string, not their index position."
898,2019-02-25T12:25:42.592600,Hiroko,"`enumerate` is a generator that for each iteration, returns a tuple of index, value"
898,2019-02-25T12:26:03.593300,Hiroko,`i` is the index of the location currently being looked at
898,2019-02-25T12:26:18.593900,Hiroko,`c` is the variable name for the value at that index location
898,2019-02-25T12:37:37.600600,Carmen,"<@Marth> Electron is based on Node.js and Chromium. So there won't be Python involved at all, really."
898,2019-02-25T12:38:19.600800,Marth,gotcha
899,2019-02-25T10:43:45.548600,Jimmy,and what's on screen ?
899,2019-02-25T11:07:25.559000,Clemmie,And you have a window open on that screen?
900,2019-02-25T10:49:11.549600,Ming,"In a Pandas dataframe, how do I change the index labels? It starts at 300000 but I want it to start at zero. Thanks!"
900,2019-02-25T10:53:05.554300,Ming,That's fine. And it worked! Thanks a lot! :smiley:
901,2019-02-25T12:17:38.586600,Mica,you could use something like Electron

I keep running into the error and am stumped. If anyone could lend some advice, I would appreciate it.

TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting"
901,2019-02-25T12:20:22.588900,Marth,"Thanks <@Mica> I'll look into that as well...I'm sure I can google it, but do you happen to know what python libraries/modules I should google for that?  Or is that outside of python itself?"
901,2019-02-25T12:22:51.590100,Jonas,"also the error you have given us is not the one you are experiencing, you are not doing string formatting"
901,2019-02-25T12:25:12.591900,Leopoldo,<@Jonas> thank you. I’ll play with that and try to understand. What does the c in enumerate(word) do?
901,2019-02-25T12:26:15.593800,Leopoldo,<@Sasha> ok so I wouldn’t need to create an array if it’s going to iterate over each character in a string?
901,2019-02-25T12:26:32.594400,Clemmie,<@Leopoldo> a string is already a list of characters
901,2019-02-25T12:26:42.594600,Leopoldo,<@Hiroko> Thank you for explaining that
901,2019-02-25T12:27:35.595800,Sasha,"Well, I was more explaining why `i % 2` was giving you that error. In your code, `i` is a character, not a number."
901,2019-02-25T12:28:09.596400,Leopoldo,<@Clemmie> ok thanks
901,2019-02-25T12:28:31.596800,Leopoldo,"Ok that makes sense, thank you <@Sasha>"
901,2019-02-25T12:28:56.597200,Leopoldo,"If I wanted to use i % 2, then I could combine that with say len(word)"
901,2019-02-25T12:29:13.597400,Leopoldo,And define i = 0
901,2019-02-25T12:31:27.599200,Sasha,"Yes, you could do `for i in range(len(word))`. No need for the `i = 0`, since the `for` loop initializes it anyway. But I'd suggest you think about `enumerate` more... it's a nice elegant solution to have access to both the character and its position in your loop."
901,2019-02-25T12:32:28.599900,Leopoldo,Thank you for that for that @ <@Sasha>. I will do some more research.
901,2019-02-25T12:47:37.602200,Leopoldo,I don’t understand how to implement your suggestion. I’ve tried a couple of different ways but am failing so far. <@Jonas>
901,2019-02-25T12:50:38.604500,Clemmie,<@Leopoldo> you are mixing a few different concepts that each could do it themselves and getting twisted up. The easiest way is:
901,2019-02-25T12:51:28.605700,Leopoldo,Thank you <@Candra> That was helpful for me
901,2019-02-25T12:51:59.607400,Leopoldo,<@Clemmie> Thank you. I didn’t realize it could be done so simply.
901,2019-02-25T12:56:03.613100,Leopoldo,"Thank you both <@Clemmie> <@Hiroko> You two rock, you’ve helped me a few times before and I really appreciate your patience and explanations."

903,2019-02-25T12:51:39.606400,Candra,<@Clemmie> has the same thing
903,2019-02-25T12:51:40.606600,Candra,:slightly_smiling_face:
903,2019-02-25T12:52:40.608400,Leopoldo,I can see my attempt was getting confusing. Now that it’s working I’ll take time to understand it a little.
903,2019-02-25T12:53:00.609000,Leopoldo,What does the ‘’.join() stand for?
903,2019-02-25T12:53:19.609500,Clemmie,"That way <@Candra> and I showed uses a list comprehension in the `join` call. List comprehensions are basically for loops for free, when you want the result to be a list"
903,2019-02-25T12:54:08.610600,Clemmie,"`str.join()` takes a list of strings and joins them into one string, with the str you called join on in between"
903,2019-02-25T12:54:31.611500,Clemmie,"so `','.join(['1','2','3'])` would result in `""1,2,3""`"
903,2019-02-25T12:54:37.611700,Hiroko,and you did this by initiating an empty string with `''`
903,2019-02-25T12:54:52.612100,Hiroko,"which made the `join` method available, because that’s part of the string type"

904,2019-02-25T14:06:24.615400,Clemmie,what have you tried?
904,2019-02-25T14:08:25.615800,Demetrice,Actually i think i just figured it out. This seems to be working
904,2019-02-25T14:08:36.616200,Demetrice,I think i just needed to define Name before the if statement
904,2019-02-25T14:08:37.616400,Demetrice,"Name = input(""What is your name?"")
if Name == '':
    Name = 'you'
def two_fer(name='you'):
    return(""One for %s, one for me."" %Name)
print(two_fer())"
904,2019-02-25T14:09:42.617200,Clemmie,"Well, the first issue is that you are referencing two different variables `Name` != `name`"
904,2019-02-25T14:10:19.617600,Clemmie,"also, generally you don’t want to use uppercase for variable names."
904,2019-02-25T14:11:32.619200,Clemmie,"given what you have, with me not changing variable names, you want to pass `Name` in the call to `two_fer()` and in the return you want to use the variable `name` which is scoped to the function"
904,2019-02-25T14:12:18.619700,Demetrice,So i made some minor changes and now this does seem to do what it's supposed to
904,2019-02-25T14:12:24.620000,Demetrice,But how can i make it better?
904,2019-02-25T14:12:33.620200,Clemmie,lets see
904,2019-02-25T14:12:37.620400,Demetrice,"name = input(""What is your name?"")
if name == '':
    name = 'you'
def two_fer(name='you'):
    return(""One for %s, one for me."" %name)
print(two_fer())"
904,2019-02-25T14:13:26.621000,Clemmie,so your scoping is still wrong - if you input “Hello” it will still print out “you”
904,2019-02-25T14:14:14.621600,Demetrice,By scoping what line are you referring to? I thought it would only print out you if the user inputs a blank
904,2019-02-25T14:14:21.621700,Clemmie,This passes the `name` that the user input to the method `two_fer`
904,2019-02-25T14:15:22.622900,Clemmie,"No, because you were calling the method without a parameter, which will then used the default parameter in the method signature(`def two_fer(name='you'):`)"
904,2019-02-25T14:15:48.623200,Demetrice,I see what you're saying
904,2019-02-25T14:16:12.624100,Demetrice,Because i left it blank on the print statement in the bottom it would always default to the you that i put in the def statement
904,2019-02-25T14:16:26.624800,Demetrice,I getya i getya. Thank you
904,2019-02-25T14:16:31.625300,Demetrice,What else did i do wrong?
904,2019-02-25T14:16:34.625400,Clemmie,"You handled the blank case in your `if` logic, and the default is handling the `None` case if no parameter (or `None`) is passed to the method"
904,2019-02-25T14:16:59.626100,Clemmie,otherwise it is fine
904,2019-02-25T14:17:28.627700,Ashley,"you can also do `if not name`, because `""""` is falsey"
904,2019-02-25T14:17:28.627800,Demetrice,Gezz. Such a simple assignment. Hard to believe i was doing so much wrong. Thank you so much for the help
904,2019-02-25T14:17:36.628100,Clemmie,If you only wanted to mutate the `name` if name is blank for the `two_fer` method you could do the check for `''` inside the method
904,2019-02-25T14:18:49.630200,Clemmie,"<@Ashley> is correct, but be aware that a lot of things are falsey, including `0` and `False`, also the time midnight and empty iterators. Take that into account if you are using falsey checking"
904,2019-02-25T14:19:49.631200,Demetrice,Okay. In the interest of learning i don't actually know how to use if not to check to see if a user input a value
904,2019-02-25T14:19:55.631500,Demetrice,I'm looking up the syntax for that now
904,2019-02-25T14:21:04.632700,Cherish,"&gt;also the time midnight
how do you get midnight to evaluate falsey? do datetime objects representing midnight evaluate to false?"
904,2019-02-25T14:22:51.632900,Clemmie,None
904,2019-02-25T14:23:46.633600,Clemmie,Datetime objects are ok because of the date portion
904,2019-02-25T14:24:32.634700,Clemmie,"^ is true as of at least 3.4, there was some talk about changing it later, but I can’t find a reference if it has"
904,2019-02-25T14:24:40.634900,Cherish,"ah ok, I always end up using datetime's so I never actually realized this^"
904,2019-02-25T14:25:05.635400,Ashley,<https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/truth.html> here's a general list
904,2019-02-25T14:25:28.635900,Clemmie,"Yeah, it is one of those fun edge cases. Shows up with some regularity in new years type checks"
904,2019-02-25T14:45:30.637700,Cherish,"looks like that might have been changed actually <@Clemmie> -- I'm on 3.7.2 and not getting that behavior, although I haven't seen this mentioned in a changelog equivalent anywhere
```Python 3.7.2 (default, Feb 12 2019, 08:15:36)

904,2019-02-25T14:46:37.638100,Cherish,&gt;remove the ability of datetime.time to be considered false (closes #13936) [#13936]
904,2019-02-25T14:49:09.638900,Clemmie,Nice - I am so glad they fixed that. I’m going to have to retire that gotcha
904,2019-02-25T14:52:08.639900,Demetrice,So for my next task. I'm writing a panagram tester. And while it works when i run the module it's failing a lot of the test conditions and i can't identify why
904,2019-02-25T14:52:14.640200,Demetrice,Here It is
904,2019-02-25T14:52:18.640400,Demetrice,"def is_pangram(sentence):
    alphabet = ''
    alph = ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ""
    sentence = input(""What is the string we would like to test?"")
    for i in sentence:
        if i in alph:
            alphabet += i
        else:
            pass
    alphabet = alphabet.lower()
    if ""abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"" in alphabet:
        return True
    else:
        return False
print(is_pangram(sentence = ''))"
904,2019-02-25T14:53:26.641700,Demetrice,"So i'm not sure if it's similar to earlier. I tried just calling sentence as is, in my print statement. and then i tried to just use a default argument instead in the def statement but that also didn't work"
904,2019-02-25T14:54:45.642300,Demetrice,Update -- I defined sentence outside of the function and that helped out. But i'm still failing 4/10 cases

904,2019-02-25T14:56:12.643400,Demetrice,Very cool. Thank You
904,2019-02-25T14:56:48.644300,Sasha,"You seem to be expecting that the `alphabet` string will remove duplicates and sort itself automatically, or else you're misunderstanding how `in` works."
904,2019-02-25T14:57:41.645100,Demetrice,Good point. I know how to fix the duplicates
904,2019-02-25T14:57:59.645700,Demetrice,"I thought by using ""in"" the order wouldn't matter"
904,2019-02-25T14:58:12.646100,Demetrice,"Do i need to make a list of each alphabet character? That would work, right?"
904,2019-02-25T14:58:46.646500,Sasha,"For strings, `in` does a substring match, like finding a word in a sentence."
904,2019-02-25T14:59:29.647100,Sasha,Personally I'd be thinking a `set` would be the easiest way to go.
904,2019-02-25T15:01:06.647300,Demetrice,So will this work? Although i imagine there's probably a much better way
904,2019-02-25T15:01:44.648100,Sasha,Afraid not... `in` just doesn't do that. You'd need to loop over each letter and check it one at a time.
904,2019-02-25T15:02:20.648700,Demetrice,"So if i'm looping then i can have it as one big string again, right?"
904,2019-02-25T15:02:35.648900,Sasha,Yes
904,2019-02-25T15:03:01.649300,Clemmie,also you don’t want to put the `= ''` in your method call. that is calling is_pangram with the  empty string every time
904,2019-02-25T15:03:22.649700,Clemmie,just call `is_pangram(sentence)`
904,2019-02-25T15:04:06.650000,Clemmie,:taco: <@Sasha>
904,2019-02-25T15:08:02.650100,Demetrice,Would this work?
904,2019-02-25T15:08:24.650900,Demetrice,"Also, doing it this way there's no longer a reason to be wary of duplicates in alphabet, right?"
904,2019-02-25T15:09:40.651800,Sasha,"I don't think string subtraction is a thing, unfortunately, in your `test -= i` line."
904,2019-02-25T15:09:56.652300,Demetrice,Oh. Man
904,2019-02-25T15:10:17.653200,Demetrice,Also i'm getting a syntax error for 'is not in'. How do we say that in python?
904,2019-02-25T15:10:28.653800,Carlo,"just ""not in"""
904,2019-02-25T15:10:34.654100,Carmen,^
904,2019-02-25T15:11:20.654900,Carlo,"""is"" is an identity test"
904,2019-02-25T15:15:36.656900,Demetrice,"So i rewrote it. But i think the second if statement is redundant, and doesn't solve the issue of things being out of order"
904,2019-02-25T15:16:25.658100,Clemmie,"<@Demetrice> you don’t need to do all of the work you are doing  (perhaps) if a pangram is defined as having at least every letter from the alphabet, but can have duplicates (an maybe even other stuff) you don’t need to create your alphabet. Conceptually all you need is to see if all of your test characters (the real alphabet) exist in  your sentence. If they do - return true, if you can’t find one - return false"
904,2019-02-25T15:16:40.658600,Clemmie,think about that a little and see if it changes your algorithm
904,2019-02-25T15:16:57.659100,Clemmie,"Then we can talk about more performant, pythonic ways to do it, if you want"
904,2019-02-25T15:27:50.659400,Alejandrina,This message was deleted.
904,2019-02-25T15:29:29.662100,Clemmie,you forgot `()` after your call to `lower` so `for i not in sentence` is trying to run on the build-in method `lower` not the string returned from a call to `lower()`
904,2019-02-25T15:29:48.662500,Lillia,That looks _much_ better
904,2019-02-25T15:30:06.663000,Lillia,"I recommend removing the `else`, it's confusing."
904,2019-02-25T15:30:08.663200,Clemmie,But otherwise that is exactly what I was hoping you would get
904,2019-02-25T15:30:24.663600,Clemmie,"If you want to go for really performant, take a look at `set` comparisons"
904,2019-02-25T15:31:18.663900,Demetrice,Hey thanks you guys a ton for all the help
904,2019-02-25T15:31:34.664300,Demetrice,I'm not sure what set comparrisions are but i'll do some reading on it really quickly
904,2019-02-25T15:31:50.664400,Clemmie,"^ this, just return true at the end of the function. If it were false it would have already short-circuited and returned"

904,2019-02-25T15:36:35.664900,Lillia,I do venvs; PyCharm's pretty good about picking them up.
904,2019-02-25T15:36:44.665100,Lillia,"Conda's probably ""better""."

904,2019-02-25T15:39:10.667300,Demetrice,I'm actually gonna be here all day. I have so much ground to cover
904,2019-02-25T15:39:18.667600,Carlo,don't worry
904,2019-02-25T15:39:51.668400,Demetrice,:taco: <@Lloyd> <@Carlo> <@Sasha> <@Lillia> Even my taco syntax was incorrect lol
904,2019-02-25T15:41:17.669000,Lillia,Starting a new job in a couple weeks; I will have to introduce this taco thing.
905,2019-02-25T15:29:26.662000,Clayton,What is the recommened choices for configuring the python interpreter for pycharm.   venv or conda for envs and for the system interpreter
906,2019-02-25T16:15:01.669500,Granville,Thanks!
907,2019-02-25T17:49:52.670000,Nikki,I'm having a git issue :confused:
907,2019-02-25T17:50:14.670700,Hiroko,git got you?
907,2019-02-25T17:50:29.671100,Nikki,I commit changes but got a warning a file was too big - I deleted it and tried again but it keeps saying the same error like the file is still there
907,2019-02-25T17:50:31.671300,Nikki,github
907,2019-02-25T17:51:06.671800,Nikki,i then did git stash and tried again but just getting the same
907,2019-02-25T17:51:37.672400,Nikki,is there a way to clear it and start again without losing my local changes
907,2019-02-25T17:52:35.672600,Hiroko,how big a file
907,2019-02-25T17:52:48.673000,Hiroko,git really isn’t made for large file storage
907,2019-02-25T17:53:05.673700,Hiroko,might want to either offload that elsewhere or check into Github Large File Support
907,2019-02-25T17:53:19.674200,Nikki,it was just a testing file - I didn't need it so just deleted it
907,2019-02-25T17:53:24.674400,Hiroko,"and when you deleted the file, did you delete it from the cache"
907,2019-02-25T17:53:46.674800,Hiroko,eg `git rm --cached &lt;file-name&gt;`?
907,2019-02-25T17:55:33.675300,Nikki,I tried that it I got a fatal path error no file found
907,2019-02-25T17:55:48.675500,Candra,git stash pop
907,2019-02-25T17:55:58.675800,Candra,then git rm --cached filename
907,2019-02-25T17:57:55.676100,Nikki,it's now saying no local changes
907,2019-02-25T17:57:56.676300,Nikki,ffs
907,2019-02-25T17:58:13.676700,Nikki,have I lost my work? I've not done any pull requests etc
907,2019-02-25T17:59:23.677000,Lillia,Did you checkout?
907,2019-02-25T17:59:28.677200,Nikki,no
907,2019-02-25T17:59:44.677600,Lillia,Did you stash and not pop?
907,2019-02-25T18:00:40.677800,Nikki,Yea I did a stash first
907,2019-02-25T18:01:03.678000,Lillia,Yeah so all your changes are stashed?
907,2019-02-25T18:01:31.678400,Lillia,So they wouldn't show up unless they are untracked
907,2019-02-25T18:02:02.678600,Nikki,what should I do now/
907,2019-02-25T18:02:34.679000,Nikki,unstash and then stash pop and start again?
907,2019-02-25T18:03:17.679400,Lillia,Yeah try to unstash; theoretically you shouldn't have been able to commit the too-big file
907,2019-02-25T18:04:32.680100,Lillia,"Oh `unstash` is equivalent to `pop`, if I understand what you're saying by `unstash`"
907,2019-02-25T18:05:19.680300,Nikki,no stash found
907,2019-02-25T18:05:40.680500,Lillia,:grimacing:
907,2019-02-25T18:06:33.680700,Nikki,oh dear
907,2019-02-25T18:07:13.681300,Nikki,this is one of those moments you learn a hard lesson
907,2019-02-25T18:07:25.681600,Nikki,I've not done a commit in over a week
907,2019-02-25T18:07:34.681900,Lillia,Ouch
907,2019-02-25T18:07:40.682200,Lillia,<http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/>
907,2019-02-25T18:07:47.682400,Nikki,is there anything else you can think of to try?
907,2019-02-25T18:08:10.682900,Lillia,"If it's not in stash and it's not sitting unstaged or committed, then no. git will happily delete things if you tell it to."
907,2019-02-25T18:09:30.684200,Nikki,doesn't make sense - I've just copied the file which I had opened and resaved it and git status is saying directory is clean nothing to commit
907,2019-02-25T18:09:42.684400,Lillia,"What do you mean ""resaved"""
907,2019-02-25T18:12:06.685100,Nikki,I don't know I'm confused lol
907,2019-02-25T18:12:26.685500,Lillia,Like in the IDE/editor?
907,2019-02-25T18:12:36.685900,Nikki,my local changes are still here so why doesn't git see them
907,2019-02-25T18:12:58.686200,Lillia,"Git won't lie, an editor/IDE might"
907,2019-02-25T18:16:41.686400,Nikki,there are defo there
907,2019-02-25T18:17:06.686900,Nikki,on my server where my git file is the changes are there but a git status says there is nothing
907,2019-02-25T18:17:11.687100,Nikki,wtf lol
907,2019-02-25T18:17:37.687600,Nikki,I've just added `# test` to the file and the change was picked up
907,2019-02-25T18:17:53.687900,Lillia,Sounds like the changes are already committed; can you do `git log -p`
907,2019-02-25T18:19:00.688200,Nikki,not sure what I'm looking at
907,2019-02-25T18:20:22.688800,Lillia,`-p` shows the changes; you can scroll down and look for the ones that you think are missing
907,2019-02-25T18:23:07.689000,Nikki,sadly nothing helpful
907,2019-02-25T18:23:34.689700,Lillia,Darn
907,2019-02-25T18:23:44.689900,Nikki,is there a way to just force add all files that haven't been modified
907,2019-02-25T18:24:04.690400,Nikki,my server seems fine just no changes in my repository on github
907,2019-02-25T18:24:38.690700,Lillia,I guess I'm confused as to the setup; I thought this was local.
907,2019-02-25T18:27:39.690900,Nikki,sorry mate
907,2019-02-25T18:27:46.691200,Nikki,one last message
907,2019-02-25T18:27:59.691500,Nikki,Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 2 commits.
907,2019-02-25T18:28:40.692300,Lillia,Oh you never pushed
907,2019-02-25T18:28:53.692700,Lillia,Unless you don't want to
907,2019-02-25T18:28:58.693000,Lillia,In which case you can soft reset
907,2019-02-25T18:29:00.693100,Nikki,this is basically my issue - when I've tried to push the change the 'big' file has caused an issue when I pushed it - so I deleted it and then tried again
907,2019-02-25T18:30:23.694400,Lillia,"Ah so deleting doesn't remove it from history, so it's still there. You'll get the warning even though it's ""deleted"". Do `git reset --soft HEAD~2` and then re-commit what you want."
907,2019-02-25T18:30:37.694700,Lillia,Don't forget the `--soft`
907,2019-02-25T18:30:52.695100,Lillia,Sorry this would have been avoided if I'd asked what you did originally
907,2019-02-25T18:32:24.695400,Nikki,so this will alter my git file only?
907,2019-02-25T18:32:34.695600,Nikki,I'm scared haha
907,2019-02-25T18:32:45.695800,Lillia,"Yes, `--soft` preserves the changes."
907,2019-02-25T18:33:09.696300,Lillia,`--hard` discards them
907,2019-02-25T18:34:05.697000,My,"if you did git add but didn't commit, your changes MIGHT be in the reflog"
907,2019-02-25T18:34:30.697600,My,be aware that digging in the reflog is for last-hope cases since it's kind of tricky
907,2019-02-25T18:34:32.697800,My,<http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/#panic>
907,2019-02-25T18:34:51.698000,Nikki,It's worked
907,2019-02-25T18:34:59.698300,Nikki,you are amazing
907,2019-02-25T18:35:12.698700,Nikki,thanks so much I was shitting myself lol
907,2019-02-25T18:35:59.699100,Lillia,I am more persistent than I am smart
907,2019-02-25T18:36:19.699500,Lillia,Glad nothing was lost :smile:
907,2019-02-25T18:36:29.699700,Nikki,me too. phew
908,2019-02-25T19:12:22.700400,Demetrice,So i don't even know how to conceptualize this solution. And it's supposed to be one of the easier ones
908,2019-02-25T19:12:45.700900,Demetrice,have any of you guys ever worked through the python track on <http://exercism.io|exercism.io>?
908,2019-02-25T19:17:10.702000,Maricruz,What's the recommended library for parsing xml these days? bs4?
908,2019-02-25T19:18:11.702800,Sasha,"<@Demetrice> not that site in particular, but I've had fun with Advent of Code and Project Euler recently. If you're looking for a hint, the channel can probably provide one if you post the problem."
908,2019-02-25T19:23:03.703300,Demetrice,I just don't really know where to start with this one. i understand that i'm probably creating a class. But i don't know how to meet the requirements
908,2019-02-25T19:23:42.703500,Demetrice,None
908,2019-02-25T19:24:54.704400,Sasha,"If you haven't already, have a look at the `random` library. It has some functions which will help."
908,2019-02-25T19:25:30.704800,Demetrice,So i imagined that i would use randint to meet the random requirement
908,2019-02-25T19:26:03.705700,Demetrice,But i'm not sure how to make sure they're unique. I guess i can do an if statement to where if they're equal to each other i have the program try again?
908,2019-02-25T19:27:13.706200,Sasha,"Yeah, you'll need to keep track of all the live names to compare against."
908,2019-02-25T19:38:03.706500,Demetrice,Does this line of code mean anything to you?
908,2019-02-25T19:38:21.706900,Demetrice,The test sheet has it and i don't know what to make of it
908,2019-02-25T19:38:22.707100,Demetrice,name_re = r'^[A-Z]{2}\d{3}$'
908,2019-02-25T19:38:34.707400,Demetrice,Is that the format to create the first random name assigned to each robot?
908,2019-02-25T19:42:17.708800,Sasha,"Yeah, that's a ""regular expression"". It says there should be two uppercase letters followed by three digits. Python's `re` library can match strings against those types of patterns, though you don't have to use it here."
908,2019-02-25T19:43:10.709100,Demetrice,"It sounds like it would make things easier tho, right?"
908,2019-02-25T19:43:29.709800,Demetrice,Is that the pythonic way to meet that requirement? What i don't understand is that the test document doesn't have re imported
908,2019-02-25T19:43:57.710300,Sasha,"Not really easier for you... it's good for checking the answers, but not creating the strings in the first place."
908,2019-02-25T19:44:12.710500,Demetrice,Okay that makes sense actually
908,2019-02-25T19:44:28.710900,Demetrice,It's looking to make sure it matches that format. But it's not going to create it on it's own thats my job
908,2019-02-25T19:44:36.711300,Sasha,Exactly.
908,2019-02-25T19:45:16.712000,Demetrice,So i guess i concatenate a string including random with all the numbers uppercased + rand int for the letters
908,2019-02-25T19:45:26.712400,Demetrice,But even after that i have to check to ensure it's unique
908,2019-02-25T19:45:39.712900,Demetrice,"And then i do all this in the section of the code where i'm creating the class, right?"
908,2019-02-25T19:45:46.713200,Demetrice,I think i'm too intimidated by it. I'm gonna give it a shot
908,2019-02-25T19:46:38.714000,Sasha,Baby steps. Start by writing a function to generate a random name. Then write some code to keep track of names and determine uniqueness. Then wrap it all in a class or whatever structure they want.
908,2019-02-25T19:54:45.714100,Demetrice,So is this a viable beginning?
908,2019-02-25T19:57:01.715400,Sasha,"The concept is good, but multiplication of strings gets you an exact copy, like `'a' * 2` is `'aa'`, rather than an additional random choice. The `[0-9]` syntax isn't supported either."
908,2019-02-25T19:57:44.715700,Demetrice,Was i supposed to use () instead of []?
908,2019-02-25T19:58:03.716300,Demetrice,So i have to copy and paste? Is there a prettier solution to that?
908,2019-02-25T19:59:04.716800,Demetrice,This is where i am currently
908,2019-02-25T19:59:21.717300,Sasha,"`randint()` takes two parameters, like `randint(0, 9)`. If you do `0-9`, you're subtracting."
908,2019-02-25T20:00:13.717900,Demetrice,Okay. I see that's goofy of me
908,2019-02-25T20:00:31.718400,Demetrice,"So fixing that it looks ugly. But it'll do the first part of what we need, right?"
908,2019-02-25T20:01:21.719200,Sasha,Almost. The `random.random()` function returns a number between 0 and 1. I think you want a different function to pick from a string of possibilities.
908,2019-02-25T20:05:07.719300,Demetrice,None
908,2019-02-25T20:06:16.720000,Sasha,"Cool, that looks good. (Note you have `WKYZ` at the end of the alphabet.)"
908,2019-02-25T20:11:05.721500,Carmen,"Wow, that's a first. I just went to look at the random module to see what other options there are for choice (I'm pretty sure there's a ""choose multiple times"" option), and I got a 503."
908,2019-02-25T20:11:09.721900,Carmen,`Error 503 All backends failed or unhealthy`
908,2019-02-25T20:11:35.722600,Demetrice,I'm trying to continue working but when i begin an if statement statement it's indenting like 8 times as much as normal. Why would that be?
908,2019-02-25T20:12:37.723300,Sasha,"Possibly an unclosed parenthesis in a previous line, so it's trying to continue that expression?"
908,2019-02-25T20:13:24.723800,Carmen,"`random.choices(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)` would help with DRY and code reuse."
908,2019-02-25T20:14:00.725000,Carmen,"Ignore `weights` and `cum_weights`, and you should be good."
908,2019-02-25T20:14:31.725500,Natosha,And how do I fix that?
908,2019-02-25T20:15:21.726100,Demetrice,You might have to update your environment variables in settings
908,2019-02-25T20:15:48.726800,Carmen,"Alternately, you might need to reinstall `python_dateutil`"
908,2019-02-25T20:15:59.727000,Natosha,"and to add, it says
```
No metadata found
```"
908,2019-02-25T20:16:16.727100,Demetrice,"So i'm now here. Truth be told i'm really bad at writing classes. And i know the syntax is probably all kinds of wrong, but are we heading in the right direction?"
908,2019-02-25T20:17:38.728100,Natosha,I tried to reinstall python_dateutil earlier but still I can't
908,2019-02-25T20:18:06.728600,Natosha,<@Demetrice> which env variables that I need to update?
908,2019-02-25T20:19:41.729400,Carmen,"<@Demetrice> I would refactor that name generation into a class method, for clarity and less code duplication."
908,2019-02-25T20:20:30.730500,Candra,`pip install --upgrade python_dateutil` should update it
908,2019-02-25T20:20:38.730700,Carmen,"Otherwise, that looks like a solid start, assuming it's generating names appropriately."
908,2019-02-25T20:21:42.732100,Carmen,"Did you intend to have the names generation inside the __init__ constructor, or was it supposed to be outside the class?"
908,2019-02-25T20:22:48.732600,Candra,"self.name == name is an equivalence check, not an assignment, just FYI"
908,2019-02-25T20:24:22.733600,Demetrice,Right it was only supposed one question mark. I think the meet the criteria for the test i want to have it inside the constructor
908,2019-02-25T20:24:35.734200,Natosha,<@Candra> still no luck
908,2019-02-25T20:24:48.734800,Demetrice,The default name is supposed to be what's assigned to the robot from the assembly line. So i don't think it's supposed to be something that happens when i call a method
908,2019-02-25T20:25:00.735300,Demetrice,I think it's supposed to be an attribute
908,2019-02-25T20:25:12.735500,Natosha,It affects the whole pip thing not just the ```python_dateutil```
908,2019-02-25T20:25:54.735900,Natosha,It looks like a metadata is missing
908,2019-02-25T20:26:01.736200,Natosha,so it can't proceed
908,2019-02-25T20:26:09.736600,Candra,<@Natosha> in bash do `pip freeze | grep python_dateutil` and tell me what version it says
908,2019-02-25T20:26:42.737000,Natosha,<@Candra> I'm using windows
908,2019-02-25T20:26:54.737400,Candra,Do you have git bash for windows
908,2019-02-25T20:26:57.737600,Candra,or just do pip freeze
908,2019-02-25T20:27:01.737900,Candra,and look for the package
908,2019-02-25T20:27:14.738200,Natosha,yeah I do have ubuntu subsystem
908,2019-02-25T20:27:24.738700,Natosha,but the env that I created is in windows
908,2019-02-25T20:27:27.738900,Candra,well just do pip freeze and find the package name and version
908,2019-02-25T20:27:39.739200,Natosha,it's 2.7.5
908,2019-02-25T20:28:13.739900,Candra,do `pip uninstall python_dateutil` and then `pip install python_dateutil==2.8.0`
908,2019-02-25T20:29:05.740200,Natosha,when I tried to uninstall the package
908,2019-02-25T20:29:12.740600,Demetrice,I need to make sure the global d_names updates. Is the return statement necessary?
908,2019-02-25T20:29:14.740900,Natosha,I'm getting the exception error
908,2019-02-25T20:29:24.741100,Candra,What is the exception
908,2019-02-25T20:29:32.741400,Candra,Copy what it says into here
908,2019-02-25T20:30:32.741900,Natosha,"this are the last line
```
    with open(path, 'rb') as stream:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '*\\envs\\data_analysis\\lib\\site-packages\\python_dateutil-2.7.5.dist-info\\RECORD'
```"
908,2019-02-25T20:31:41.742600,Candra,Oh wait do `pip install python-dateutil -U`
908,2019-02-25T20:32:05.743200,Sasha,"<@Demetrice> No, the `return` isn't necessary."
908,2019-02-25T20:33:24.743900,Natosha,<@Candra> still has an error
908,2019-02-25T20:33:33.744400,Demetrice,Okay nice. So i now have a class named robot and each instance of it is going to generate a new default name in the format the test wants
908,2019-02-25T20:33:35.744600,Natosha,I tried creating a new virtualenv
908,2019-02-25T20:33:49.745300,Natosha,and install new packages and it works fine
908,2019-02-25T20:34:03.745800,Natosha,I guess the virtualenv is destroyed
908,2019-02-25T20:34:03.745900,Candra,Yeah was gonna say just recreate it
908,2019-02-25T20:34:09.746100,Natosha,yeah hahaha
908,2019-02-25T20:34:18.746400,Candra,That's what they're there for :slightly_smiling_face:
908,2019-02-25T20:34:27.746600,Natosha,just have to replicate the packages that I installed
908,2019-02-25T20:35:04.747300,Natosha,"hahah, do you know how to remove an existing virtualenv?"
908,2019-02-25T20:36:30.748000,Demetrice,I think i just don't know how to interpret the second set of instructions. So for the second half after i call the reset method it wants it to be a new name
908,2019-02-25T20:36:43.748200,Demetrice,But not follow any pattern?
908,2019-02-25T20:39:47.749500,Corey,"I'm a newb, seems the while statement would fail with the first iteration. Is that correct?"
908,2019-02-25T20:44:42.750400,Demetrice,Oh don't sorry. I'm really new too. yet  somehow i wanna be job ready in a few weeks
908,2019-02-25T20:44:58.751000,Demetrice,The while statement is only there to make sure that the value that's randomly generated is unique
908,2019-02-25T20:45:09.751400,Corey,Did you try .appending the default_name to the d_names list initially?
908,2019-02-25T20:45:19.751600,Demetrice,So while it's not unique i want the program to try again
908,2019-02-25T20:46:04.752300,Natosha,<@Candra> I got it. Thanks man for the help :slightly_smiling_face:
908,2019-02-25T20:46:50.752700,Natosha,<@Demetrice> sorry for interrupting your convo earlier
908,2019-02-25T20:47:56.753200,Demetrice,Oh no you're fine. I felt bad. That's why i tried to not type as much while you where going
908,2019-02-25T20:48:31.753700,Demetrice,I can understand how frustrating issues like that can be
908,2019-02-25T20:50:04.754000,Corey,"<@Demetrice>     letters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'

    d_names = []

    default_name = random.choice(letters) + random.choice(letters) + str(random.randint(0,9))+ str(random.randint(0,9))+ str(random.randint(0,9))

    d_names.append(default_name)

    print(d_names)"
908,2019-02-25T20:51:15.755200,Corey,<@Demetrice> See the list chained to the built-in append() function? :slightly_smiling_face:
908,2019-02-25T20:51:15.755300,Demetrice,Well so i'm writing this all as part of a class. so i don't really want to print anything
908,2019-02-25T20:51:34.755800,Corey,"Oh, the print was just a test of the desired value"
908,2019-02-25T20:52:00.756500,Corey,It's just part of your total script from before.
908,2019-02-25T20:52:17.756800,Demetrice,I get what you're saying. You're just saying that i should write the last line a little differently
908,2019-02-25T20:52:28.757200,Demetrice,"I guess it would look better that way, Thanks"
908,2019-02-25T20:52:57.757700,Corey,The first four initialize the list.
908,2019-02-25T20:53:46.758100,Corey,How many elements would you like to store in the list?
908,2019-02-25T20:56:34.759200,Demetrice,It's not a fixed number. It's just supposed to pass this test
908,2019-02-25T20:56:56.760100,Demetrice,Have you ever gone through the tests on <http://exercism.io|exercism.io>? They've all been pretty difficult for me so far
908,2019-02-25T20:56:59.760200,Corey,"<@Demetrice> Enclose my line 4, the one employing the .append() function, in a loop to keep adding new values to your list."
908,2019-02-25T20:57:55.760700,Corey,Haven't noodled around on <http://exercism.io|exercism.io>
908,2019-02-25T20:59:13.762000,Corey,"In general though, I'd offer that in your initial code snippet above, an initial value nor subsequent values were not added to the list."
909,2019-02-25T20:14:11.725200,Natosha,"Hi Guys! I have a question. I'm trying to install a new packages with pip but when I'm trying to run it. I'm getting this error
```
Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: *******\\envs\\data_analysis\\lib\\site-packages\\python_dateutil-2.7.5.dist-info\\METADATA'

Any reason why I'm getting that error?"
910,2019-02-25T21:28:15.763500,Philip,"Given the dataset `[{'id': 1, 'name': 'John'}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'Mary'}]` what's the best approach to get the name of the id whose value is `n`?

910,2019-02-25T21:31:35.765200,Sasha,"If you're going to be doing the same operation repeatedly, it's probably worth it to build an index dict. But for a one-off, you don't have much choice but to scan through the entries one way or another, yeah."
910,2019-02-25T21:32:47.766200,Philip,"yes, the action would be done repeatedly. So I should just do `the_index = {i['id']: i for i in foo}` then `the_index.get(n)` right?"
910,2019-02-25T21:34:11.767400,Sasha,"Yep, that's what I meant. Nice!"
910,2019-02-25T21:34:18.767500,Philip,"Thanks for clarifying <@Sasha>, I was overthinking it too much like I'm missing out on something. :taco:"

913,2019-02-26T00:12:45.772200,Chuck,"What would people in here recommend for simple file logging for a transaction processing app? My app automates transactions through a windows desktop application and I want to capture logs such as:

```
yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi:ss -- xyz123 processed
yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi:ss -- abc098 not found
```
(where 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mi:ss' would be the date and time of the transaction)."
913,2019-02-26T00:13:42.772700,Chuck,`logzero` looks interesting -- has anyone used this?
913,2019-02-26T00:23:01.773400,Krista,<@Chuck> Is there some reason that the `logging` module won't work?
913,2019-02-26T00:27:43.774400,Chuck,"<@Krista> probably no reason at all, I don't know enough about it (yet) to know if it matches the 'simple' benchmark. But will definitely investigate, many thanks."
913,2019-02-26T00:30:51.775800,Krista,"<@Chuck> It's fairly robust, and is more than adequate for the rather simple example logs you provided. You are handed FileHandlers out of the box, and can even setup automatic file log rotation.

`logzero` looks interesting, though I've never used it; but it seems like overkill for your use case"
913,2019-02-26T00:33:18.777100,Chuck,"interesting, worth investigating -- I don't need rotating log files, I need log files 'attached' (by using the same filename aside from the "".log"" extension) to the batch files that are processed. I'm sure `logging` can do this as well."
913,2019-02-26T00:34:57.777900,Chuck,as in the batch file would be called something like `process_this_2019-02-26.csv` and the log file would be `process_this_2019-02-26.log`.

920,2019-02-26T10:21:45.809600,Jonas,Debug why. Print `repr()` of the password and ensure it's correct.
920,2019-02-26T10:22:10.810000,Jonas,Maybe there is a newline on the end. Maybe there is an extra character.

920,2019-02-26T10:23:42.810800,Nikki,"Q. Can I define my columns in Ajax loaded JSON?
A. This is not currently a native feature in DataTables (although it is likely to be added in future). Instead, you would need to load the JSON data using $.ajax and assign the column definition array using the columns option.

920,2019-02-26T10:24:25.811400,Nikki,I think that's only the data not the actual columns
920,2019-02-26T10:25:27.812500,Nikki,I have that currently set but I want to create a 'report builder' where the users can select different data points so the columns would need to be dynamic rather than predefined
920,2019-02-26T10:26:28.813200,Nikki,I'm using flask so I could do some kind of `if` statement with jinja but it feels a bit messy
920,2019-02-26T10:27:40.814200,Jorge,you could use the api to hide/show columns after you received your json data. although that could be kind of messy depending on how you implement it
920,2019-02-26T10:28:54.814600,Nikki,Yea not sure - shame you can't just define them in the JSON
920,2019-02-26T10:29:14.814900,Nikki,My js skills are not very good
920,2019-02-26T10:29:23.815200,Nikki,as in I have no js skills lol
920,2019-02-26T10:30:33.816200,Jorge,"i havent tried this in datatables, but you could wait to create the datatables object itself until you actually select your fields/receive your json"
920,2019-02-26T10:31:01.816700,Jorge,you'd also probably need to create the associated html at that time too
920,2019-02-26T10:31:36.817100,Nikki,"Yea, I'm wondering if Jinja conditions is the way to go"

928,2019-02-26T15:10:03.854700,Nikki,how do you know the key_name
928,2019-02-26T15:11:16.855300,Carmen,It's whatever private key you would use when connecting to that machine via a standard SSH session.
928,2019-02-26T15:11:22.855500,Hiroko,a key is a file in the ssh directory
928,2019-02-26T15:11:34.856100,Lillia,`ls ~/.ssh`
928,2019-02-26T15:11:39.856300,Hiroko,"public and private, with pub having a `.pub` suffix"

928,2019-02-26T15:12:07.857000,Carmen,"It will start with something like ""BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY"""
928,2019-02-26T15:12:27.857200,Nikki,Says: id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
928,2019-02-26T15:12:40.857700,Nikki,I did ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa as per that doc
928,2019-02-26T15:13:02.857900,Carmen,Then that's the keypair you want to use.
928,2019-02-26T15:13:10.858200,Carmen,The public part is `id_rsa.pub`.
928,2019-02-26T15:13:14.858400,Carmen,The private part is `id_rsa`
928,2019-02-26T15:13:35.858800,Carmen,You upload `id_rsa.pub` to any servers you want to SSH into.
928,2019-02-26T15:13:45.859200,Carmen,You keep `id_rsa` on your machine only and never share it with anyone.
928,2019-02-26T15:14:06.859700,Carmen,"Then when you want to SSH to the other machine, you pass the filename into SSH."
928,2019-02-26T15:14:41.860200,Nikki,Yea I added the content of id_rsa.pub into github
928,2019-02-26T15:15:14.860600,Nikki,so how do I do `git pull origin master`
928,2019-02-26T15:15:43.861100,Carmen,<https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent>
928,2019-02-26T15:15:46.861300,Carmen,Those 2 steps.
928,2019-02-26T15:15:58.861700,Carmen,"Make sure the ssh agent is running, and then ssh-add your private key to it."
928,2019-02-26T15:16:14.862200,Nikki,did those too
928,2019-02-26T15:16:33.862700,Carmen,"Then, assuming you've added the remote to your repo as `origin`, you should be able to `git pull origin` and so on."
928,2019-02-26T15:17:10.863100,Nikki,is that the part I'm missing added the report to repo
928,2019-02-26T15:17:15.863300,Nikki,How might I do that
928,2019-02-26T15:17:38.863800,Nikki,(seems like eveytime I think I'm getting 'good' someone schools me lol)
928,2019-02-26T15:18:04.864100,Carmen,`git remote` will show all of your remotes for the repo.
928,2019-02-26T15:18:10.864300,Carmen,You should have one listed as `origin`
928,2019-02-26T15:18:25.864800,Carmen,`git remote show origin` will give you the details of how it's configured.
928,2019-02-26T15:18:30.864900,Nikki,shows nothing
928,2019-02-26T15:18:48.865500,Nikki,"fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights

928,2019-02-26T15:18:50.865600,Carmen,"Then yes, you need to add the remote. Github has a help doc on that."

930,2019-02-26T19:13:28.871500,Marquita,how can i get public key from `server_cert`?
930,2019-02-26T19:13:44.871900,Marquita,"could you help me on this stuff?
```
The goal of mine was to get public key from server's certificate and do some work with this key and send this data back to the server and then the server decodes data using its private key of the certificate.
```"
930,2019-02-26T19:25:30.876900,Sasha,It looks like one way to do it is to request the binary form of the certificate from `getpeercert()` and then decode with a separate crypto library. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5789193/extracting-public-key-from-certificate-and-encrypting-data>  Before going down that path I would inspect the certificate dict you already have and make sure it doesn't happen to have a public-key field already... the documentation is not clear what exactly it's supposed to have.
930,2019-02-26T19:34:46.879100,Marquita,"<@Sasha> Thanks. the format of certificate i got is...
```
{""subject"": [[[""countryName"", ""AU""]], [[""stateOrProvinceName"", ""Some-State""]], [[""organizationName"", ""Internet Widgits Pty Ltd""]], [[""commonName"", ""<http://example.com|example.com>""]]], ""issuer"": [[[""countryName"", ""AU""]], [[""stateOrProvinceName"", ""Some-State""]], [[""organizationName"", ""Internet Widgits Pty Ltd""]]], ""version"": 1, ""serialNumber"": ""892A2683431F27CC"", ""notBefore"": ""Feb 26 21:13:24 2019 GMT"", ""notAfter"": ""Mar 28 21:13:24 2019 GMT""}
```"
930,2019-02-26T19:35:58.879700,Marquita,This is different from the result with `ssl.get_server_certificate`..
930,2019-02-26T19:37:09.881100,Marquita,"when using `ssl.get_server_certificate()` I have got this format
----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----

930,2019-02-26T19:39:26.882400,Marquita,"```
I want to do rsa encryption using server's certificate:
so the client will encrypt data by means of public key in the server's certificate
and the server will decrypt data by means of private key in the server's certificate
```"
930,2019-02-26T19:39:46.883000,Marquita,But but now i can't get public key of the certificate on the client side
930,2019-02-26T19:41:38.884000,Sasha,"Note that `getpeercert(binary_form=True)` will give you the binary form, from which you should be able to extract the public key."
930,2019-02-26T19:42:22.884600,Marquita,do you prefer to use `M2Crypto`?
930,2019-02-26T19:44:34.885100,Marquita,None
930,2019-02-26T19:44:39.885400,Sasha,I have no experience with it myself... I'm just going by the Stack Overflow answer.

933,2019-02-27T06:58:35.894600,Shawana,<@Arturo> it really depends on what type of project that is

934,2019-02-27T08:33:27.919600,Hiroko,I wonder if excluding the `constant_score` and `filter` blocks is the issue
934,2019-02-27T08:33:50.920200,Hiroko,"the follow up examples omit the full example and just target `range` and below, but that may be for brevity"

I have the ability to do my own work but just as an advice or guidence i ask this question at this channel as this channel name is HELP!!
934,2019-02-27T08:49:29.921600,Jennefer,"<@Hiroko> Thank you so much, you saved me:hugging_face:"
934,2019-02-27T08:50:40.921800,Hiroko,glad to help :slightly_smiling_face:
934,2019-02-27T08:50:48.922100,Hiroko,"I’m curious, how did you install that version?"
934,2019-02-27T08:58:17.925000,Cheri,"Yes, so essentially say I want to encrypt some data that came from a form in React. I want to encrypt it in Python (because of the implementation of what I’m working with is in Python)"
934,2019-02-27T08:58:39.925700,Cheri,So I literally have to run some functions at different stages
934,2019-02-27T08:59:04.926100,Clemmie,if so you will want to take a look at one of the python web frameworks for handling AJAX events and running the crypto algos you want. Take a look at any of django/flask/pyramid
934,2019-02-27T08:59:22.926600,Clemmie,Think carefully about what you are trying to do - the data will travel over the wire in plaintext
934,2019-02-27T08:59:42.927100,Cheri,Yes I have looked at that
934,2019-02-27T08:59:58.928000,Cheri,and it is not a solution that makes sense even when sending information over TLS
934,2019-02-27T09:00:13.928700,Jennefer,"<@Hiroko> I've followed that guide:
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/install/#installing-official-release>"
934,2019-02-27T09:00:16.929000,Cheri,I have to perform the encryption and re-encryption locally as I do not want the private key t o leave the system.
934,2019-02-27T09:00:35.929500,Clemmie,"when you mean locally, you mean on the server or the client?"
934,2019-02-27T09:00:35.929600,Cheri,Also I have the stack done in JS already so I don’t want to re=do it
934,2019-02-27T09:00:43.929800,Cheri,Client
934,2019-02-27T09:00:57.930400,Clemmie,"So, short of building a native app in python, you don’t have any options"
934,2019-02-27T09:01:21.931100,Clemmie,"If you want it to work in-browser, it is js or nothing"
934,2019-02-27T09:01:30.931300,Cheri,"Essentially I input some data say my phone number, I want to input that into a python function locally and get the output then send that output over the network"
934,2019-02-27T09:01:49.931600,Clemmie,You need a native python app for that
934,2019-02-27T09:02:26.932000,Cheri,Fair enough!
934,2019-02-27T09:02:29.932200,Cheri,Well thanks anyways!
934,2019-02-27T09:08:47.934700,Coleen,How can I import a module from a modules directory which is not a subdir of my source dir?
934,2019-02-27T09:10:22.935900,Ashley,<@Cheri> typically you would rely on the existing layers of encryption provided by things like HTTPS when you post form data to the server
934,2019-02-27T09:10:59.938300,Cheri,Yeah I was thinking of implementing TLS but that would still mean I have to send Alice’s private key over the network and the plaintext and that is too risky.
934,2019-02-27T09:11:11.938700,Coleen,"ie, my python file is in `/files/src/file.py` and it contains `from modules import mymod.py`. The module is in `/files/modules/mymod.py`."
934,2019-02-27T09:11:30.939300,Ashley,"Look into public key cryptography. If it didn't work, we wouldn't use it"
934,2019-02-27T09:11:59.940600,Coleen,I created `modules/__init__.py` but that doesn't seem to help.
934,2019-02-27T09:12:22.941600,Ashley,"The technology is already there when using HTTPS, so you don't need to worry about it"
934,2019-02-27T09:12:38.942400,Clemmie,"<@Ashley> I think <@Cheri> is - he wants to encrypt with the client user’s private key ultimately, and is right to not want to send that over the wire"
934,2019-02-27T09:12:47.942700,Cheri,I am using a very specific type of public key cryptography called Proxy Re-Encryption that’s why I need the functionality in the client side
934,2019-02-27T09:13:04.943000,Cheri,Exactly
934,2019-02-27T09:16:52.948200,Ashley,"<@Coleen> you want to make a ""package"" that you can ""install"" into your python environment. You've got the right idea with `__init__.py`, but make sure your package structure makes sense. You can even make multiple packages if you like. The ""install"" basically puts a copy of the package into the python's `site-packages` folder, which is where it looks for third-party packages when you try to import them.

Just a heads up, though. When you make a virtual environment, you're making a new copy of python that has its own `site-packages` folder. But that's a good thing."
934,2019-02-27T09:17:53.948500,Coleen,"I am using a conda environment already, because I have some external dependencies."
934,2019-02-27T09:20:01.950200,Ashley,"<@Coleen> conda can manage environments. But you should still make a package that can be installed, and then have conda install it to the environment it's managing for you"
934,2019-02-27T09:20:37.951300,Coleen,"I see, so the idea is to install my package into the same conda env?"
934,2019-02-27T09:21:31.952300,Ashley,"I'm unfamiliar with proxy re-encryption, so I won't be much help then :joy:"
934,2019-02-27T09:23:42.954400,Cheri,"Hahhaha no worries, essentially I just have to run some python code in a JS app"
934,2019-02-27T09:23:55.955300,Cheri,I’ll figure it out somehow! I’m sure someone else has had the same issue at some point!
934,2019-02-27T09:24:00.955600,Cheri,hehehe thakns for the input tho!!\
934,2019-02-27T09:25:32.957800,Ashley,"<@Coleen> you can make a ""package"" by having a folder with an `__init__.py` module in it and (usually) other python modules and packages as well. You can make it installable with `setuptool` and a `setup.py` file (this isn't usually inside your package, but is still bundled in the project's folder along with the package). A quick Google search should bring up a simple guide on how to make a `setup.py` file with `setuptools`"
934,2019-02-27T09:26:40.958100,Coleen,"Awesome, thanks <@Ashley>!"
934,2019-02-27T09:29:35.958200,Ashley,No problem! Good luck!
934,2019-02-27T09:44:46.960000,Chelsey,"I need to write some scripts but the machine they will run on only has python 2.6.6, and there's sadly no possibilty of getting 3.anything. They'll be fairly simple stuff, mostly string manipulation and spitting out .csv files for load elsewhere. Do I care about the version really, or is there anything I should know? I've not used 2.* at all to date - everything I have done has been python3."
935,2019-02-27T08:44:11.920800,Hilma,<@Mariah> this is a competition question!
936,2019-02-27T08:56:40.922900,Cheri,Hi! Does anyone have experience with running Python scripts within JavaScript. I am trying to implement some cryptography and I’ve read that CryptoJS is terrible
936,2019-02-27T08:57:29.923500,Clemmie,Do you want a user to interact with the web/JS and then do crypto stuff in python?
937,2019-02-27T09:20:51.951600,Coleen,"But how can I ""make"" the package?"
938,2019-02-27T09:46:37.960500,Karoline,is there a possibility of at least getting 2.7.x?
939,2019-02-27T10:15:08.960600,Carmen,"There have been multiple ways people have suggested how you should think about the problem to move towards a solution.

""the first step is to figure out your algorithm, just as pencil-and-paper steps. Forget about Python, but make sure you know how the problem is supposed to be solved at all.""
""take an easy shape, and go one step at a time

- what's your problem?
- what is the desired outcome?
- what do you already know?
- what do you need to know?""

You haven't showed us anything about what you've already tried, what parts you don't understand, any of the usual things that we need to help someone figure out their problems. Instead, you've been asking us to break it into small parts *for* you. We're more than happy to help solve specific problems you might have, but breaking up the overall problem into smaller tasks is part of the work of solving the problem. You have to be able to break things up into smaller tasks by yourself as part of programming. If you can't seem to do that for this problem, then you need to find a different problem. It's not that you're not cut out for Python or programming, you're just trying to solve a problem that's beyond your current skills, and you should find a different, easier problem to cut your teeth on and build up the mental skills you need to break up a large problem like this into smaller tasks."
939,2019-02-27T10:19:37.961400,Carmen,"It might be worth looking into compiling it all into a single executable. You could sneak in 3.x in there that way, if that's a possibility."

939,2019-02-27T10:51:55.962900,Alvina,process_chunk is a separate function within the same class - any idea how I can reference it?
939,2019-02-27T10:52:42.963600,Melynda,"Seems more like you're trying to serialize… something, when you shouldn't be. How are you executing that code? Celery or something like it (tasks runner)?"

939,2019-02-27T10:53:13.964600,Alvina,but I first made the functions in a normal Python script / jupyter notebook to test it

939,2019-02-27T10:53:44.965800,Alvina,I added more lines of the code for clarity
939,2019-02-27T10:54:09.965900,Alvina,None
939,2019-02-27T10:54:29.966800,Alvina,process_chunk is a function which is just sending compressed CSV files to a REST API
939,2019-02-27T10:54:30.967000,Melynda,"&gt; Note When an object is put on a queue, the object is pickled and a background thread later flushes the pickled data to an underlying pipe. This has some consequences which are a little surprising, but should not cause any practical difficulties – if they really bother you then you can instead use a queue created with a manager.

939,2019-02-27T11:01:25.968800,Alvina,seems like that might be the approach I will need to take
939,2019-02-27T11:01:36.969300,Alvina,a bit messier but if it works then I'll be happy
939,2019-02-27T11:04:56.969900,Melynda,"I think you need to make your iterable (job_zip) pickle-able, which it isn't at the minute since it's a bunch of itertools callables?"
939,2019-02-27T11:07:37.970400,Alvina,moving the function outside of the class and then adding self.process_chunk = process_chunk to __init__ worked
939,2019-02-27T11:09:02.971600,Alvina,"yeah - should I replace the job_zip? I can add a += count, and the hook, token, stream_id, and execution_id are all static"

939,2019-02-27T11:10:25.972900,Alvina,then chunks is just the output of that function which reads a big csv file and compresses it into 50-100MB chunks before sending it
939,2019-02-27T11:13:49.974000,Melynda,"Here's what I was testing: <https://gist.github.com/d17e36c1674238725a8e9b06ef955c43>
I don't think having the called method in a class in inherently _wrong_, but the iterable (and possibly all locals within the pool call?) must be pickleable."

939,2019-02-27T11:26:16.980700,Hiroko,"so if you’re not returning anything explicitly, the return type is `None`"
939,2019-02-27T11:26:26.980800,Sasha,"I would expect that `r` would remain undefined if an exception is thrown, since the interpreter jumps out of the `get()` call prematurely."
939,2019-02-27T11:30:48.981100,Demetrice,So i think the problem is my final while loop. I was able to test that words.split() creates a list for me. But i was wanting to do was add the first character of each of those list entries to result. However it's still returning everything
939,2019-02-27T11:33:04.982200,Sasha,"The trouble is that your `for y in x` loop is completely inside your `while` loop, so it goes through the whole word before the `while` has a chance to stop it."
939,2019-02-27T11:33:39.982800,Lillia,Misread whoops
939,2019-02-27T11:34:17.983600,Sasha,"A handy trick is that strings are addressable like lists, so `str[i]` is the `i`th character."
939,2019-02-27T11:35:05.984200,Demetrice,"Right right so if i'm looking for the first character all i have to do is ask it to return str[0], right?"
939,2019-02-27T11:35:14.984400,Sasha,Bingo.
939,2019-02-27T11:52:41.985400,Demetrice,"So i had to change it to this because it was failing cases where the word started with not a letter. But now it's failing cases where there's a  hyphenated word like metal-oxide cause it'll miss the ""o"" I know i could iterate the whole string looking for the '-' but i'm not sure what i'd do after that. Is there a more beautiful solution?"
939,2019-02-27T11:55:46.986500,Lillia,You may want to look into using <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha>
939,2019-02-27T11:56:05.986900,Carlo,"<@Demetrice> you could remove non-letter characters, I guess?"
939,2019-02-27T11:56:29.987600,Lillia,Just so you don't have to keep having the list of letters
939,2019-02-27T11:57:23.988900,Genesis,anyone know how to do that in sql?
939,2019-02-27T11:58:10.989500,Melynda,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; re.compile(r'[^\w]').split('This is a test of oft-difficult magic')
['This', 'is', 'a', 'test', 'of', 'oft', 'difficult', 'magic']```"
939,2019-02-27T11:58:52.990300,Jonas,That kind of thing is going to be almost impossible
939,2019-02-27T11:58:53.990400,Melynda,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; ''.join([word[0] for word in re.compile(r'[^\w]').split('This is a test of oft-difficult magic')])

939,2019-02-27T11:59:13.990800,Jonas,Ideally you'd model your database to not need queries like that.
939,2019-02-27T12:00:22.991400,Genesis,"ya, it would be easy in code, but the problem is I am trying to do metrics in grafana, so its getting a little messy :wink:"
939,2019-02-27T12:00:41.991500,Demetrice,Thanks! I was able to clean it up a bit with that. I thought there must have been a better way. So now my core code looks better. But i still need to think of a solution to that problem
939,2019-02-27T12:07:23.992100,Lillia,"If I were you, I'd break this down into two parts: getting the list of words (without symbols), and appending the first letters. The second part is easy (you already did it). I'd look into splitting on multiple characters, for example. Split on both whitespace and hyphens."
939,2019-02-27T12:08:05.992600,Demetrice,Here i'll put it back in the main chat. I thought i had something but i might be on the wrong train of thought again
939,2019-02-27T12:09:02.992800,Demetrice,"So now python is telling me it has an issue with the way i'm using isalpha. But i just tested that. I think it's issue is with something else i did. What i was thinking was i would replace the ""-"" with a white space then try to re-split it. That may not be ideal"
939,2019-02-27T12:09:44.993300,Demetrice,the x.replace on line 7 should be x.split
939,2019-02-27T12:11:14.993600,Lillia,Do your replacement before anything else
939,2019-02-27T12:11:26.993900,Lillia,Because you are trying to split on those spaces

939,2019-02-27T12:11:53.994800,Melynda,<@Demetrice> did my replies in this thread not work for you? <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1551286361985400>
939,2019-02-27T12:14:13.995600,Demetrice,Honestly i didn't even see that. It went up top for some reason. I'm looking at it now. It looks so much simpler than mine
939,2019-02-27T12:16:39.996400,Demetrice,You did it in one line of code. :anguished::upside_down_face: what does the [^\w] mean?  How does it know how to look for words like that?
939,2019-02-27T12:18:57.997000,Lillia,"It's ""word character"" in regex, it'll split on anything that isn't alphanum or underscore"
939,2019-02-27T12:20:46.998600,Melynda,"The technology is called regular expressions, often shortened to regex, or even `re` since that's the name of the module in Python. They're _super_ useful, though quite hard to read and write. There's _lots_ written about them online. :slightly_smiling_face:"
939,2019-02-27T12:21:12.999100,Melynda,You can play with them on sites like <http://regexr.com/4987v|regexr.com/4987v>
939,2019-02-27T12:22:02.999900,Demetrice,I see. So that would really solve this problem instantly. I've been trying to fix my version too for practice but it's just not picking doing what i want. My logic must be off
939,2019-02-27T12:22:07.000200,Lillia,"This looks like it will replace <http://regex101.com|regex101.com> for me, thanks!"
939,2019-02-27T12:23:00.000500,Lillia,Do you still need `if y[0].isalpha():` if you've removed the hyphens?
939,2019-02-27T12:23:30.000800,Sasha,"I think `replace()` returns a modified copy of the string, rather than changing the original."
939,2019-02-27T12:24:05.001000,Melynda,"Indeed, remove line 3, change 4 to `for y in words.replace('-', ' ').split():` and it works"
939,2019-02-27T12:24:11.001200,Lillia,"Yeah you can just do `for y in words.replace('-', ' ').split():`"
939,2019-02-27T12:24:30.001400,Melynda,Great minds think alike! :smile:

939,2019-02-27T12:30:50.002500,Demetrice,Now in order to pass i need to make my result uppercase
939,2019-02-27T12:30:54.002700,Demetrice,But result.upper isn't working
939,2019-02-27T12:31:10.002900,Demetrice,I'm trying it at different stages of the code looking for the desired result
939,2019-02-27T12:31:20.003100,Melynda,"Define ""isn't working""?"
939,2019-02-27T12:31:34.003300,Melynda,"It definitely _works_: ```&gt;&gt;&gt; 'test'.upper()
'TEST'```"
939,2019-02-27T12:32:09.003500,Demetrice,So i wanted it all in caps so i tried changing this to result += y[1]. to result += y[1].upper()
939,2019-02-27T12:32:13.003700,Demetrice,But it didn't seem to change anything
939,2019-02-27T12:32:34.003900,Demetrice,Oh i needed to change both i think
939,2019-02-27T12:33:13.004200,Lillia,You shouldn't have to reference `y[1]` anywhere anymore
939,2019-02-27T12:33:24.004400,Lillia,All your words will be alpha numeric only now
939,2019-02-27T12:33:51.004600,Demetrice,Yeah okay then some of this code is redundant hang on
939,2019-02-27T12:35:37.004800,Demetrice,"Well i think i need it for this test case specifically. Because otherwise it'll return a blank space for the 3rd word ""The Road _Not_ Taken"""
939,2019-02-27T12:35:55.005000,Demetrice,"""The Road _Not_ Taken"""
939,2019-02-27T12:36:01.005200,Demetrice,The not is nested in underscores
939,2019-02-27T12:36:08.005400,Lillia,`split()` will handle that
939,2019-02-27T12:36:13.005600,Lillia,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; 'a  a'.split()
['a', 'a']

939,2019-02-27T12:36:37.005800,Lillia,Oh you need to replace the underscores too
939,2019-02-27T12:36:43.006000,Lillia,Forgot you weren't doing that
939,2019-02-27T12:37:32.006200,Lillia,"This is why you should use the regex solution, by the way. You can specify `[^a-zA-Z]` to split on all non-letters."

942,2019-02-27T15:36:18.028600,Coleen,its just that in my code the iterator was empty
942,2019-02-27T15:36:29.028900,Coleen,so the last print was failing
942,2019-02-27T15:36:49.029100,Coleen,loop was still fine though
942,2019-02-27T15:37:54.029800,Lillia,Yeah that's a bit dangerous since `val` will be undefined; may be safer to have a default for if it's empty.
942,2019-02-27T15:38:25.030000,Coleen,yup
942,2019-02-27T15:40:32.030300,Coleen,or an assert len(iterator)
942,2019-02-27T15:41:50.030600,Clemmie,Don’t use the assert
942,2019-02-27T15:42:00.030900,Clemmie,It is possible to skip asserts with command line flags
942,2019-02-27T15:44:11.031600,Clemmie,In this case not the worst thing. But I have seen code where asserts were used to control flow logic and would have blown up catastrophically

The intended usage is:

```

or

./genconfig.py --discovery 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.1

```
Conects to above ips and do discovery. It will get the list of ips from the clusters to which the ips belong
```


Code:
```
    argp = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=""Generate configuration for prometheus"")
    group = argp.add_mutually_exclusive_group(required=True)
    
    group.add_argument('servers', help=""List of nodes to configure, separated by space"", nargs='*', type=str, metavar='node_ip')
    group.add_argument('--discovery', nargs='*', help='Node(s) to connect to and do discovery')
```

So I want them to be mutually exclusive but at least one or the other is required.

I get the error:

```

945,2019-02-27T18:02:21.039600,Jennifer,Does this mean I can't have the positional argument as mutually exclusive with an optional?
945,2019-02-27T18:03:23.040300,Lillia,Does the second one still generate a config?
945,2019-02-27T18:03:41.040700,Lillia,With `--discovery`
945,2019-02-27T18:04:03.041400,Jennifer,Yes. It just generates the config from the values discovered from the remote server as opposed to list passed as positional args.
945,2019-02-27T18:04:37.042000,Lillia,I'd consider making `discovery` just a store_true argument
945,2019-02-27T18:04:50.042300,Lillia,Then you have `if discovery: .... else: ....`
945,2019-02-27T18:05:42.043400,Jennifer,I will definitely try that. But I am still wondering if I can't use the positional as mutually exclusive.
945,2019-02-27T18:05:42.043500,Lillia,"Because the list of IPs exists for both, right?"
945,2019-02-27T18:05:50.043700,Jennifer,Correct.
945,2019-02-27T18:06:32.044200,Lillia,Yeah I'd think you should be able to do that if `required=True` exists for the `add` call

954,2019-02-28T05:18:56.028900,Jordon,sorta a networking question but interacting the with 0.0.0.0:8080 on firebox WITHIN the VM is SOOOOO slow. Wondering if I could just use chrome on mny Host (OSX) machine
954,2019-02-28T05:49:02.029900,Karoline,if you set up the vm networking to be accessible from the host you can just call into the ip of the VM
954,2019-02-28T05:51:06.031300,Karoline,"one of the easiest ways to do that is just to set up the vm's networking as bridged and it will get an ip similar to your host machine's ip, and you can check it on the vm, then call it from your browser."

955,2019-02-28T07:02:55.062100,Valeri,Interesting
955,2019-02-28T07:04:07.062800,Valeri,What's you python version?
955,2019-02-28T07:04:09.062900,Rosetta,My discord bot is literally:
955,2019-02-28T07:04:12.063100,Rosetta,"```import discord

TOKEN = 'XXXXXXXXXX'

client = discord.Client()

@client.event
async def on_message(message):
    # we do not want the bot to reply to itself
    if message.author == client.user:
        return

    if message.content.startswith('!hello'):
        msg = 'Hello {0.author.mention}'.format(message)
        await client.send_message(message.channel, msg)

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print('Logged in as')
    print(client.user.name)
    print(client.user.id)
    print('------')

client.run(TOKEN)```"
955,2019-02-28T07:04:39.063300,Rosetta,Python 3.6.5
955,2019-02-28T07:06:17.064200,Hiroko,"<@Faustina> since tht data is coming in from the client, can’t you work with that to clean up the input?"
955,2019-02-28T07:07:01.065100,Hiroko,"looked at your example data.  IMO, if the client is sending malformed data with those weird UTF chars,"
955,2019-02-28T07:07:23.065600,Hiroko,"like `""<http://www.example.com/ex�mple>""` for what should be a simple `a` character"
955,2019-02-28T07:07:34.065900,Hiroko,that’s more a client issue than a server side issue
955,2019-02-28T07:07:47.066100,Faustina,I'm thinking about running my dict with request_data through this code <https://gist.github.com/chris-hailstorm/4989643>
955,2019-02-28T07:08:06.066500,Hiroko,are you using pythonn 2 or 3?
955,2019-02-28T07:08:10.066800,Faustina,3.7
955,2019-02-28T07:08:13.067100,Hiroko,gotcha
955,2019-02-28T07:08:41.067400,Hiroko,"&gt;&gt;&gt;The JSON spec (<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt>) -- “JSON text SHALL
    be encoded in Unicode”.  For apps that don’t use unicode, this function
    walks through all levels of a JSON data structure and converts each item
    to ASCII"
955,2019-02-28T07:09:15.068200,Hiroko,"because if a client can’t be bothered to send in well formatted data that matches to the standard, why handle the edge cases?"
955,2019-02-28T07:09:42.068600,Hiroko,"unless this is a _really_ high paying client, I’d push back"
955,2019-02-28T07:12:00.070700,Valeri,<@Rosetta> This should have worked right
955,2019-02-28T07:12:15.071300,Valeri,You're sure you're not messing up your virtualenvs?
955,2019-02-28T07:12:49.072300,Rosetta,"As far as I know. I tried this step by step on 2 macs, a raspberry pi and also at my work incase it's a network issue"
955,2019-02-28T07:13:24.073100,Faustina,"I'm like 99% sure that those requests comes from automated bots, so you suggest just drop those requests instantly without saving? But again how to detect that that those chars is is not formatted well? And on DFR I set that to accept only 'STRICT_JSON': True, and when api receives those, I assume it's valid json data"
955,2019-02-28T07:13:51.073700,Hiroko,"well, the error will raise an exception"
955,2019-02-28T07:14:09.074300,Faustina,"My idea was to json.dumps that dict, and then json.loads, but if api accepts those values, that means it's valid and there wil be no errors"
955,2019-02-28T07:14:15.074500,Hiroko,and you can handle that and return a 400
955,2019-02-28T07:14:26.074700,Hiroko,exactly
955,2019-02-28T07:14:48.075200,Hiroko,"handle the well formed requests, return errors when things go wrong"
955,2019-02-28T07:15:06.075500,Hiroko,"thing is, DRF already handles the transform to a dict"
955,2019-02-28T07:15:26.076000,Hiroko,"so if something’s screwy there, its a pretty small edge case that IMO is not worth handling"
955,2019-02-28T07:15:43.076600,Hiroko,"so if you get an error returned from that, just toss back a 400 bad request error code"
955,2019-02-28T07:17:07.077100,Valeri,<@Rosetta> Lemme try your code on my machine
955,2019-02-28T07:17:47.077200,Faustina,"So assume just wrap it into try except blocks, and that's all?"
955,2019-02-28T07:18:59.077600,Hiroko,"I’d do a 400, not a 404"
955,2019-02-28T07:19:09.078000,Hiroko,http spec says a 404 is not found
955,2019-02-28T07:19:12.078200,Hiroko,400 is bad request
955,2019-02-28T07:19:22.078600,Faustina,"Yeah, just misspelled, meant 400"
955,2019-02-28T07:19:25.078800,Hiroko,:thumbsup:
955,2019-02-28T07:19:35.079200,Hiroko,"that’s the general idea, yes"
955,2019-02-28T07:20:27.079900,Hiroko,<https://stackoverflow.com/a/46493137/214892>
955,2019-02-28T07:21:10.080300,Hiroko,I’d do what that answer says
955,2019-02-28T07:21:20.080600,Hiroko,and you can see the code for ValidationError at <https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework/blob/master/rest_framework/exceptions.py#L142-L158>
955,2019-02-28T07:21:32.081100,Hiroko,maybe ParseError would be better
955,2019-02-28T07:25:41.081300,Faustina,"But now I'm kind of have another issue, I already have few try except cases, and if MaxmindError fails as wel, will it go to second except clause, and execute DataError?"
955,2019-02-28T07:25:48.081800,Faustina,Will definetely looks at your examples
955,2019-02-28T07:27:28.082200,Jonas,"No, exceptions don't chain like that "
955,2019-02-28T07:30:25.083700,Karoline,That's valid
955,2019-02-28T07:30:56.084600,Faustina,"But you can chain few except with different errors, so I assumed that it should be valid"
955,2019-02-28T07:31:34.085400,Karoline,It's only useful in the case where you want to have different handling for different types of exceptions.
955,2019-02-28T07:33:00.086000,Faustina,"So if I understand you correctly, it'll only fire MaxmindError, and misses all other except cases?"
955,2019-02-28T07:35:28.086500,Karoline,"well, if it is a `DataError`, it will fire that."
955,2019-02-28T07:35:53.086600,Wilhelmina,Let me check again
955,2019-02-28T07:36:04.086900,Karoline,"(or the others as well, of course)"
955,2019-02-28T07:36:55.087600,Hiroko,But only one exception handler will be active
955,2019-02-28T07:40:42.089900,Wilhelmina,"<@Shawana> recording MPEG <http://take.ms/G9gU7>
edit: not able to reproduce, maybe I'm doing something wrong ?"
955,2019-02-28T07:41:36.090300,Wilhelmina,I'm on `macOS 10.14.3 (18D109)`
955,2019-02-28T07:44:27.090500,Faustina,"I'm kind of confused already, how to deal with it. So I assume I can wrap few exceptions in a single line, but again I'm returning creating in exception, so how to raise that exception message?"
955,2019-02-28T07:46:09.091800,Karoline,"You might need to rephrase the question - I'm not 100% sure what you are asking - but in your original code snipper - if there is a `MaxmindError` it will just return the value of `site.headers_set.create(request_data=request_data)`, but if there are any of `DataError, headers_model.DoesNotExist, ParseError`, it will raise a `ValidationError`"
955,2019-02-28T07:46:37.092300,Shawana,could you test with another application open in the background  - and with just clicking tthe two arrows twice after opening the app? sorry for inconvenience and thanks for your efford to help me!
955,2019-02-28T07:47:17.093000,Yaeko,"I might misunderstand the question, but you can just `try / except` blocks in the `except`"
955,2019-02-28T07:47:49.093500,Yaeko,"```
try:
  country_code = get_country_code(ip)
except MaxmindError:
    try:
        return site.headers_set.create(request_data=request_data)
    except (DataError, headers_model.DoesNotExist, ParseError):
        raise serializers.ValidationError(""human readable error message here"")
```"
955,2019-02-28T07:51:20.096000,Wilhelmina,sure
955,2019-02-28T07:53:30.097900,Faustina,"<@Yaeko> though about it as well, and I think I'll go this route. <@Jonas> I keep those logs for about 1-2months, and then delete those. I don't just keep those as logs, those are related to 2 more models, so I can check all that data in one place I mean in django-admin dashboard. My examples, was quite heavily stripped down with models values, and serializers values as well."

956,2019-02-28T07:08:07.066600,Faustina,which I think should fix those issues
956,2019-02-28T07:08:45.067600,Hiroko,"IMO, why bother?"

I need to do something like this:
from script3 import foo"
958,2019-02-28T09:55:36.103500,Mica,you could do abs imports or convert one of the modules to an installable package?
958,2019-02-28T09:55:45.103800,Mica,also don't forget the `__init__.py` files :stuck_out_tongue:
958,2019-02-28T10:04:16.106700,Ashley,"Yeah, you can use `__init__.py` to add stuff to the namespace for a package, and give yourself a shortcut. It's not necessarily more efficient in terms of performance, but can help make your imports cleaner/more sensible"

959,2019-02-28T11:11:06.114400,Alvina,does the psql command need to be a single string instead of a list?
959,2019-02-28T11:29:02.116100,Ashley,<@Alvina> use SQLAlchemy instead. It's a much easier interface to work with
959,2019-02-28T11:30:35.117500,Claudine,"i like the whimsical nature of that haha, but i agree with <@Ashley> there are some nice modules out there that will make your life much easier if you have the option of using them"
959,2019-02-28T11:39:37.121000,Alvina,<@Ashley> this is for bulk exporting large amounts of data (10-50 million rows) on a schedule
960,2019-02-28T11:29:50.116600,Claudine,ooooeee lol trying to do python+SQL through bash commands?
960,2019-02-28T11:30:56.117700,Hiroko,agreed
960,2019-02-28T11:31:11.118100,Hiroko,"effectively, this approach is making your life much harder than it needs to be"
960,2019-02-28T11:32:16.118400,Claudine,props for attempting it though
960,2019-02-28T11:32:40.118800,Claudine,"as they say: `To a man with a hammer, the world is a nail`"
960,2019-02-28T11:35:09.119500,Jame,"The past couple of years I've preferred `if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem begins to look like your thumb`"
960,2019-02-28T11:37:15.120100,Clemmie,I like `most people would be surprised by just how much you can do with a hammer`
960,2019-02-28T11:39:46.121400,Alvina,COPY is much faster
960,2019-02-28T11:39:59.121900,Alvina,and PSQL allows me to copy from a remote server to another file location
960,2019-02-28T11:40:20.122300,Claudine,are you moving entire tables? or just a set of rows from a table?
960,2019-02-28T11:40:26.122600,Alvina,rows from a table
960,2019-02-28T11:40:29.123000,Claudine,oof
960,2019-02-28T11:40:36.123400,Claudine,i do a lot of shifting around entire tables
960,2019-02-28T11:41:03.124200,Ashley,"<@Alvina> SQLAlchemy can be used as an interface for multiple DBs, including postgresql"
960,2019-02-28T11:41:17.124700,Alvina,"yeah - not the full table in all cases (unless I do a material view), otherwise I select specific columns and do some joins to dump to a file"
960,2019-02-28T11:41:26.125200,Alvina,which is then uploaded in bulk to a visualization service
960,2019-02-28T11:41:39.125800,Alvina,it is a full replacement of data though (dimensions can change historically)
960,2019-02-28T11:41:49.126000,Ashley,just saying you can use it to work with psql instead of going through bash
960,2019-02-28T11:42:14.126400,Alvina,"ahh, i'll check using psql with it"
960,2019-02-28T11:42:33.126800,Ashley,there's should be a few guides out there for exactly what you want to do
960,2019-02-28T11:45:49.128000,Alvina,"seems like it is using psycopg2 which I am familiar with and use a lot (copy_to, copy_from, copy_expert, and execute_values)"
960,2019-02-28T11:47:27.128800,Alvina,"i believe the \copy command in psql is faster though (""psql is the fastest client out there. The reason is because it's in C (as opposed to others that have many layers of stuff to present or translate data), its TCP messages are minimal."")"

964,2019-02-28T13:53:09.143900,Claudine,for that pattern specifically. `.*\/(.*)`
964,2019-02-28T13:53:21.144200,Claudine,that would capture everything after the slash
964,2019-02-28T13:54:49.145700,Claudine,"`.*` matches as many of any character it can up until `\/` which is your forward slash, the backslash is just escaping it because it's a special character, then the `(.*)` will match everything else til the end of the string and put it in a capture group"

964,2019-02-28T13:59:15.149200,Angele,Thanks <@Ashley>. Btw is the os module platform dependent?
964,2019-02-28T13:59:15.149300,Claudine,i love regex
964,2019-02-28T13:59:32.149600,Angele,I treat it as a necessary evil :wink:

964,2019-02-28T14:00:08.150400,Claudine,i like to use it whenever i can wherever i can

964,2019-02-28T14:02:57.152900,Claudine,they were so terrible a regex channel was created to quarantine me
964,2019-02-28T14:03:03.153100,Claudine,mighty and terrible
964,2019-02-28T14:04:37.153900,Claudine,the first time i made a regex that returned a `pattern to long` error i had to reevaluate my life
964,2019-02-28T14:05:24.154300,Clemmie,o.O --- TIL
964,2019-02-28T14:11:17.156400,Claudine,"well it was a sort of dumb situation haha, I was generating some dynamic patterns and had an unwieldy number of alternations"
964,2019-02-28T14:11:39.156900,Claudine,"it was poor design, no fault of the parser really"
964,2019-02-28T14:12:51.157800,Carmen,"Well, yeah, I figured there was something dynamic going on there, but I can see legitimate cases where you'd use a regex that's really long."
964,2019-02-28T14:13:31.158500,Claudine,"yea for sure, in this case it was some location focused NLP and i needed to filter a dynamic list of towns"
964,2019-02-28T14:13:53.158900,Claudine,worked well until the list of towns was in the 10s of thousands
964,2019-02-28T14:14:47.159800,Claudine,given the choice i probably wouldn't have built a regex based NLP system but sometimes you inherit some projects that are wonky as fuck
965,2019-02-28T14:09:42.154600,Carmen,...Get a better regex parser?
965,2019-02-28T14:10:12.155600,Carmen,"Joking aside, that sounds like the sort of ""what the frak?"" situation that shouldn't really come up with a fully-general regex parser."
965,2019-02-28T14:19:52.160700,Carmen,"Well, the other thing is that what works at a small scale sometimes doesn't work at a large scale. They probably designed the original system and thought about the trade-off, but weren't using it for a massive dataset like that."
966,2019-02-28T18:49:23.165800,Jennifer,"I have 2 functions:
```def function_one(bla)
    do something 
    return a, b, c

def function_two(par1, par2, par3, par4)
    do something_else
    return x```

I would like for function 1 pass the result to fuction 2 like this:

```my_variable = fuction_two(function_one(x), foo)```

I get error:
```
TypeError: function_two() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'par3' and 'par4'
```

What's the right way?"
966,2019-02-28T18:51:14.167700,Jennifer,"In other words, I would like the return from function_one (a, b, c) to be the input of function 2 plus one more argument.

a = par1
b = par2
c = par3
something_else = par4"
966,2019-02-28T18:51:21.168000,Sasha,"You want the `*` operator to unpack the tuple into parameters... `function_two(*function_one(x), foo)`."
966,2019-02-28T18:51:27.168200,Carmen,^
966,2019-02-28T18:51:39.168300,Jennifer,Let me try.
966,2019-02-28T18:52:43.168500,Jennifer,<@Sasha> it worked like a charm. Thank you SO MUCH! :slightly_smiling_face:
966,2019-02-28T18:53:12.168700,Sasha,:+1:
966,2019-02-28T18:53:33.168900,Jennifer,"Out of curiosity if I wanted just a subset of the return values? (the first, or second, or first and third?)"
966,2019-02-28T18:54:17.169100,Sasha,"You should be able to slice them like a regular list or tuple, like `function_one(x)[1:2]`."
966,2019-02-28T18:54:58.169300,Sasha,Or index for single values `[1]`.
966,2019-02-28T18:56:32.169500,Sasha,"The ""first and third"" case is a little tricky to avoid calling the function twice, though. Can be done with a comprehension, I think, but easier to just use an intermediate variable."
966,2019-02-28T18:57:41.169700,Carmen,Slice with a step of 2 would probably do for the first and third case.
966,2019-02-28T18:58:08.169900,Carmen,Though then you're starting to run into code readability issues and should definitely be more explicit about what's going on.
966,2019-02-28T18:59:28.170100,Sasha,"Nice, I didn't think of that."
966,2019-02-28T19:04:30.170300,Jennifer,"Thanks a lot, guys. I love this channel!"

967,2019-03-01T04:46:35.177800,Valeri,<@Jamey> Tests don't expect input from the command line. You could create a file containing the test data and read from there.
967,2019-03-01T04:47:33.179200,Valeri,Or you could generally hard code things in the test if there aren't enough variables/data to qualify for creating a different file.

968,2019-03-01T05:09:01.180300,Gearldine,does anyone used unicorn
968,2019-03-01T05:09:24.180800,Gearldine,I am trying preform using gunicorn
968,2019-03-01T05:09:36.181100,Gearldine,with tornado
968,2019-03-01T05:09:47.181400,Gearldine,to consume all cores of cpu
969,2019-03-01T05:23:01.181900,Mica,think there's a config in gunicorn showing the number of workers you can have
969,2019-03-01T05:23:06.182100,Mica,under `workers`

970,2019-03-01T07:11:45.185800,Karoline,there's not really a way to have input happen during a test without it
970,2019-03-01T07:11:52.186000,Jamey,I thought just importing the function would work. The input is outside the function.
970,2019-03-01T07:12:09.186400,Jamey,So the tests should (in theory) just work
970,2019-03-01T07:12:11.186500,Jamey,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
970,2019-03-01T07:12:38.186900,Karoline,is `input` inside another function or global to the module (minor_elder_youth.py)?
970,2019-03-01T07:13:50.187300,Jamey,It is global
970,2019-03-01T07:14:32.187500,Jamey,Here's the module
970,2019-03-01T07:15:32.188900,Jamey,"Initially I'd put the `input` and `datetime.strptime` stuff at the top but I thought that could be why the test is failing, so I tried moving it lower down to see if that would work."
970,2019-03-01T07:16:05.189500,Karoline,"yeah so when you import the module, that input fires"
970,2019-03-01T07:16:06.189800,Jimmy,there might be a way to mock stdin with pytest
970,2019-03-01T07:16:11.190000,Jimmy,with something like `expect`
970,2019-03-01T07:16:17.190300,Jamey,And here's the test module for completeness
970,2019-03-01T07:16:48.191500,Karoline,"you'll want to move the input to something like:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    year = input('blah blah')
```"
970,2019-03-01T07:16:52.191900,Jamey,Hmmm... Is there a way to avoid that? <@Karoline>
970,2019-03-01T07:17:12.192700,Jamey,Oh seen your response. My bad :sweat_smile:
970,2019-03-01T07:17:15.192900,Karoline,that sort of thing - so that way it only executes that code when the module is run as the main entry point of a program
970,2019-03-01T07:17:57.193600,Jamey,Okay cool. Thanks for that. `mock` seemed a bit _much_ for what I'm doing here. Thanks <@Karoline> :taco:
970,2019-03-01T07:18:21.194000,Karoline,"yeah I think changing the structure will improve the layout of things anyway, so it's good to do."
970,2019-03-01T07:30:22.194900,Jamey,How do I get only the year in a datetime object so that I can use it in subtraction?
970,2019-03-01T07:40:40.198700,Hiroko,but also <@Jamey> check the docs for what is available for a datetime object :slightly_smiling_face:

973,2019-03-01T08:22:27.201500,Alvina,using Multiprocessing Pools() - what is the limit to the number of jobs that can run at once? on a 4 core machine I can obviously have less pools than on an 8 core machine?
973,2019-03-01T08:24:11.202600,Alvina,I'm reading a large file (many GBs) and compressing every 50MB into a gzip chunk of like 8MB - I'm wondering if I can set the pools to some crazy number to get things done quicker
974,2019-03-01T09:30:26.209200,Carissa,"hii devs one small question
which beautiful soup version will be used when i do ``` import bs4 ``` if both 4.6.0 and 4.7.1 are installed"
974,2019-03-01T09:31:55.210200,Carmen,"<@Alvina> There is no hard limit to how many processes you can have in a pool, or even how many pools you can have (though you should probably re-evaluate whether you need more than one or two pools at all)."
974,2019-03-01T09:32:38.211100,Carmen,The effective limit is how many processes it takes before context switching between them starts to degrade performance more than the multiprocessing enhances performance.
974,2019-03-01T09:33:07.211700,Carmen,"That's 100% dependent on your workflow and the tasks you're running (CPU bound, IO bound, memory bound, etc.)."
974,2019-03-01T09:33:27.212200,Carmen,A good rule of thumb to start out is number of cores * 4.
974,2019-03-01T09:34:05.212800,Jimmy,<@Carissa> you can't have both installed for the same python environment
974,2019-03-01T09:34:17.213200,Jimmy,so the answer is the one installed for that environment
974,2019-03-01T09:36:36.215600,Alvina,"<@Carmen> okay cool. thanks. yeah - there are clear performance gains up to a certain point as I tweak the number of processes and the size of the files I am compressing, i guess I will just play around and monitor it"
974,2019-03-01T09:37:12.216300,Carissa,no <@Jimmy> i am creating one enviornment where i have downloaded .tar file of beautiful soup and then i call one script which append both versions path in ```sys.path``` and then after i call ``` import bs4 ```
974,2019-03-01T09:38:09.217200,Carissa,my all functionality works fine but i have doubt which version is used
974,2019-03-01T09:38:45.217700,Jimmy,AFAIK it scan the syspath in order
974,2019-03-01T09:38:54.218000,Jimmy,so the first you append to the sys.path
974,2019-03-01T09:39:20.218500,Jimmy,there might be a way to access the bs4 version in code to you are sure

How do I resolve that in my circle ci pipeline? do I explicitly run a `pip uninstall pathlib`? problem with that is the `python setup.py test` does both install and test"
979,2019-03-01T17:52:13.228000,Letty,"Tough to say, if you’re doing `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` or similar, then anything might be pulling in the dependency.

`pipenv` handles this well, you may be able to do (just once, no need to switch) `pipenv -r ./requirements.txt` and then use `pipenv graph --reverse` to see who pulled it in."
979,2019-03-01T17:53:23.228200,Letty,"alternatively, install your requirements.txt one at a time, by hand, and see when `pathlib` is installed by looking for that pahtlib egg directory."

980,2019-03-01T19:53:28.239500,Priscilla,i dont know
980,2019-03-01T19:53:47.239800,Priscilla,im guessing no...

980,2019-03-01T19:55:06.241300,Corey,Is ```character()``` a function or a method? :slightly_smiling_face:
980,2019-03-01T19:55:07.241500,Priscilla,i dont think i understand classes like i thought i did..
980,2019-03-01T19:55:15.241700,Priscilla,oh lol
980,2019-03-01T19:55:43.242100,Cori,"&gt;  I need to apply that output to a variable
I don't think I fully understand this"
980,2019-03-01T19:56:25.243300,Cori,so you provide `character()` w/ `aString`.... does character() do anything to aString?
980,2019-03-01T19:56:51.244100,Cori,does the output of character() need to be used by the other var or ?
980,2019-03-01T19:56:53.244300,Cori,...
980,2019-03-01T19:57:20.245200,Priscilla,"my function `character` generates a random character, i need that generated character to be assigned to a variable within another function"
980,2019-03-01T19:57:24.245400,Cori,does the other var actually use `aString` (same value as was passed to character())?
980,2019-03-01T19:57:35.245700,Priscilla,yes
980,2019-03-01T19:58:48.247700,Cori,"okay,... so character() is something like:

```
character()
  random_character = generateRandomChar()
  return random_character
```
?"
980,2019-03-01T19:59:18.248000,Priscilla,None
980,2019-03-01T20:00:05.249000,Cori,"okay... so instead of `print` (or after it if you need `aString` to output to screen, do `return`"
980,2019-03-01T20:00:25.249600,Priscilla,ah! thats what it was a minute ago lol
980,2019-03-01T20:00:29.249800,Cori,"in second fucntion
`var_name = character()`"
980,2019-03-01T20:01:26.250800,Cori,and remove `self` and `aString` from declaration
980,2019-03-01T20:03:10.251700,Priscilla,"so it gave me an error saying ""method has no argument""  when I removed `self` and `aString`"
980,2019-03-01T20:04:04.252400,Cori,are either of these functions nested?
980,2019-03-01T20:05:50.252600,Priscilla,no
980,2019-03-01T20:09:02.252900,Priscilla,hmmm... can a loop work within a function?

980,2019-03-01T20:11:25.253600,Priscilla,strange... it doesnt give me the error anymore

980,2019-03-01T20:23:31.259500,Priscilla,"i did put them in a class earlier but i dont think i did it right, like should all of the functions be within a class?"
980,2019-03-01T20:24:42.259800,Cori,no
980,2019-03-01T20:25:41.260500,Cori,Sorry <@Sasha> hadn't seen your latest reply. Please.
980,2019-03-01T20:27:17.262000,Sasha,"If the functions are more or less separate, or just call each other, they don't need to be in a class. If, on the other hand, you start having some persistent shared state, like a serial port that remains open between calls, then it might make sense for the class to own that state."
980,2019-03-01T20:27:37.262500,Priscilla,i see
980,2019-03-01T20:27:39.262700,Cori,line 71 calls character() function but how are you calling the rest?
980,2019-03-01T20:27:40.262800,Priscilla,i think..
980,2019-03-01T20:31:23.263400,Priscilla,what do you mean the rest? i dont think there is anything else being called
980,2019-03-01T20:32:25.264500,Priscilla,"wait a minute, i should be calling the `port_traffic` function  at lines 80 and 84..."
980,2019-03-01T20:32:28.264700,Priscilla,i think
980,2019-03-01T20:33:37.265400,Priscilla,"my god, i have written myself into madness lol, my own code is confusing me so much"
980,2019-03-01T20:34:49.266000,Priscilla,no im wrong i shouldt be calling that function at line 80 and 84
980,2019-03-01T20:35:50.266800,Cori,"right. so absolutely nothing in this script calls anything in this script, except for line 71."
980,2019-03-01T20:36:02.267300,Priscilla,i believe you are correct
980,2019-03-01T20:36:06.267400,Cori,What is executing this script? How are you executing this script?
980,2019-03-01T20:36:24.268000,Cori,"back to what atvaccaro suggested earlier, does it need to be a package?"
980,2019-03-01T20:36:34.268300,Cori,or is this supposed to do something on its own?
980,2019-03-01T20:39:01.270500,Priscilla,"it is its own program to test some equipment. send a letter, then receive that same letter back, to verify the device is sending and receiving properly."
980,2019-03-01T20:39:17.270900,Priscilla,does that answer your question?
980,2019-03-01T20:39:31.271400,Priscilla,oh and its all done through serial ports
980,2019-03-01T20:39:34.271500,Cori,"so to run it, you `python scriptName.py`?"
980,2019-03-01T20:39:43.271700,Priscilla,"right now, yes"
980,2019-03-01T20:39:46.271900,Cori,okay.

I'm looking for a way to easy deploy python/php scripts on virtual machines (mostly google cloud), the goal is to run each script with different arguments.

997,2019-03-02T20:06:59.325700,Jonas,That's almost an impossible question to answer without more context 
997,2019-03-02T20:08:13.327200,Jonas,Kubernetes is great for deploying containers. If you want different arguments then just make a new k8s deployment with them 
997,2019-03-02T20:08:31.327900,Jonas,"If they are a short lived ""job"" rather than a service, use a k8s job"

We can also check `isinstance(my_function(SomeModel), SomeModel)` and get `True`

997,2019-03-03T01:53:17.334800,Sasha,"You may want to expand on what you are really wanting to do. There are a number of ways to mix things up... you can assign attributes to functions like `func.foo`, or you can have a class behave like a function by defining the `__call__` method, etc."

998,2019-03-02T21:55:22.329900,Marla,"`'SomeModel'` as a string if you are using &lt; Python 3.7. This is similar to how Django requires strings for ForeignKey references where the model is not yet declared.
If you are on 3.7+, `PEP563` suggests including:
`from __future__ import annotations`
This allows for setting the return value as the model itself instead of a string, as in `SomeModel`."

If the microservice codebases are separate, I don't think there's any way for you to use canvas to declare the task dependencies. You'd have to setup something where a task makes a call to the next microservice in its dependency chain, so that that service can initiate the next task."

1004,2019-03-03T20:59:03.353100,Carmen,"It very much depends on the code in question. In that specific case, no, leaving out the else won't harm the logic of the function, and it doesn't even harm the readability of the function very much."

1005,2019-03-03T17:33:15.350100,Sasha,You could also have a wrapper class which overrides equality for its objects but still use a regular set. Note that in both cases you may need to also override the hash calculation.
1005,2019-03-03T22:28:33.354300,Sasha,"I'd tend to disagree in this case, since omitting the `else` would make it return `None` instead of `False`, which is not quite the same thing."
1005,2019-03-03T22:34:12.355300,Carmen,"Ah, now I was thinking only about the else itself, not removing the code within the else branch. Effectively, shift the `return False` to always run as the last line of the function."

How can I relativly import this util ?

if you want use relative import as you wrote `from scripts.utils.csv_utils import CsvUtils` you need to run script outside `scripts` folder."
1008,2019-03-04T03:32:19.370400,Remedios,if you will run locust/script like `python -m scripts.tests.kafka` then you will be able to import like you want

```

Out[92]: 12
```

```

Out[93]: 12.0
```
etc
`bool` and `datetype`
Is there a library for this?
Or only I can like:

1018,2019-03-04T11:20:51.411000,Mica,i currently have the following for an Elasticsearch query class and two files worth of queries. I want to be able to have the queries being part of the instantiated class if possible without moving all of the query functions into the class itself? Is there a way to do this with some kind of inheritance? Let me know if anything is unclear thanks!
1018,2019-03-04T11:21:13.411600,Mica,the two files are queries specific to independent ES indexes
1018,2019-03-04T11:23:47.412000,Lillia,I'm confused by ```I want to be able to have the queries being part of the instantiated class if possible without moving all of the query functions into the class itself?``` do these query functions already exist?
1018,2019-03-04T11:24:04.412300,Lillia,Or is `first_query()` an example of one?
1018,2019-03-04T11:26:28.414900,Mica,"just an example and they do exist. I have one file that has the class defined with all the key components such as IP and port, and I've recently added the ability to parse indexes and doc_type to the class. I have to files containing queries for the ES using this Model, originally each query instantiated a new class instance and used that for the query. I was wondering if it would be possible to get around that by making the queries a part of the class without copy pasting them into the actual class code and making it some several hundred line file"
1018,2019-03-04T11:27:12.415700,Mica,"so:
```
class Foo:
  ...

def query():
  Foo().query()
```
is what i had"
1018,2019-03-04T11:27:24.416000,Mica,"but I don't think it's right, though I could be wrong"
1018,2019-03-04T11:29:01.417500,Clemmie,"I would say don’t compromise clarity and readability for some amorphous idea that the file is “too long” if the queries are cognitively tied to the class, then make them part of it"
1018,2019-03-04T11:29:03.417600,Lillia,"If all these queries rely on the same data (in this case, IP/port, indices, doc_types) then moving them into the class is probably the best option"
1018,2019-03-04T11:29:54.419100,Mica,":thumbsup: cheers guys, at least i think I'm moving it in the right direction (i think) haha"
1018,2019-03-04T11:30:00.419500,Mica,too much second guessing
1018,2019-03-04T11:30:24.420200,Clemmie,"If they are not, then you probably want something where the class sets up the connections and workflow, and then fires a query. You could have a method
```
class Foo:
   def run(query_function):
        query_function()
```"
1018,2019-03-04T11:30:41.420800,Lillia,^ was going to be my second suggestion
1018,2019-03-04T11:30:55.421400,Clemmie,"and call it with
```
def a():
    do_a_query_here....

```"
1018,2019-03-04T11:32:08.423200,Lillia,"FWIW you can also go the other way around, where you pass the `Foo` object into the query function. Think of how you pass a database engine/connection to some frameworks."

1018,2019-03-04T11:33:21.424700,Mica,"ye, so like a decorator?"
1018,2019-03-04T11:33:31.425100,Clemmie,^great suggestion if you have queries that can be run by different backends
1018,2019-03-04T11:34:02.425500,Clemmie,"Not a decorator, because you want it to be dynamic"
1018,2019-03-04T11:34:17.425900,Clemmie,you have an abstract class SearchClass
1018,2019-03-04T11:34:27.426200,Clemmie,that defines an abstract method `run`
1018,2019-03-04T11:34:58.426900,Clemmie,you implement `run` for however individual backends run their query type
1018,2019-03-04T11:36:48.429000,Clemmie,"then your queries take a `klass` parameter and do this
```
def query1(klass):
   klass.run(query1_specifics....)
```
You can even type hint that the `klass` needs to implement `SearchClass`, or just handle the attribute and notimplemented errors"

<@Lillia> I thought that it could be used to validate the data for the attribute when set internally by my class. Would such a validation be unnecessary if the attribute is set internally by the class?"
1021,2019-03-04T14:35:36.470700,Lillia,Can't you do the validation in the method that's setting the new value?
1021,2019-03-04T14:35:54.471100,Lillia,"Getters/setters make the life of the caller easier, that's really it."
1021,2019-03-04T14:36:07.471500,Lillia,Makes for less typing.
1021,2019-03-04T14:36:26.471800,Lillia,I wouldn't add unnecessary boilerplate if you're already setting the value yourself.
1021,2019-03-04T14:36:52.472500,Lillia,"(I'll add a caveat, a setter _may_ be good if you use this validation in many places)"
1021,2019-03-04T14:40:01.476000,Lillia,Actually I take that back; using a setter for validation is a bit weird.
1021,2019-03-04T14:40:32.477100,Clemmie,"Validation on attribute change is a hard one. The client can still access the underlying attribute without calling the setter. It is kind of like front-end back-end validation. Good to do on the frontend for speed/clarity, but if you don’t check on the backend also you will compromised"
1021,2019-03-04T14:40:53.477900,Clemmie,"So, by all means validate on change, but you should also when the value is _used_"
1021,2019-03-04T14:41:49.479000,Lillia,I would have `withdraw()` do the check. Adding a setter simply for validation is unneeded boilerplate. It doesn't make the life of the caller any easier.

1021,2019-03-04T14:44:53.484500,Lillia,"Your setter can do the same validation that `setBalance` would have done, but it makes the syntax cleaner for the caller. Does that make sense?"
1021,2019-03-04T14:45:16.485100,Lillia,"You aren't expecting the caller to directly set the balance, correct?"
1021,2019-03-04T14:45:49.485300,Clemmie,linux or windows?
1021,2019-03-04T14:45:55.485700,Ludie,macOS :smile:
1021,2019-03-04T14:46:04.486000,Clemmie,"ok, great, you have a terminal"
1021,2019-03-04T14:46:29.486700,Ludie,"yes, i know python basics and for loops"
1021,2019-03-04T14:46:33.487000,Ludie,but not enough about json specifically
1021,2019-03-04T14:46:33.487100,Clemmie,"what is the value you need to change, and is it part of a string that is unique in each file?"
1021,2019-03-04T14:46:34.487400,Dominga,"That makes sense.

That is correct. The caller would invoke the `withdraw` method of the account object, which would set the balance internally."
1021,2019-03-04T14:46:54.488100,Lillia,Right; you already have methods that the caller will use. Those methods can do the validation just fine.
1021,2019-03-04T14:46:58.488400,Dominga,"Ahhh, so if my Atm class would set the balance directly, then it would make sense to create a setter?"
1021,2019-03-04T14:47:02.488600,Lillia,Correct!
1021,2019-03-04T14:47:05.488800,Ludie,"Sample file:
```{
  ""version"": ""1.0"",
  ""identifier"": ""2854-1269-8-1"",
  ""title"": ""Welcome To The World Of More"",
  ""language"": ""en""
}```"
1021,2019-03-04T14:47:10.489100,Clemmie,And do you need to maintain the directory strucutre
1021,2019-03-04T14:47:13.489400,Dominga,Thank you very much.
1021,2019-03-04T14:47:14.489500,Ludie,i need to change the language value to `fr`
1021,2019-03-04T14:47:26.489800,Ludie,"Yes, i need to keep that structure"
1021,2019-03-04T14:47:34.490000,Clemmie,"ok, give me a couple of minutes"
1021,2019-03-04T14:47:44.490200,Ludie,Thanks!!
1021,2019-03-04T14:47:46.490500,Ludie,saving my ass
1021,2019-03-04T14:48:20.491100,Dominga,<@Lillia> and <@Clemmie> thanks for your time and the explanations. I appreciate it.
1021,2019-03-04T14:48:34.491300,Lillia,Welcome!
1021,2019-03-04T14:48:46.491500,Lillia,Good questions
1021,2019-03-04T14:49:45.491700,Sasha,"Heh heh, this is like a coding challenge competition."
1021,2019-03-04T14:50:53.491900,Clemmie,"is there a single file in each directory, and nothing else?"
1021,2019-03-04T14:50:57.492100,Ludie,yes
1021,2019-03-04T14:51:18.492300,Clemmie,"ok, first, make a whole copy of your directory structure in case we screw up"
1021,2019-03-04T14:51:23.492500,Ludie,"`/dir/file1.json`
`/dir/file2.json`
`/dir/file3.json`"
1021,2019-03-04T14:51:30.492700,Ludie,ok
1021,2019-03-04T14:52:24.493000,Ludie,wait
1021,2019-03-04T14:52:32.493200,Ludie,"the directory structure above is innacurate, one second"
1021,2019-03-04T14:52:32.493300,Clemmie,"then in a terminal that is at the root of the directory structure you will want to run `sed -i 's/""language"": ""en""/""language"": ""fr""/g"" */*.json`"
1021,2019-03-04T14:52:39.493600,Lillia,`sed` !
1021,2019-03-04T14:52:52.493900,Ludie,"`/dir/a1/file.json`
`/dir/a2/file.json`
`/dir/a3/file.json`"
1021,2019-03-04T14:53:07.494200,Clemmie,"that says “use the stream editor in place to replace string 1 with sdtring 2, globally in each file"
1021,2019-03-04T14:53:34.494400,Ludie,"ok, so first i cd to my test directory"
1021,2019-03-04T14:53:43.494600,Clemmie,yup
1021,2019-03-04T14:53:59.494800,Sasha,Watch out for the quote after `/g`.
1021,2019-03-04T14:54:19.495000,Clemmie,"yup, my bad - should be a single `'`"
1021,2019-03-04T14:54:20.495200,Ludie,its not meant to be there?
1021,2019-03-04T14:54:25.495400,Ludie,oki
1021,2019-03-04T14:54:36.495600,Clemmie,"`sed -i 's/""language"": ""en""/""language"": ""fr""/g' */*.json`"
1021,2019-03-04T14:54:38.495800,Ludie,"`sed -i 's/""language"": ""en""/""language"": ""fr""/g' */*.json`"
1021,2019-03-04T14:54:45.496000,Clemmie,this is why we copied first
1021,2019-03-04T14:55:05.496200,Ludie,"`sed: 1: ""1/article.json"": invalid command code /`"
1021,2019-03-04T14:55:07.496400,Clemmie,hopefully yes. we may need to do some string escaping to make it work for sure
1021,2019-03-04T14:55:13.496600,Ludie,I think this is connected to my directory structure
1021,2019-03-04T14:55:16.496800,Ludie,the error
1021,2019-03-04T14:55:28.497000,Clemmie,nope on os x I forgot -e
1021,2019-03-04T14:55:46.497200,Clemmie,"`sed -i -e 's/""language"": ""en""/""language"": ""fr""/g' */*.json`"
1021,2019-03-04T14:55:57.497400,Ludie,"ok, it ran"
1021,2019-03-04T14:56:00.497600,Ludie,let me check the output :smile:
1021,2019-03-04T14:56:07.497800,Clemmie,"or maybe not, one second"
1021,2019-03-04T14:56:25.498000,Ludie,it worked!!
1021,2019-03-04T14:56:27.498200,Ludie,but
1021,2019-03-04T14:56:48.498400,Ludie,"it created a duplicate file too, with `file.json-e`"
1021,2019-03-04T14:57:07.498600,Clemmie,I thought it might
1021,2019-03-04T14:57:14.498800,Clemmie,does the txt look correct in those?
1021,2019-03-04T14:57:34.499000,Ludie,no
1021,2019-03-04T14:57:40.499200,Ludie,the -e files seem to have the old data
1021,2019-03-04T14:57:49.499400,Ludie,"and the files with the proper name, have the proper data"
1021,2019-03-04T14:58:07.499600,Ludie,is there a way to not generate the second file?
1021,2019-03-04T14:58:21.499800,Clemmie,"ok, different try"
1021,2019-03-04T14:58:34.500000,Clemmie,"I think yes, try this"
1021,2019-03-04T14:59:08.500200,Clemmie,"`sed -i'' 's/""language"": ""en""/""language"": ""fr""/g' */*.json`"
1021,2019-03-04T14:59:19.500400,Ludie,ok

1021,2019-03-04T14:59:43.500800,Clemmie,we’ll get it
1021,2019-03-04T14:59:48.501000,Clemmie,how much time do you have?
1021,2019-03-04T14:59:56.501200,Ludie,"15mn before i get in trouble, more or less"
1021,2019-03-04T14:59:58.501400,Sasha,May be easier to just mass-delete the `-e` files?
1021,2019-03-04T14:59:59.501600,Clemmie,ok
1021,2019-03-04T15:01:52.501900,Ludie,going to the bathroom for 1mn
1021,2019-03-04T15:02:46.502800,Alvina,<@Lillia> <@Jettie> that worked thanks a bunch. just didn't expect the format to be in bytes so I will try with mode='rt'
1021,2019-03-04T15:04:33.503000,Ludie,Am back!
1021,2019-03-04T15:06:35.503200,Clemmie,working on it
1021,2019-03-04T15:07:55.503400,Clemmie,"`find ~/tmp/a -type f  -exec sed -i '' 's/""language"": ""en""/""language"": ""fr""/g' {} \;` make sure to replace `/tmp/a` with the path to your current directory"
1021,2019-03-04T15:09:34.504000,Ludie,wait
1021,2019-03-04T15:09:43.504200,Ludie,"your command worked , i think you missed a space"
1021,2019-03-04T15:09:49.504400,Ludie,after -i
1021,2019-03-04T15:09:55.504600,Ludie,"i just tried it, am checking now"
1021,2019-03-04T15:10:11.504800,Ludie,yes!!
1021,2019-03-04T15:10:14.505000,Clemmie,I did - did that work without the find command? I added it back in with the latest command
1021,2019-03-04T15:10:19.505200,Clemmie,people were unclear on the interwebs
1021,2019-03-04T15:10:26.505600,Ludie,"doesnt work: `sed -i'' 's/""language"": ""en""/""language"": ""fr""/g' */*.json`"

1021,2019-03-04T15:10:50.506000,Ludie,that is perfect !!!!
1021,2019-03-04T15:10:51.506200,Ludie,woof
1021,2019-03-04T15:10:56.506400,Ludie,"ok, let me send the email"
1021,2019-03-04T15:10:57.506600,Clemmie,"Go forth, and continue to have a job :wink:"
1021,2019-03-04T15:11:18.506800,Ludie,sent :smile:
1021,2019-03-04T15:11:21.507000,Ludie,can’t thank you enough
1021,2019-03-04T15:12:05.507200,Ludie,Can i ask another question related to that? that may help very much in the future as i am going to take more in with json files
1021,2019-03-04T15:12:13.507400,Clemmie,"for the future, you want to add the unix toolkit to your toolkit - `sed` `awk` `cut` `uniq` and `sort` in particular can get you through a whole host of text manipulation problems that we tend to think in much more python for"
1021,2019-03-04T15:12:17.507600,Clemmie,sure
1021,2019-03-04T15:13:24.507900,Ludie,"Say if I wanted to changed a full json object, instead of just a value, like this:
```{
  ""version"": ""1.0"",
  ""identifier"": ""2854-1269-8-1"",
  ""title"": ""Welcome To The World Of More"",
      {
      ""language"": ""en"",
      ""country"": ""uk"" 
      }
}```"
1021,2019-03-04T15:13:33.508100,Ludie,pardon the indentation
1021,2019-03-04T15:13:58.508300,Ludie,"If I were to try and change ```      {
      ""language"": ""en"",
      ""country"": ""uk"" 
      }``` only, would i just specify the text without the line breaks?"
1021,2019-03-04T15:14:27.508500,Ludie,"Like this: `{""language"": ""en"",""country"": ""uk""}`"
1021,2019-03-04T15:14:36.508700,Clemmie,"you would need to do the line breaks, given what I showed you, if the line breaks are in the text"
1021,2019-03-04T15:14:42.508900,Clemmie,but! there are other ways
1021,2019-03-04T15:14:57.509100,Ludie,i am scared about pasting line breaks into the terminal
1021,2019-03-04T15:15:04.509300,Ludie,usually doesnt work out the way i want it to
1021,2019-03-04T15:15:24.509500,Clemmie,"you could use a json processor (there are a bunch, you can take a look for them) to flatten the file, then changeout the text, then use the processor to re-save them pretty printed"
1021,2019-03-04T15:16:01.509700,Clemmie,"also the char `\n` is the newline indicator (usually) so you would do `{""language"": ""en"",\n""country"": ""uk""}`"
1021,2019-03-04T15:16:12.509900,Clemmie,and also put the `\n` in the replaced text and you would be ok
1021,2019-03-04T15:16:20.510100,Ludie,nice!
1021,2019-03-04T15:16:22.510300,Clemmie,that is if you wanted to deal with the file as is
1021,2019-03-04T15:16:45.510500,Clemmie,"just always make sure to make a backup copy before messing with it, and you will be fine"
1021,2019-03-04T15:17:31.510700,Clemmie,in `sed` you might need to escape control characters (link \n) but you can figure that out quickly enough
1021,2019-03-04T15:17:32.510900,Ludie,noted
1021,2019-03-04T15:17:54.511200,Ludie,"yes, i am a little familiar with escaping characters"
1021,2019-03-04T15:18:27.512100,Alvina,is there a lot of overhead opening a file as gzip as text compared to a normal file?
1021,2019-03-04T15:18:29.512300,Ludie,s/ /g is to ground the changes ? and the start and end versions are always separated by a slash?
1021,2019-03-04T15:18:42.512700,Alvina,I am pretty much immediately writing chunks of it back to gzip to send elsewhere
1021,2019-03-04T15:19:30.512900,Clemmie,"so `s` = substitute, `/a/b/` = b for a, `g`=globally"
1021,2019-03-04T15:19:48.513100,Clemmie,if you leave out the g it will only replace the first occurrence in the file
1021,2019-03-04T15:19:50.513300,Ludie,Ok
1021,2019-03-04T15:20:02.513500,Ludie,"i will read more about this command, very powerful!!"
1021,2019-03-04T15:20:04.513700,Ludie,thanks again
1021,2019-03-04T15:20:11.513900,Clemmie,"you can change the slash delimiter, but I don’t recall the syntax"
1021,2019-03-04T15:20:31.514100,Clemmie,no problem. This is fun stuff to me
1021,2019-03-04T15:21:01.514300,Ludie,have a great day
1021,2019-03-04T15:21:07.514500,Clemmie,you too
1021,2019-03-04T15:22:50.515000,Lillia,Likely not enough to matter.
1021,2019-03-04T15:23:20.515600,Lillia,You said 4.6GB
1021,2019-03-04T15:23:26.515800,Lillia,Is that zipped or unzipped?
1021,2019-03-04T15:23:42.516100,Alvina,unzipped.
1021,2019-03-04T15:23:56.516600,Alvina,so I was copying to gzip instead to be kind to the network
1021,2019-03-04T15:24:02.516800,Alvina,and then opening the gzip file
1021,2019-03-04T15:24:26.517000,Alvina,"Mar 5, 2019	Scheduled update	4:16 am SGT	5m 6s	3,959,765	 Data updated successfully	 
Mar 4, 2019	Scheduled update	6:45 pm SGT	3m 16s	3,916,909	 Data updated successfully"
1021,2019-03-04T15:24:43.517400,Alvina,yeah I saw about a 2 minute difference almost where the gzip version was slower - but it could be a fluke
1021,2019-03-04T15:24:48.517600,Alvina,will have to keep an eye on it
1021,2019-03-04T15:24:57.517900,Lillia,Hmm interesting
1021,2019-03-04T15:25:06.518400,Alvina,the file is 260ish MB compressed
1021,2019-03-04T15:25:11.518600,Lillia,I would guess that the network would be the bottleneck
1021,2019-03-04T15:25:20.519200,Alvina,so the overall time should be way lower (copy from remote server to local server)
1021,2019-03-04T15:25:23.519400,Lillia,Without any actual knowledge of the situation :smile:
1021,2019-03-04T15:25:35.519800,Alvina,just the process with opening and uploading data might be slower.. will have to check
1021,2019-03-04T15:25:57.520300,Lillia,You could write a simpler tester.
1021,2019-03-04T15:26:24.520700,Lillia,I'd think the 20x smaller network call would be more than worth the cost of unzipping.
1021,2019-03-04T15:27:42.520800,Alvina,None
1021,2019-03-04T15:28:05.521700,Bethany,is this a table stored as csv?
1021,2019-03-04T15:28:08.522000,Alvina,yes
1021,2019-03-04T15:28:32.522600,Alvina,"no, just a plain csv file"
1021,2019-03-04T15:28:43.523100,Alvina,the results of a copy query from postgres
1021,2019-03-04T15:28:47.523300,Alvina,either remote or local
1021,2019-03-04T15:29:08.523600,Alvina,the API I am using only accepts csv:
1021,2019-03-04T15:29:12.523800,Alvina,"To upload data in CSV format, the Domo specification used for representing data grids in CSV format closely follows the RFC standard for CSV (RFC-4180). For more details on correct CSV formatting, click here."
1021,2019-03-04T15:29:28.524000,Bethany,:disappointed:
1021,2019-03-04T15:29:34.524200,Alvina,yeah
1021,2019-03-04T15:30:18.525000,Alvina,"I can send chunks of data to the API in parallel though, so I read from a huge csv and yield a chunk (50MBish seems to be fastest)"

1022,2019-03-04T14:26:28.466100,Dominga,"Hi,

I’ve been having some issues with class attributes and properties (python 3). I know how getters and setters are generally used and that it’s the pythonic way to use the `@property` to achieve define getters and setters when they are required.

Any feedback is appreciated. Sorry for the longish quesiton.

Now my question is twofold:

Part 1
How and why should I define the attribute:
```
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        # or instead 
        self._name = name
        # which is preferred and why?

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name
```

Part 2
With the `@property` decorator, I can add some logic to setting an attribute after the fact. So if it has been publicly set like: `instance.attribute = some_value`, I can use a property to route this through a setter and check the if, for example, `some_value` is in a specific range.

This makes sense to me. However, what if want to use a setter as defined above, but indicate to the user that it is not part of the public API of the class?

For example, if I don’t want client code to use a specific attribute, I’d write `self._attribute`. How would I do this with property decorator?"
1022,2019-03-04T14:41:01.478200,Dominga,"Hm, I thought it is more readable and contained in that class.

I have an instance of an Account class, modeling a bank account. For that bank account, I have a balance attribute and a corresponding setter, that checks if it ever drops below 0. If it does, it raises a ValueError.

I also have an Atm class which uses the account object and calls `account.withdraw(amount)` or `account.deposit(amount)`.

To me it seemed useful to have that ‘data integrity’ check inside the setter of the balance."
1022,2019-03-04T14:43:25.481600,Dominga,So what is a setter for if not for validation of the to be set value?

I personally try to find case studies (sometimes directly within AWS learning center/docs) and go over those. They describe real-world scenarios and their solutions.

As for your Lambda question, I'd imagine (without knowing what MS chat room is), that there is an endpoint (much like on slack) that you can just send the notification to. Question is -- can you do it (assuming the Lambda is in Python) asynchronously, without blocking the rest of it? Is it even important (since the notification is possibly the last thing the Lambda does)?

If the answer is yes, I'd find MS chat root endpoint you can send your notification to (much like Slack's webhooks) and not bother with an intermediary like SNS."

Coming back to Python after a long hiatus, I have a couple of questions in the realm of application dependency management. It seems that it is still a mess, what with the venv, wrapper, poetry and pipenv controversy and so on...

*Questions*

1. (more general one) why, in every single folder structure recommendation, there is a redundancy in folder names? like, if I have a `my-module` module, the ""main"" code folder would be `my-module/my-module` as opposed to `my-module/lib` or `my-module/src` or some other similar, more abstract naming convention?
2. is there any sort of consensus, aside from `pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt` on how to separate dev. dependencies from production ones and the proper way to manage them *without going into poetry/pipenv and such*?"

I have a class with about 15 mandatory data fields. I want the caller to instantiate an object from this class, using a classmethod, which reads and parses an excel file (e.g., `instance.from_excel(filepath)`).

I don’t want the user to construct it like `obj = MyClass(15_different_args)`, since that would be quite tedious and the data can only be extracted from an excel file anyways. Would I just set the data fields to `None`, some default value, or don’t set them at all in the  `__init__` ?

Maybe I am just thinking about this wrong.

Example:

```
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, arg_1, arg_2=0, ...):
        self.arg_1 = arg_1
        # or use
        self.arg_2 = arg_2
        # or use
        self.arg_3 = None

1043,2019-03-05T13:07:28.637200,Rosamaria,"Quoting from a great article on Event Collaboration Architecture by Martin Flowler:
&gt;""Event cascades are good because something happens and as a result of a string of local logical event connections something indirect happens. Event cascades are bad because something happens and as a result of a string of local logical event connections something indirect happens. Event cascades usually look pretty obvious when they are described like this, but until you see them they can be very hard to spot. This is an area where *visualization systems* that can build a graph of event chains by querying meta-data from the systems themselves could be very handy.""


Another one:
&gt;""With Event Collaboration you don't know who is listening to the events until run-time - which in practice means you can only find the links between the components in configuration data - and there may be multiple areas of configuration data. As a result these interactions are hard to find, understand and debug. It is very helpful here to use *automated tools* that can display the configuration of components at run time so you can see what you have.""


What are some such *visualization systems* and *automated tools* in the ecosystem today?"

1043,2019-03-05T13:22:51.642500,Jettie,I don't think having a generalized solution is even possible
1043,2019-03-05T13:26:43.646300,Rosamaria,absolutely true. lets see what we can afford to de-generalize to make it possible. maybe i have to follow a particular schema of events. maybe i have to use a complimentary client library with an event broker. i will still have immense flexibility to to make all sorts of applications with that.
1044,2019-03-05T13:51:04.651200,Dominga,"Question:

I have a `class Account` and `class InsufficientFundsError(Exception)`. Both reside in the module `account.py`.

An instance of `Account` raises a `InsufficientFundsError` within a member method if a particular condition is met.

In my main module, I am importing: `from account import Account`. My code in the main method calls a method with an argument that raises the `InsufficientFundsError`.

And it works. Now my question: Why does it? I thought I would have to import the custom exception as well, but it works without it, too."
1044,2019-03-05T13:57:19.654300,Clemmie,"<@Dominga> Is the code path that triggers the `InssufficientFundsError` getting run/tested? Python won’t normally cause an error until it is encountered at runtime, at which point you will get a `NameError`. Another possibility is that you have the code path wrapped in a greedy except (such as `except: ...` or `except Exception: ...`)"
1044,2019-03-05T14:24:04.658400,Dominga,"<@Clemmie> Thanks for the reply, and sorry for my late response.

It is being run and works as expected. I am using:
```
try: 
    # something
except InsufficientFundsError:
    # something
```

The error is raised by the account class in the account module and not within my code of the main module. Maybe that’s why? I am not importing the entire module, but just the class though. Which is why I am confused."
1044,2019-03-05T14:26:05.660000,Clemmie,"So the snippet above is in your main module? Have you tested it to so that the error is actually raised by the account? If not then that `except` is not reached at runtime, and the `NameError` will not occur"
1044,2019-03-05T14:26:46.660700,Clemmie,"put another way, run some code that will make `Account` raise that error in the main module, and then see if it still works"
1044,2019-03-05T14:35:55.666500,Dominga,"I’ve expressed myself unclear. Let me rephrase:

The exception is encountered at runtime and handled properly. The handler is in the account class. The main module just calls a void method of the account class. If as a result of this method, the account’s attribute would be set below 0, the InsufficientFundsError is raised within the account class, by the account class.

```
class Account(...)

1044,2019-03-05T14:38:39.668900,Ashley,"so you're saying the instance of the class raised the exception inside itself, and then caught it inside itself"
1044,2019-03-05T14:39:16.669600,Clemmie,"So the class `InsufficientFundsError` itself never shows up in the main module, correct? That means the python import stack is working correctly. You only have to import classes that you explicitly use, in this case you are importing `Account`, which correctly (itself) handles the import/reference to `InsufficientFundsError`"
1045,2019-03-05T15:07:19.670200,Earleen,Are there any good open source python frameworks that I can ease myself into?
1045,2019-03-05T15:08:02.670700,Earleen,Maybe smaller libraries

1046,2019-03-05T15:26:33.675400,Almeda,"Hey everyone, is there a way to get pip to send a flag to a module's setup.py?"
1046,2019-03-05T15:29:18.676200,Hildegard,"I have a similar issue where I'd like to install some, but not all, dependencies in develop mode. Is there an easy way to do it within setuptools or pip?"
1046,2019-03-05T15:30:44.677100,Almeda,Are you using something like pip install -r requirements.txt to build out the environment?
1046,2019-03-05T15:31:41.677800,Hildegard,"right now I am, but I'd like to move the dependencies into setup.py for a proper package"
1046,2019-03-05T15:35:17.680900,Almeda,"For the requirements-driven method, you can reference another requirements file by putting the -r &lt;some other file&gt; right in the .txt file, and split them out into ""full"" and ""development"" requirements. More on that at <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36744143/how-can-i-define-multiple-requirement-files>  I'm less sure about doing it through setup.py."
1046,2019-03-05T15:35:18.681100,Hildegard,"Brett Cannon does some trickery with the dependencies in setup.py here <https://snarky.ca/clarifying-pep-518/> , and I thought I could somehow extend this idea. Have a list of the ""internal"" packages that I might need to hack on and install them in develop mode."
1046,2019-03-05T15:38:04.682000,Almeda,"If you don't mind me asking, what's the use case? Usually you're trying to go the other way around, where your dev environment has more packages than you want distributed."
1046,2019-03-05T16:04:17.682600,Hildegard,team harmony :wink:
1046,2019-03-05T16:06:58.685100,Hildegard,"The idea is that we have a variety of internal packages that serve as libraries for a project. Sometimes a dev wants to be able to fiddle with one of the underlying libraries, as you would in develop mode."
1046,2019-03-05T16:11:18.688200,Hildegard,"the team harmony part is finding a single way of defining the dependencies that serves 1) the guy who doesn't care about the supporting libs, wants to treat them like blessed versions and is ok waiting 15 mins to pull in a new build, and 2) the gal who manually fiddles with PYTHONPATH for ""control"" because they need may need to work on all 15 libraries"
1046,2019-03-05T16:13:32.690200,Hildegard,"doing `-e` in requirements.txt files gets close, but I think it would be ideal to specify things in `setup.py` and have a flag for dev power install for user 2 vs package install for user 1"
1046,2019-03-05T16:23:40.690500,Ashley,"interesting writeup, although selenium is more of a test automation tool, as it's meant to emulate user interaction. It's not a very good scraping tool."
1046,2019-03-05T16:24:46.691100,Ashley,<@Hildegard> Why not just host a private PyPI server?
1046,2019-03-05T16:25:43.691300,Ashley,"oh sorry, misread"
1046,2019-03-05T16:25:45.691500,Ashley,nevermind
1046,2019-03-05T16:26:52.692000,Ashley,"but if you want to go that route, you should probably split things into separate pacakges"
1046,2019-03-05T16:27:01.692300,Ashley,each with their own dependencies
1046,2019-03-05T16:33:28.695300,Almeda,"I see that the Pillow project (only picking on them because I'm neck-deep in their source anyway) uses setup.py for its distribution, but a separate requirements.txt for its development, and its requirements.txt uses -e flags for local modules."

1046,2019-03-05T16:34:25.696200,Almeda,So your power user would just have to run pip install on the requirements file
1046,2019-03-05T16:43:56.697900,Lillia,Yes! Generally it's only a good idea if know it will be relatively small.
1046,2019-03-05T16:44:23.698100,Lillia,Otherwise you risk really using a lot of CPU and memory just to get a `len` call.
1046,2019-03-05T16:47:43.698700,Almeda,You're making a direct reference to the subnets method. Try .subnets() or putting the @property decorator just above def subnets.
1046,2019-03-05T16:47:58.698900,Carlota,gotcha!
1047,2019-03-05T16:13:01.689000,Rosemarie,Just looked at a neat walkthrough here: <https://realpython.com/modern-web-automation-with-python-and-selenium/>
1048,2019-03-05T16:39:05.697500,Lanny,is it common to convert result of `map` `filter` to list in order to call `len` on it?
1048,2019-03-05T16:46:01.698300,Carlota,"So the below class, when doing something like this:
```
revl_vpc = RELV_VPC(t, cluster_name, params)
print(type(revl_vpc.subnets))
print(type(revl_vpc.private_subnets))
print(type(revl_vpc.public_subnets))
print(type(revl_vpc.private_subnets + revl_vpc.public_subnets))
```
why is it that for the `revl_vpc.subnets` it prints a `class 'method'` while the others print `list` (which is what I want)."

1050,2019-03-05T18:33:54.712400,Hildegard,or put the space in the lookbehind and wrap the keyword options in a non-capturing group `(?: ... )`.

1050,2019-03-05T18:39:46.713800,Shirley,"and it is hard to account for the table pattern as it can be a varying mix of `db.shcema.table`, `shcema.table`, `#table`, etc."
1050,2019-03-05T18:56:26.716000,Hildegard,"ah right, <@Shirley>, so capture the table name in a capture group `(&lt;tablename_regex&gt;)`. depending on how full strength you want this to be, you might end up needing a real parser. i give up on regexes if the syntax is detailed and i need something really robust."
1050,2019-03-05T18:58:47.716400,Shirley,"yeah, I might leave it as is and just `.strip()` it after words"

1053,2019-03-05T19:45:16.717600,Clayton,Still not sure the difference between 'docstrings' and 'comments'  ?
1053,2019-03-05T19:47:21.717800,Carlota,"Keep getting the following error: `TypeError: can only concatenate str (not ""ImportValue"") to str`.  Not sure how I can insert the `eks_cluster_name`."
1053,2019-03-05T19:52:40.720800,Sasha,"<@Clayton> A docstring is a Python literal quoted string in a specific position, like the start of a function, which is available to the software at runtime for help commands, etc. A comment, using `#`, can be sprinkled anywhere in the code, but it's invisible except to a human reading those lines. So the former is usually used for documentation, and the latter for notes to developers maintaining the app."
1053,2019-03-05T19:53:07.721100,Clayton,is it like logging ?
1053,2019-03-05T19:55:05.722000,Sasha,"No, it's just fixed text, embedded in the program. Logging would be dynamic output."
1053,2019-03-05T19:55:45.722600,Clayton,isnt the stack trace enough for troubleshooting errors ?
1053,2019-03-05T19:59:20.724900,Sasha,"Well, that will tell you where an error was encountered, but not what the code was doing or why. Compare `x += (len(data) + 9) // 10` with `x += (len(data) + 9) // 10  # Split rows into batches of 10, rounded up`."
1053,2019-03-05T20:00:12.725300,Clayton,like a debugger output ?
1053,2019-03-05T20:01:00.726200,Sasha,"No, it's just a note from the programmer explaining what they were thinking, etc. or clarifying something which works but might be confusing to understand how it works."
1053,2019-03-05T20:01:49.727000,Clayton,"comment = what the code does , docstring = why it it does what it does"
1053,2019-03-05T20:08:49.728500,Sasha,"It's more like docstring = what this function does, why you might want to call it, and what the parameters mean. Comment = how the function was implemented, in case you need to change how it works."
1053,2019-03-05T20:18:32.729800,Clayton,Ive been reading about it and i still dont see anything that really elevates it above comments
1053,2019-03-05T20:24:58.730800,Sasha,"The main difference is that it's accessible at runtime through `__doc__`, and is a standard place to look for documentation."
1053,2019-03-05T20:34:33.732000,Clayton,"i saw that, you access it through the ipyhon / interactive prompt.  why not just look at the script to see the docstrings.  just dont get really get it"

1053,2019-03-05T20:54:11.736600,Bethany,The access to docstrings also makes it so ide can easily show you docs of functions you're calling. The fact that it's part of the language means the tooling can all work with it. The comments are not as easily accessible programmatically
1053,2019-03-05T20:55:05.737300,Bethany,Other languages don't all have a standard like this. It's big QoL improvement
1054,2019-03-05T20:39:10.733400,Hiroko,Consider documentation builders like Sphinx
1054,2019-03-05T20:41:30.733700,Hiroko,"&gt;&gt;&gt; Docstrings versus Block comments
These aren’t interchangeable. For a function or class, the leading comment block is a programmer’s note. The docstring describes the operation of the function or class"
1055,2019-03-05T21:16:31.738000,Clayton,I think I don't know how to leverage the value of 'docstrings'
1055,2019-03-05T21:26:34.738700,Clayton,Is it like the 'man' or 'cat' command in Unix ?
1055,2019-03-05T23:39:54.741600,Candra,More like man than cat
1055,2019-03-05T23:39:58.741800,Stan,"<@Clayton> -- it's not like 'man' or 'cat'. Docstrings are a way of associating a help string with a class of function for example. It is possible to programmatically access the docstring using the `__doc__` property. So, it is easy to write code which fetches such docs."
1055,2019-03-05T23:41:18.743100,Stan,"manpages have a format, and are idependent of the tool; you could write standalone manpages and 'man' could show them to you as readable docs. Docstrings are designed to live along with your code; either as an explainer for the module (at the top of the file) ..or per class, function etc."
1055,2019-03-05T23:42:16.744300,Stan,"Tools like Sphinx which generate user-documentation, are able to parse through your code and pull out docstrings automatically. This makes it easy to generate API docs. Typical case would be a docstring mentioning it's arguments, return values, exceptions raised etc."
1055,2019-03-05T23:49:12.747400,Stan,"Example:
Look at the docstring for Flask's application object from the code here:
<https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/86bf9dca72cd188813e26ef5dd972101ef8983cf/flask/app.py#L72>

The restructured text (.rst) which Sphinx operates on has been asked to fetch info from the class and all its members.
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pallets/flask/master/docs/api.rst>
```
Application Object
------------------

.. autoclass:: Flask
   :members:
   :inherited-members:
```

In the generated API documentation, the content you see came from the docstring
<http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/api/#application-object>

By embedding help as docstrings, you also have an advantage of keeping docs close to the code. You'd update it if you updated your code."

I have minimal experience with databases and this is for a startup where I do *everything*, so the keys are that it’s relatively simple to setup, reliable and easy to have it communicate with other apps (will automate as much of the data flow as possible)

 - Users will on my website fill in simple information (text) -&gt; Stored in db, user profile is created
 - Documents with user information will also be automatically created from templates -&gt; stored in db, not accessible to user
 - A new process will access those documents and send with email
 - New information will be added along
 - Non-technical people must be able to easily access the data in the db

The user will be able to login on website and access some of their data. I have looked into Google’s cloud SQL and it looks promising, but I’m a bit on the fence for what I should go for. Any suggestion is highly appreciated"
1057,2019-03-06T02:53:26.762400,Jimmy,<@Conchita> when in doubt choose postgresql. But if you are already hosting on a big cloud like GCP or AWS it's probably easier to use their databases offering
1057,2019-03-06T02:53:57.763100,Jimmy,and I would also advice against storing pdf / word documents in the db. What people usually do is store metadata about the file in the DB and the file itself on the filesystem

1061,2019-03-06T06:53:10.772700,Angele,The above snippet only takes a 1:1 correspondence

1062,2019-03-06T06:42:39.769900,Berenice,"I believe you have to use `close` but still the best approach is always to use:
```
with open(fname) as _:

```"
1063,2019-03-06T06:51:34.771700,Angele,"Hi...is there a way to iterate over all combinations of elements from multiple lists, without using multiple for loops?"
1063,2019-03-06T07:09:21.774000,Jonas,Look at the itertools module 
1063,2019-03-06T07:09:41.774600,Jonas,There is a product method that does what you require 
1063,2019-03-06T07:12:24.775000,Mica,or `combinations` if you're looking to avoid dups
1063,2019-03-06T07:13:27.775700,Kina,"Yeah, `combinations_with_replacement` in case you need that option"
1063,2019-03-06T07:13:32.775900,Kina,<https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/itertools.html?highlight=combinations>
1063,2019-03-06T10:52:20.782200,Arturo,when I use the library `win32` to send an outlook email it always stores it in the outbox and doesn't actually send the email until I open outlook by myself. Is there a way to overcome this?
1063,2019-03-06T10:57:37.783000,Marth,<@Arturo> What does your code currently look like?
1063,2019-03-06T11:06:06.786900,Arturo,"```
ol = win32.com.client.Dispatch('outlook.application')
mail = ol.CreateItem(0)
<http://mail.To|mail.To> = user_email
mail.Subject = ""Sub""
mail.Body = ""some text""
mail.Send()
```
<@Marth> this is what is currently does"
1063,2019-03-06T11:08:02.788600,Arturo,"for example I just sent one now, and nothing is received in the `user_email` inbox. But now as soon as I open outlook, it either sends it from the outbox or prompts me for ""need password"" but I thought it is meant to handle that on its own"
1063,2019-03-06T11:08:31.788700,Eric,"mm .. if you are running tests in parallel against the same db, even if first test would delete its data, you most likely could face problems... Maybe running the tests within transactions might help.  Or just isolate the database for each test process into separate instances."
1063,2019-03-06T11:08:33.788900,Gema,it’s like create new list from range but check if some keys from this range was used before
1063,2019-03-06T11:10:18.789400,Marth,"I wonder if there's a way to trigger ""Send/Receive"" ?"
1063,2019-03-06T11:10:30.789500,Minna,<@Eric> Do you know to make each process have it's own db?
1063,2019-03-06T11:11:07.790000,Jimmy,if it prompts for the password maybe it doesn't send because it needs credentials
1063,2019-03-06T11:11:12.790100,Lillia,You can use a dictionary comprehension
1063,2019-03-06T11:11:16.790300,Eric,set up 4 different databases and pass each test setup a individual connection url ?
1063,2019-03-06T11:12:04.790900,Marth,that's a good point too <@Jimmy>
1063,2019-03-06T11:12:10.791000,Arturo,I thought it was the case that it just sends it
1063,2019-03-06T11:12:32.791600,Arturo,but I get what you mean
1063,2019-03-06T11:13:27.792200,Arturo,is there a way to pass crendentials too?
1063,2019-03-06T11:13:39.792300,Gema,"<@Lillia> I need to do comprehension but serveral times, like `update` does it. Because it will overwrite it each time. Now I just extend my list with keys, so no keys will be lost.  Or there is some way to do it with dict comprehension?"
1063,2019-03-06T11:13:53.792500,Jimmy,no idea
1063,2019-03-06T11:14:27.793400,Jimmy,do you need to send the email from the user address ? it might be easier to connect to the company smtp relay with `<mailto:noreply@example.com|noreply@example.com>` address
1063,2019-03-06T11:14:28.793500,Marth,"sadly I don't know either.  I've done some credential passing in powershell, but haven't gotten there with python yet"
1063,2019-03-06T11:15:29.793600,Lillia,"So you can use `setdefault` to avoid overwriting existing keys, or just `if key not in d:`"
1063,2019-03-06T11:16:00.794400,Lillia,One sec let me write up a snippet
1063,2019-03-06T11:16:28.794900,Arturo,I need to reply to the senders address but we have to use outlook
1063,2019-03-06T11:17:18.795100,Arturo,think I figured a way
1063,2019-03-06T11:17:27.795400,Arturo,well report back shortly!
1063,2019-03-06T11:19:39.795500,Eric,"but depending on the db itself and the business logic, using transactions/rollbacks should be good approach to isolate tests."
1064,2019-03-06T07:38:42.777200,Angele,"Thanks. I don't quite get how `combinations` works: When I try the following: ```for e, lr, b in combinations_with_replacement(zip(epochs, learning_rates, batch_sizes), 3):
    print(e, lr, b)
```"
1064,2019-03-06T07:39:09.777700,Angele,"I get duplicate tuples of (e, lr, b)"
1064,2019-03-06T07:40:06.778200,Angele,"In my case, I have three iterables as input"
1064,2019-03-06T08:03:00.779100,Angele,Got it to work with itertools.product. Thanks <@Jonas>!

1067,2019-03-06T11:38:10.798900,Lillia,"Also you need to iterate over the lines in the opened file, not `file_name`"
1067,2019-03-06T11:38:27.799400,Lillia,You're just returning the first letter in `file_name`

1069,2019-03-06T13:04:20.803200,Nena,nope
1069,2019-03-06T13:04:36.803500,Nieves,Oh. Didn’t read carefully.
1069,2019-03-06T13:04:53.803900,Lillia,If the child raises the exception it'll go up the stack until caught
1069,2019-03-06T13:05:49.804500,Nena,"so how do i catch it on the parent, just the keyword is helpful, i will google it"
1069,2019-03-06T13:06:03.804800,Lillia,Try/except?
1069,2019-03-06T13:08:34.805100,Nena,None
1069,2019-03-06T13:09:12.805700,Lillia,Gotcha
1069,2019-03-06T13:09:35.806600,Lillia,Are you intentionally catching all exceptions and raising a specific one in `func2`?
1069,2019-03-06T13:09:47.807000,Nena,yup
1069,2019-03-06T13:10:12.807700,Lillia,Ok then you can `except some_exception_type:` and the parent will only catch that exception type
1069,2019-03-06T13:10:38.808200,Lillia,Whatever type `some_exception` is
1069,2019-03-06T13:10:57.808500,Nena,"okay <@Lillia> thanks again, let me try that out."
1069,2019-03-06T13:14:32.809300,Lillia,I like click but it's also an extra thing to install. `argparse` is just fine unless you're making something complex.
1069,2019-03-06T13:18:39.809500,Jamey,It's a command line client to access a news API.
1069,2019-03-06T13:20:43.809800,Lillia,Go with click then; it'll be more maintainable over time.
1069,2019-03-06T13:21:28.810000,Jamey,Thanks <@Lillia> :taco:
1069,2019-03-06T13:25:43.810200,Lillia,Yw!
1069,2019-03-06T13:38:10.815200,Lillia,You should read about mutable and immutable types in Python. tl;dr immutable types are always by value and mutable types are always by reference. That's not quite how it works in Python but it's analogous to other languages.
1070,2019-03-06T13:12:55.809000,Jamey,"Hello all. I wanted to know what is better to use if I'm starting out writing a command line interface in Python: `argparse` or `click`. If there is a suggestion that is neither of these two, it is also welcome. :slightly_smiling_face:
Edit: It's for interacting with the News API: <https://newsapi.org/>"
1070,2019-03-06T13:34:47.815100,Magan,"Rando questions. Though im trying to implement something from a C# that uses the `ref` keyword. Which basically allows the value to be passed by reference so that all functions are working with the last modified value thru different functions/scopes. So Python doesnt have this, so Ive opted to use the variable in a `list()` and pass the list around in functions.....and it seems to mostly work fine? Although, Im having an issue that i havent been able to debug fully yet. Though im just curious, if there were known caveats that may cause it not to work as I expect?"

1072,2019-03-06T14:59:49.822600,Jenice,Something like <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir> is probably where you'd start
1072,2019-03-06T15:01:47.823500,Jenice,then there's a bunch of path tools in <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html> but I vaguely recall there being some controversy over the *correct* path lib to use?
1072,2019-03-06T15:03:00.824400,Eric,i'd say that approach is  rather futile effort .. Applications in mac (just like any os really) can be anywhere..

1072,2019-03-06T15:15:47.826700,Clemmie,"I agree <@Eric>. If users are not supposed to be able to install applications, then they shouldn’t have administrator access on the machine. If they do, then the script will be trivially simple to evade"
1072,2019-03-06T16:17:10.828200,Carin,thank you <@Clemmie> <@Jenice> <@Eric> for taking time to check my problem :slightly_smiling_face:
1072,2019-03-06T17:13:50.832200,Eric,"start by splitting your problem into smaller chunks like ""how would i store the list of acceptable directories"". Then ""how would i populate the list of current directories"" and then ""how would i compare these two"" .. essentilly what you are asking is ""how can i get a diff of two arrays""."

1074,2019-03-06T19:16:52.844100,Jenice,oh hrm. I've only used it for integration tests to run against a beta website stack. I've never done much to optimize element search with it. Is that a noticeable bottleneck for you?

1079,2019-03-07T03:30:28.868600,Eric,it could be that you already have a single alive connection and you are trying to open a new one.

Selenium isn't a headless browser, but rather an abstraction around the WebDriver protocol with some extra bits to unify behavior between browsers so you can have the same selenium code hopefully do the same thing on every browser. It communicates with the various drivers for each browser to control them either locally or remotely (it's all network requests, so you can have selenium talk to the drivers over a network if you want), and, ideally, it tries to simulate how a real person would interact with the website (albeit much, much faster). The browsers it controls are not headless by default, but some of them support being run headless and you can have Selenium spin up a headless instance if you tell it to do so.

Regarding performance, a long, long time ago, ~in a world wide web far away,~ xpath used to perform better than normal CSS selectors, but even then, only in certain circumstances, and not by much. Nowadays, CSS selectors perform much better across the board. You should always try to use CSS selectors for a number of reasons (e.g. front end developer will be able to understand them easily, they're simpler and easier to write), but performance should not be a concern, especially if you're running e2e tests with selenium (it's already going to chug along relative to other types of tests, so shaving off .01 seconds of a 20 minute test run isn't really worth it). The _only_ time you should use XPATH is it you need some sort of logic in your locator that CSS selectors just can't do (and even then, there's often ways around it). For example, if you need to find an element that happens to have an element inside it with a certain attribute value, XPATH is needed, because CSS selectors can't traverse up the node tree to the parents/ancestors."

1084,2019-03-07T10:02:28.917400,Adolfo,no other logic at all
1084,2019-03-07T10:02:49.918200,Eric,"well, you can then only import the class *only* and still have access to the value pointed by DEFAULT_SETTING"
1084,2019-03-07T10:06:04.921300,Eric,"<@Izetta> first off, i have never used selenium directly from python, mainly via robotframework and such .. but if the question was would using lxml be a good idea?  Afaik, and i might be very wrong - that probably wont work or if it does, it wouldnt probably provide any speed improvements."
1084,2019-03-07T10:08:03.923700,Eric,"because selenium would still be in the middle and for lxml to get its magic, you would still need to wait for within seleniun context for page ready (and any async requests that might trigger dom changes) and only then get the page source .."
1084,2019-03-07T10:08:32.924700,Eric,"and . afaik, you would be more interested in live dom than the just the html .."
1084,2019-03-07T10:08:46.925400,Izetta,<@Eric>  what is robotframework 
1084,2019-03-07T10:08:54.925600,Eric,"so,atleat from my pov, lxml is probably not what you are looking for."
1084,2019-03-07T10:09:29.925900,Eric,<https://robotframework.org/> .. opensource automation framework ..
1084,2019-03-07T10:10:03.927100,Eric,"people will hate my for saying this but essentially:  ""Its like cucumber but with different syntax and written in python"""
1084,2019-03-07T10:10:55.928500,Izetta,<@Eric>  can I use it for web scraping 
1084,2019-03-07T10:11:47.929300,Eric,mm yes ?  but it will still be using selenium underneath it :smile:
1084,2019-03-07T10:12:50.930500,Izetta,"<@Eric>  then, I look into it "
1084,2019-03-07T10:13:34.931200,Eric,"so if you are familiar with sele &amp; python, robot itself wont add much except extra layer of abstraction .. *but* if not, keyword based automation might be a good fit. Depending in your requirements."
1084,2019-03-07T10:16:34.933100,Izetta,"<@Eric>  yeah, I am pretty familiar sele &amp; python"
1084,2019-03-07T10:30:38.934300,Eric,"while i like people getting introduced to rf,  i dont think you will get any extra features from using it"
1084,2019-03-07T10:49:22.936800,Ashley,"<@Izetta> Selenium is actually a _terrible_ scraping tool. It's built to work like a user, so it will be slow in many areas, and refuse to cooperate in others. (e.g. if an element has text, but isn't ""visible"", selenium will tell you it has no text). Using a full browser in general is also super slow, so you may want to explore other options. Robot is also a testing framework, so it's not really gonna offer you anything"
1084,2019-03-07T10:55:33.937600,Eric,testing &amp; *rpa* tool :slightly_smiling_face:
1085,2019-03-07T10:03:29.918900,Izetta,"<@Ashley> hey, I’m not using selenium for test purposes, I using it to make web scraper"
1086,2019-03-07T10:59:00.938700,Nieves,Selenium sucks. I hate it. 
1086,2019-03-07T11:13:15.939300,Lydia,"<@Nieves> why do you hate it? trying to use it here in my prod environment and Ive loved it, especially the headless mode"
1087,2019-03-07T12:06:48.939900,Karoline,I find their insistence on not providing the return code to be baffling
1087,2019-03-07T12:07:04.940300,Karoline,"I eventually figured a way around it, but it's like some sort of religious objection"
1087,2019-03-07T12:13:40.940600,Ashley,<@Karoline> because it's not in the WebDriver spec. It's not a selenium issue
1087,2019-03-07T12:14:33.942500,Karoline,"I mean it is in the sense that they could get it, and choose not to.   I've seen them reply on issues that it's not what the tool is for as if it were some sort of philosophical issue."
1087,2019-03-07T12:15:25.943500,Ashley,"Aside from that, it's geared towards behaving as a user so you can test from as close to a user's perspective as you can in automation. Users don't care about return codes"
1087,2019-03-07T12:15:43.944200,Karoline,"Right, but it's not a user.  It's a machine."
1087,2019-03-07T12:15:51.944600,Ashley,"If there's a problem, it should be evident from other things"
1087,2019-03-07T12:15:55.944800,Karoline,And lots of people have the use case of needing the return code.
1087,2019-03-07T12:16:13.945100,Ashley,It's a machine meant to behave like a person
1087,2019-03-07T12:16:26.945600,Ashley,"Developers have uses, sure"
1087,2019-03-07T12:16:32.945800,Karoline,I don't interact with my browsers via xpath
1087,2019-03-07T12:16:38.946000,Karoline,so that ship has sort of sailed lol
1087,2019-03-07T12:17:15.946500,Joette,"you're not clicking around with a cursor like some kind of monster, are you??"
1087,2019-03-07T12:17:21.946700,Ashley,That's not really a fair argument
1087,2019-03-07T12:17:58.948000,Karoline,"it is - because it's precisely my point.  it's a philosophical argument rather than a practical argument, and one that falls apart under cursory inspection."
1087,2019-03-07T12:18:36.948700,Ashley,It's a middleman between code and user. There's no magical means of a computer behaving exactly like a user in a predicable and deterministic manner
1087,2019-03-07T12:19:28.950100,Karoline,right.  so it's useful to be able to use these signals to avoid needing magic
1087,2019-03-07T12:20:51.950500,Ashley,"If you care about the status code, why are you trying to use Selenium? Why not hit the API directly?"
1087,2019-03-07T12:21:13.950800,Karoline,what API?  like use curl?
1087,2019-03-07T12:21:27.951100,Karoline,or requests or something?
1087,2019-03-07T12:21:47.951200,Ashley,Yeah
1087,2019-03-07T12:22:06.951900,Ashley,"The API for the backed, whatever form that takes"
1087,2019-03-07T12:22:16.952100,Karoline,many websites don't have a backend API
1087,2019-03-07T12:23:01.953300,Ashley,I'll rephrase
1087,2019-03-07T12:23:18.953800,Ashley,Why don't you hit the website's server directly?
1087,2019-03-07T12:23:34.954300,Ashley,Why bother going through the browser?
1087,2019-03-07T12:23:48.954800,Joette,"I get the objection here, b/c you may be checking status based on specific input added via the browser"
1087,2019-03-07T12:24:06.955400,Karoline,because sometimes the most reliable way to get data from a site is to be as close to a user as possible.
1087,2019-03-07T12:24:21.955800,Joette,"""For a logged in user, after do X and then Y and then Z verify that the resulting status code is XXX"""
1087,2019-03-07T12:24:34.956800,Joette,"that oughtn't be the primary test, but you may want to check that too"
1087,2019-03-07T12:24:56.958200,Ashley,"You can easily get around that by grabbing the cookies/user agent from the browser, and using them in your request"
1087,2019-03-07T12:24:58.958400,Joette,"verify both the visual result, e.g. error message, _and_ that the server responds with a specific code in _that_ status"
1087,2019-03-07T12:25:08.958800,Joette,but if you're _already doing these tests_
1087,2019-03-07T12:25:31.959700,Joette,the prescribed solution is to use testing middleware
1087,2019-03-07T12:25:33.959900,Karoline,"from which browser, the one driven by selenium?  that's sort of rube goldberg-esque"
1087,2019-03-07T12:25:59.961000,Ashley,"Selenium drives the browser, not the other way around"
1087,2019-03-07T12:26:08.961700,Karoline,that's exactly what I said?
1087,2019-03-07T12:26:11.961800,Ashley,"Sorry, sent before your edit"
1087,2019-03-07T12:26:15.962100,Karoline,ah
1087,2019-03-07T12:26:26.962500,Karoline,in the end I think I ended up parsing the performance logs for it
1087,2019-03-07T12:28:06.965700,Nena,"basically need to write a wildcard, which os handled by a func saying bad input or proceding with next data"
1087,2019-03-07T12:28:21.966200,Ashley,"If you're running e2e tests, checking the status code is more about testing implementation than behavior. You should be looking at what impact that has on behavior, rather than just checking it returns ""200""/""404""/""500""/etc"
1087,2019-03-07T12:29:19.967600,Ashley,"If you _really_ need that response status code, you can also just go through a proxy"
1087,2019-03-07T12:29:27.967800,Karoline,Not everybody is using selenium for e2e tests.
1087,2019-03-07T12:29:42.968200,Ashley,"I know, hence my comment about the proxy"
1087,2019-03-07T12:30:08.968900,Karoline,"the proxy is a huge hassle, the performance logs route isn't too bad when you figure it out - I've been meaning to put up a blog post on it"
1087,2019-03-07T12:30:34.969400,Karoline,"the big issue of course is that since there's a philosophical opposition to it, I wouldn't be shocked if this will break at some point"
1087,2019-03-07T12:30:37.969600,Karoline,because that's happened in the past
1087,2019-03-07T12:33:09.970800,Ashley,"The proxy is actually pretty easy to set up. Someone even made a python package for it, `browsermobproxy`"
1087,2019-03-07T12:33:31.971400,Ashley,What would break?
1087,2019-03-07T12:34:46.972900,Karoline,"my setup was containerized so that was a bit weird as my selenium client and the headless chrome instance were in different containers.  I imagine it could be setup, but it was more effort figuring it out than the performance log route"
1087,2019-03-07T12:34:56.973100,Sasha,"<@Nena> Have a look at `collections.defaultdict`, which allows you to have a default value for missing dictionary keys."
1087,2019-03-07T12:36:36.973700,Ashley,I mean what would break as a result of it being a philosophical opposition?
1087,2019-03-07T12:37:08.974300,Karoline,"It's just less than a priority, with approaches in the past messages I've seen on the web seemed to almost relish taking the ability to do it away."
1087,2019-03-07T12:37:50.974900,Karoline,"So who knows - but there have been other ways to do it and they've been removed/stopped working and the general response is just ""welp"""
1087,2019-03-07T12:40:02.975500,Ashley,So you mean their opposition may break
1087,2019-03-07T12:42:30.976000,Karoline,I mean techniques currently used to get the return code.  But if we want to continue the conversation probably should go to #testing_
1087,2019-03-07T12:43:31.976900,Jenice,wow selenium doesn't provide a status code? What does it tell you if you go looking for an element but the server responded with a 503 or something?
1087,2019-03-07T12:43:39.977100,Sasha,"You might run into a little weirdness since you want to have a function as the value, which `defaultdict` might interpret as a constructor instead of the value itself. So you might need to wrap that in a `lambda`."
1087,2019-03-07T12:44:46.977900,Nena,"running by the docs, will work something out. Thanks again for the guide."
1087,2019-03-07T12:44:54.978500,Ashley,It would tell you the element is not found
1087,2019-03-07T12:44:59.978900,Karoline,Probably best for us to take this to #testing_
1087,2019-03-07T12:45:05.979100,Ashley,Yeah
1087,2019-03-07T12:45:14.979400,Karoline,Which for some reason doesn't autolink :disappointed:
1087,2019-03-07T12:48:00.980500,Eric,Interested to read if you find the time to write it :)
1087,2019-03-07T12:49:05.981900,Eric,I know its a stretch but care to give out ideas what mobproxy can do ?
1087,2019-03-07T12:49:07.982100,Karoline,"yeah I really need to just get it done - I actually have a part 1 of using nightwatch with headless chrome in docker that I wanted to get out as sort of a primer for that but there's something weird about the setup I wrote in there, it doesn't work like the one I had previously used does.  so gotta figure that out first."
1088,2019-03-07T12:26:51.963300,Nena,"Hey Folks, have a dict something like this which maps to function based on the input,
```        function_map = {

I am using a third party library docx-mailmerge, to populate word mergefields (placeholders).

I have a field that doesn’t always have a value, but when it does, I’d like to append a space at the end. However, the library seems to strip that space.

Now my question, is there a whitespace character that isn’t stripped by function such as str.strip()?"

1089,2019-03-07T13:26:42.992200,Granville,"ah, I have another function it runs thru. That might be the issue. If I call the `printalllinesinfiles()` function, it works fine. Thanks for the help!"
1089,2019-03-07T13:30:01.993600,Nieves,Doesn’t seem to be ideal for most of my projects. Lol. That’s all. Maybe hate was a strong word? 
1090,2019-03-07T14:12:59.995800,Nenita,Anyone have experience with python and ip cameras?
1090,2019-03-07T14:16:22.996500,Nenita,pull data from the stored sd card
1090,2019-03-07T14:16:58.997300,Nenita,"im assuming itd be fairly simple, but just curious if anyone already has experience to help me with the 'do's-and-don'ts"""
1090,2019-03-07T14:17:50.997400,Jonas,Can't you take the sd card out?
1090,2019-03-07T14:18:12.997800,Jonas,"By that I mean isn't your problem ""python and SD cards""?"
1090,2019-03-07T14:18:16.998000,Nenita,"Yes, but there will be 11 cameras over 11 locations"
1090,2019-03-07T14:18:45.998600,Ashley,let's go a step higher
1090,2019-03-07T14:18:48.998900,Nenita,I will have to design some system to pull the data frequently and store the info in a database. it has to have some sort of automation
1090,2019-03-07T14:18:56.999100,Ashley,why are you pulling the data from the SD car if they're IP cameras?
1090,2019-03-07T14:19:05.999300,Nenita,lpr cameras more specifically
1090,2019-03-07T14:19:35.999800,Nenita,one sec. i should have specified more in the beginning.
1090,2019-03-07T14:21:49.002300,Nenita,"we plan to have 11 lpr cameras over 11 locations and will need to compare that data with our database. it will need to be automated therefore I need to design some system to pull the data from the 11 cameras. There is plenty software designed for this, but the camera is what does the lpr - not the software - so that is why i am using python rather than installing software on every single computer."
1090,2019-03-07T14:22:13.002600,Ashley,Ipr?
1090,2019-03-07T14:22:21.002900,Nenita,license plate recognition
1090,2019-03-07T14:22:38.003100,Ashley,lol wut
1090,2019-03-07T14:22:51.003500,Ashley,what's the brand/model of these cameras?
1090,2019-03-07T14:24:59.003800,Nenita,<https://digital-watchdog.com/productdetail/DWC-MB44iALPR/>
1090,2019-03-07T14:25:13.004200,Nenita,that exact camera from that exact provider.
1090,2019-03-07T14:25:51.004400,Ashley,hmmm
1090,2019-03-07T14:26:07.004800,Ashley,"looks like they don't recognize what the plate actually says, just that it's a license plate"
1090,2019-03-07T14:26:20.005000,Ashley,and it gets a clean image of it
1090,2019-03-07T14:27:37.006400,Nenita,it has the lpr built in. it only stores the image and text of the plate for a limited period. all the extra software from dw that i dont want to install is for viewing the cameras. the software does no part of the license plate recognition. that is why I am choosing to design something in python to just pull and compare the data.
1090,2019-03-07T14:28:29.007100,Ashley,I got something for you that I think you'll love
1090,2019-03-07T14:28:32.007300,Ashley,it's not python
1090,2019-03-07T14:28:35.007500,Ashley,it's node
1090,2019-03-07T14:28:38.007800,Nenita,js?

1090,2019-03-07T14:28:52.008700,Ashley,I talk with the creator on discord
1090,2019-03-07T14:28:57.008900,Nenita,lol it seems i will have to learn java at some point or another
1090,2019-03-07T14:29:03.009200,Ashley,javascript*
1090,2019-03-07T14:29:12.009500,Ashley,(very different from java)
1090,2019-03-07T14:29:31.010200,Nenita,duly noted.
1090,2019-03-07T14:29:33.010300,Ashley,"Shinobi has a plugin system, and one of the plugins is OpenALPR (license plate recognition)"
1090,2019-03-07T14:29:43.010700,Nenita,oh sweet
1090,2019-03-07T14:29:53.011100,Ashley,but OpenALPR actually pulls the license plate from the video feed
1090,2019-03-07T14:30:00.011400,Ashley,and figures out what the text is
1090,2019-03-07T14:30:27.012200,Nenita,thats perfect. that is exactly the answer i was hoping for.
1090,2019-03-07T14:30:30.012300,Ashley,"it also supports video stream pass through, so you don't have to re-encode the video stream to store it"
1090,2019-03-07T14:30:55.012900,Ashley,it's literally the only security camera software system I've found that does this
1090,2019-03-07T14:31:59.014200,Nenita,has anyone ever told you you are awesome?
1090,2019-03-07T14:32:11.014300,Ashley,"it also supports handling multiple streams from a single camera so you can do stuff like use the high quality feed for live streaming, and a lower quality feed for license plate recognition (easier to process)"
1090,2019-03-07T14:32:23.014600,Ashley,"lol yeah, but it's always fun hearing it :joy:"
1090,2019-03-07T14:32:36.015100,Ashley,do you have any docs for that camera?
1090,2019-03-07T14:32:36.015200,Nenita,lmao :laughing:

I'm just doing `c.execute(""SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=?"", username)` and getting `Incorrect number of bindings supplied. The current statement uses 1, and there are 4 supplied.` ... the number supplied is always the length of the string in ""username"""

Do people find pipenv better with dependency management than just using a plain setup file or requirements file, or have people encountered issues with pipenvs virtual environments"

1099,2019-03-08T02:40:39.050200,Natosha,good day
1099,2019-03-08T02:41:38.051200,Natosha,is it possible to read a Windows file from Linux using python?
1099,2019-03-08T04:35:25.056400,Natosha,thanks <@Eric>
1099,2019-03-08T04:36:13.057200,Natosha,can you suggest a library that I can use for that scenario?
1100,2019-03-08T03:25:21.052200,Eric,"depends, could you elaborate ?"
1100,2019-03-08T03:40:46.055700,Eric,"on short, answer is yes.. there's nothing that prevents ""reading windows files"" in python / linux, if the file accessible somehow. Another question is if the file actually resides in windows partition, you need to mount the partition first and depending on your linux and what filesystem that partition is, it might be problematic but that part has nothing to do with python itself."
1100,2019-03-08T04:36:29.057700,Eric,for which scenario ?
1100,2019-03-08T04:39:20.058400,Eric,for reading a file or for mounting ?  i dont think you should rely on  a library but properly configure your system ..
1100,2019-03-08T04:41:03.058600,Natosha,for reading a file
1100,2019-03-08T04:41:22.059100,Natosha,i did some research and I found pysmb
1100,2019-03-08T04:42:26.060500,Natosha,can I use that or is there anything else you can recommend?
1100,2019-03-08T04:45:34.060900,Natosha,that is easier
1100,2019-03-08T04:51:37.062800,Eric,The Easiest way is to mount first in OS level and then reading can be done without any external libs. 
1100,2019-03-08T04:52:42.063600,Eric,"But then again, your question is still a bit vague.  "
1100,2019-03-08T05:10:05.069100,Natosha,"oh sorry, what I'm planning to do is to deploy my script on a Linux environment(because I find cron works better than windows task scheduler) but the problem is the file that I need to read is in Windows environment the reason why is that from time to time an end user will have to update the excel file"
1100,2019-03-08T05:48:13.070000,Natosha,yes but same network
1100,2019-03-08T06:43:52.074200,Elisha,Can someone give some idea how to write a code for packet rerouting using python? Thanks in advance
1101,2019-03-08T05:31:09.069700,Eric,And your windows env is a separate computer ?
1102,2019-03-08T06:04:40.070400,Yaeko,Set up a network share on the linux server and mount that on the windows machines?
1102,2019-03-08T06:05:10.071100,Yaeko,That way you will have easy access to the file for scripting (and backup/version control/whatever you need) while the windows users can edit it as they want
1102,2019-03-08T06:06:04.072000,Yaeko,Additional advantage is that multiple windows machines can the edit the file as well.

but it fails because of the `BootstrapArguments`,"
1104,2019-03-08T13:58:32.080500,Sasha,I don't see where you're using the `eks_cluster_name` variable at all.
1104,2019-03-08T14:01:06.081300,Carlota,sorry <@Sasha> did not noticed that I pasted the “current” code.  This is the code that I tried to use but it is failing because of the `BoostrapArguments`.
1104,2019-03-08T14:02:51.082200,Sasha,"So if I understand you correctly, you want to have `format()` substitute for one set of braces, but leave the others alone?"
1104,2019-03-08T14:03:03.082500,Carlota,that’s correct!
1104,2019-03-08T14:03:26.083300,Sasha,"I'd construct the string in two pieces, then."
1104,2019-03-08T14:03:41.083700,Carlota,I need to let the other ones like `${BootstrapArguments}` because those will be _substituted_ by the `Sub` Troposphere lib.
1104,2019-03-08T14:04:50.084500,Sasha,"Alternately, you can use old-style string formatting with `%s` instead of braces."
1104,2019-03-08T14:06:34.084700,Carlota,like so: ```/etc/eks/bootstrap.sh %s ${BootstrapArguments}```
1104,2019-03-08T14:08:28.085300,Carlota,"ah, no"
1104,2019-03-08T14:08:30.085500,Carlota,that’s wrong

1104,2019-03-08T14:08:41.086200,Sasha,Yep. The other thing you can do is use `{{ }}` for your literal braces that you don't want substituted for.
1104,2019-03-08T14:10:43.086700,Carlota,"would that look like something like this:
```/etc/eks/bootstrap.sh {ClusterName} {{${BootstrapArguments}}}```"
1104,2019-03-08T14:11:56.088000,Sasha,"No, it would be like `{ClusterName} ${{BootstrapArguments}}`. The `format()` will convert the double braces back to singles as part of the substitution, but it won't look for a variable for them."

I have table library that is taking javascript array of objects e.g. `[ {name: 'John', surname: 'Doe' } ]` and rendering it in table.
In Python I used to do `render(request, 'users/list.html, { 'objects': serializers.serialize(User.objects.all()) })` but I was missing URLs and I don't want to generate them in JavaScript. I would like to enhance serialized data with `get_absolute_url` so my serialized object in JavaScript has `user.absolute_url` (string value).
I did not find a way how to do that with in built Django serializer `from django.core import serializers` so I plugged in DRF.

1119,2019-03-09T12:05:48.151300,Nieves,<@Otelia> Python is weird in general... I am also not the best to ask the question to.
1119,2019-03-09T12:07:09.152400,Chester,<@Nieves> because `while` is used when you need to iterate. That snippet already has iteration code presented by the `for` loop.

1119,2019-03-09T12:08:54.155700,Chester,`for` in python is like `foreach` in other languages

Essentially what I want to do is when a user clicks this link:

<http://domain.com/page?email=some@email.com&amp;source=twitter|domain.com/page?email=some@email.com&amp;source=twitter>

I want a function that collects the values `<mailto:some@email.com|some@email.com>` and `twitter` from the url, and pass them along to a url inside my html doc.

Replace the `xxxx` and `yyyy` with those variables in `src=""https://*****.<http://typeform.com/to/*****?epost=xxxx&amp;fornavn=yyyy|typeform.com/to/*****?epost=xxxx&amp;fornavn=yyyy>""`

I have found this JS function to get the variable names passed in the url, but I have no idea on how to call and use those variables. Any help is highly appreciated!

```    &lt;script&gt;
    function getQueryVariable(variable)
    {
            var query = window.location.search.substring(1);

As I understand this will get slower and slower with each new data in log so what i should use to make it fast as possible ? log file contains a one message per line and other program writes new ones at the end of file when he gets one.
1128,2019-03-11T06:46:53.224700,Chester,<@Joel> you can remember the last processed position and do `seek` to that position later to avoid re-reading the whole file again

1132,2019-03-11T11:45:45.250000,Arturo,"ok still getting a bit stuck on my import modules question from earlier. My packages looks like this so far;

```
osp/
    __init__.py
    utils_functions.py
    vsw_test.py
    read_email.py
     m_cmds.py
```
In the `utils_functions` module I have a function called `click_item` which has the code;

```
coords = None
while coords == None:
    try:
           pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen(""img.png"")
    except:
            if 'return_val' in kwargs:
                coords = True
                return coords
            else:
                coords = None

                 if count == 6:
                      #I want this to go back to __init__.py
```
I call this code multiple times from the other modules such as `vsw_test.py` `m_cmds.py` a number of times. `vsw_test` calls `m_cmds` within it. Not sure if it is possible to go back to `read_email` or `__init__`.

Would I be able to call within the exception?

```

if __name__ == 'read_email':
    read_email()

If none of the other values will have an `@` sign, then that's a simple loop to check. More complicated would be a regex filter. And if you need to recognize a standards-compliant email address versus something that is close but not quite right, it's probably time to pull out a library, as that's quite messy in general."

1165,2019-03-13T10:23:37.434800,Karoline,The big thing for testing with serverless is honestly the same with testing otherwise - make sure it's easy to decouple your code from whatever is calling it (i.e. the serverless framework) and then test against expected inputs.

1167,2019-03-13T12:16:24.457000,Hiroko,interesting to see DI in python
1167,2019-03-13T12:16:36.457400,Hiroko,"doesn’t really have too much of a place in dynamic languages, IMO"
1167,2019-03-13T12:17:55.458400,Carlo,what do you mean?
1167,2019-03-13T12:18:23.458900,Hiroko,DI is used to dynamically bind dependencies based on a configuration
1167,2019-03-13T12:18:45.459500,Hiroko,"with java, you would need it because its a statically typed language"
1167,2019-03-13T12:19:00.460100,Hiroko,"so you can inject dependencies at runtime, rather than compiletime"
1167,2019-03-13T12:19:14.460600,Hiroko,"with dynamic languages like python, well.. its dynamic"
1167,2019-03-13T12:19:37.461300,Hiroko,"so you don’t need that injection, because its already built in the language features"

1167,2019-03-13T12:48:10.466300,Carlo,"<@Ted> basically dependency injection is a subset of a pattern known as Inversion of Control, basically meaning objects/functions receive their dependencies instead of creating them themselves"

1168,2019-03-13T12:48:29.466700,Carlo,DI is a way to provide these dependencies to the dependants

1169,2019-03-13T14:26:32.478400,Hiroko,you could use a lambda?
1169,2019-03-13T14:29:38.478900,Joette,you could get the `[0]` index?
1169,2019-03-13T14:31:10.479500,Romelia,I've done the `[0]` trick before but wondered if there were other ways
1169,2019-03-13T14:37:16.480000,Joette,you could use a generator expression and `next`
1169,2019-03-13T14:37:29.480300,Joette,`next((i for in in some_list))`
1169,2019-03-13T14:37:56.480800,Joette,I don't see any problem with using the list index though
1169,2019-03-13T14:41:05.481500,Romelia,Just felt dirty to me for some reason :stuck_out_tongue:
1169,2019-03-13T14:42:39.481900,Joette,put it in a `try/except IndexError` block and call it a day ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1169,2019-03-13T14:44:14.483400,Romelia,"Perhaps `var = "","".join([i for i in list_of_thing if i == x])` would work?"
1169,2019-03-13T14:44:57.484000,Romelia,"That way, if there WAS more than one output in the list for some reason at least it would return one value?"
1169,2019-03-13T14:45:19.484600,Sasha,"Does the `[0]` work with a generator, or does it require a list conversion?"
1169,2019-03-13T14:45:31.485200,Joette,it requires a list
1169,2019-03-13T14:45:52.485800,Joette,"rather, it won't work with a generator, unless you use `list` first"
1170,2019-03-13T13:47:49.473600,Carlo,meh
1170,2019-03-13T13:48:31.474300,Carlo,"I might not like it that much, but it didn't get to where it is by being _that_ terrible I guess :stuck_out_tongue:"
1170,2019-03-13T13:49:05.475000,Carlo,but again I work with a lot of PHP and JS so I probably like pain a little bit too much?
1171,2019-03-13T14:21:34.477200,Romelia,Is there such a thing as a Comprehension (like a list comprehension or dict comprehension) that does not return an iterable?
1172,2019-03-13T15:53:44.488500,Claudine,eh i hate to be a crossposting crossposter but if anyone loves dealing with wonky noob `import` bugs and doesn't follow <#C07EW4DNE|learning_python> i just wall-of-text'd over there
1172,2019-03-13T18:35:42.491700,Kendra,was wrong.
1172,2019-03-13T18:36:49.493100,Kendra,It probably uses `.mro()`
1172,2019-03-13T18:37:00.493500,Kendra,but if you want to know details you'd have to look into C code
1172,2019-03-13T18:37:45.494600,Kendra,why do you need to know this?
1172,2019-03-13T18:38:45.497000,Angele,"I have a 4D Numpy array from which I want to delete the first two elements around axis 0. I tried ```A = A[2:,:,:,:]```"
1172,2019-03-13T18:38:53.497500,Angele,But the result looks incorrect
1172,2019-03-13T18:38:54.497600,Tasha,"ahh, at work today another developer asked me to just use the parent class to catch the exceptions, lik ein the example"
1172,2019-03-13T18:39:01.498000,Tasha,i just cant understand hjow it works lol
1172,2019-03-13T18:39:23.498900,Tasha,"i know Python looks up the class tree from the child upwards, not the other way around"
1172,2019-03-13T18:40:10.500100,Kendra,"well, if you have an instance of ""ChildError"""
1172,2019-03-13T18:40:32.500500,Kendra,then python goes through the `except` statements
1172,2019-03-13T18:40:40.500800,Ashley,"<@Tasha> this is basically just inheritance. Python will catch the error, since it's in a `try` block, and then see if you want to catch that particular error by checking your `except` blocks in sequence (much like if/elif/else blocks). Every class in Python has a linearized chain of ancestors. This linearization is determined through a process called ""Method Resolution Order"" (MRO), which can be tricky, but there's a great talk by Raymond Hettinger called ""Super Considered Super"" which does a great job of explaining it. With the MRO chain established, Python can quickly and easily check to see if you want to catch that error"
1172,2019-03-13T18:41:32.501100,Kendra,and looks if class in `except` is in `ChildError`'s `__bases__`
1172,2019-03-13T18:41:59.501800,Carina,"There’s also this, which is a bit tough to read but technically how the MRO sausage is made: <https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/>"
1172,2019-03-13T18:42:28.502800,Kendra,"```In [1]: class ParentException(Exception): pass                                                                          

In [2]: class ChildException(ParentException): pass                                                                     

In [3]: exc = ChildException()

Out[4]: (__main__.ParentException,)```"
1172,2019-03-13T18:42:34.503100,Ashley,"In terms of your example, it would be caught (assuming you raised the exception in the try block) because the child exception _is_ its parent in a certain sense. It's just an extension on the parent"
1172,2019-03-13T18:43:39.504200,Ashley,"If python determines that you didn't want to catch that error, it just lets it get raised as if it wasn't in a try block"
1172,2019-03-13T18:43:44.504300,Kendra,"in approximation it's like doing `isinstance(exc, SomeException)`"
1172,2019-03-13T18:47:30.505700,Tasha,but this type of i inheritance only works with Exceptions..?
1172,2019-03-13T18:47:53.505900,Kendra,all classes
1172,2019-03-13T18:50:08.508200,Tasha,"``` class Parent():
    pass
  
class Child(Parent):
    message = ""hello""

1172,2019-03-13T18:50:37.509200,Tasha,I know this is not the same
1172,2019-03-13T18:50:52.510000,Ashley,"As <@Kendra> said, this is all classes in Python. It's just how inheritance works. Python needed a way to linearize inheritance in the event that a class inherits from multiple classes at once, so they came up with MRO. MRO can also be utilized for things like dependency injection, which is fairly advanced, but very useful"
1172,2019-03-13T18:51:21.510800,Ashley,<@Tasha> changing the child does not change the parent
1172,2019-03-13T18:51:22.510900,Tasha,ok greast
1172,2019-03-13T18:51:46.511700,Ashley,That's part of the reason you would inherit
1172,2019-03-13T18:51:57.512200,Ashley,"Think of a class called ""Fruit"""
1172,2019-03-13T18:52:05.512600,Tasha,ok
1172,2019-03-13T18:52:33.513400,Ashley,"It has all the info you could have about, and all the things you could do with a generic fruit, but it isn't any fruit in particular"
1172,2019-03-13T18:52:43.513700,Tasha,right
1172,2019-03-13T18:52:53.514200,Ashley,Then inherit from it and make an Apple class
1172,2019-03-13T18:53:25.515100,Ashley,"That class gets all the things from the Fruit class, but has the opportunity to add or adjust things"
1172,2019-03-13T18:53:51.515900,Tasha,"``` class Fruit():
    taste = ""sweet""
    color = ""defualt""

class Apple(Fruit):
    color = ""red"" ```"
1172,2019-03-13T18:54:04.516200,Ashley,Close
1172,2019-03-13T18:54:17.516600,Ashley,"Not all fruits are sweet, but you get the idea"
1172,2019-03-13T18:54:23.516800,Tasha,ok
1172,2019-03-13T18:54:30.517100,Tasha,so how do i use Fruit()
1172,2019-03-13T18:54:39.517400,Tasha,and some how call all its child classes
1172,2019-03-13T18:54:56.517800,Ashley,Why would you want to?
1172,2019-03-13T18:55:10.518400,Tasha,except Fruit as err
1172,2019-03-13T18:55:10.518700,Tasha,lol
1172,2019-03-13T18:55:48.519600,Ashley,The parent doesn't  usually need to know about its descendents
1172,2019-03-13T18:55:55.520000,Tasha,yes thats right
1172,2019-03-13T18:55:55.520100,Ashley,But yes
1172,2019-03-13T18:56:03.520600,Ashley,That's how you would do it for an exception
1172,2019-03-13T18:56:06.520700,Tasha,i havent come across this before in 5 years of developing lol
1172,2019-03-13T18:56:24.521400,Tasha,i have studied IOC container DI
1172,2019-03-13T18:56:26.521600,Tasha,SOLId
1172,2019-03-13T18:56:27.521800,Ashley,You haven't come across inheritance in 5 years of development?
1172,2019-03-13T18:56:29.522000,Tasha,etc
1172,2019-03-13T18:56:32.522200,Tasha,"functional, erlang"
1172,2019-03-13T18:56:41.522400,Tasha,and i dont know how this works lol
1172,2019-03-13T18:56:55.522700,Tasha,i understand inheritance
1172,2019-03-13T18:56:59.522900,Tasha,solid principles
1172,2019-03-13T18:57:00.523100,Tasha,etc
1172,2019-03-13T18:57:21.523600,Tasha,but i dont understand how python Exceptions reach down to the child classes
1172,2019-03-13T18:58:42.526500,Ashley,"Oh, yeah, they don't"
1172,2019-03-13T18:59:05.528000,Ashley,The parent class can be completely unaware that it has descendants
1172,2019-03-13T18:59:29.529900,Tasha,I have read that Python's inheritance tree goes upwards untl the base class
1172,2019-03-13T18:59:39.530400,Ashley,Python in the one checking that the exception that was raised inherits from any of the exception classes you want to catch
1172,2019-03-13T18:59:53.530900,Clemmie,"They don't, and it isn't exception specific. When you had except parent it caught child because child inherited from parent. Python, via the mro, knows that "
1172,2019-03-13T19:01:02.534200,Clemmie,"It is the reverse if what you said really. Child knows it inherits from parent,but parent doesn't necessarily know what inherits from itself"
1172,2019-03-13T19:01:19.534900,Ashley,"there's ""old"" style classes, and ""new"" style classes. I believe in Python 3, old style classes don't exist anymore, but basically, the difference is that in old style classes, they don't extend all the way up to the `object` class, and in new style classes, they do"
1172,2019-03-13T19:01:31.535500,Tasha,can you give me an example outside of Exceptions whereby  python can expose a classes child /sub classes?
1172,2019-03-13T19:01:49.536300,Ashley,that doesn't really happen often
1172,2019-03-13T19:01:53.536700,Ashley,you'd have to implement that yourself
1172,2019-03-13T19:01:59.537100,Clemmie,"So, effectively, when you did except parent, child says ""I am a type of parent"" and is caught"
1172,2019-03-13T19:02:05.537300,Ashley,"like we said, the parent is unaware of the children"
1172,2019-03-13T19:02:28.537900,Tasha,ahh great thanks
1172,2019-03-13T19:02:36.538300,Clemmie,Using parent/child as the terms also confuses it a bit
1172,2019-03-13T19:02:44.538600,Ashley,yeah
1172,2019-03-13T19:03:11.539900,Tasha,super / sub classes
1172,2019-03-13T19:03:15.540400,Ashley,"<@Tasha> make a class that inherits from a few other classes, and then call `__mro__` on it (I think that's the attribute)"
1172,2019-03-13T19:03:28.541000,Tasha,ok cool!
1172,2019-03-13T19:03:29.541300,Ashley,that might clear it up a bit
1172,2019-03-13T19:03:34.541600,Clemmie,"Like apple knows it is a fruit, and will respond as such, but fruit doesn't need to know what fruits there are"
1172,2019-03-13T19:03:45.541900,Tasha,thats it!
1172,2019-03-13T19:03:49.542100,Tasha,haha now i understand
1172,2019-03-13T19:04:40.543800,Tasha,"So python must be looking at any class that extends from Exception , right down the tree of subclasses?"
1172,2019-03-13T19:04:41.543900,Ashley,"yep. Python basically sees you're trying to catch `Fruit`, and goes `if Fruit in Apple.__mro__: # actually catch it`"
1172,2019-03-13T19:05:10.544600,Ashley,"oh, no it doesn't really care about all classes that extend from exception"
1172,2019-03-13T19:05:33.545200,Ashley,it pretty much does `if Fruit in Apple.__mro__: # actually catch it`
1172,2019-03-13T19:05:40.545600,Tasha,ahh so its looks here: SubClassException(Exception) &lt; -------- here
1172,2019-03-13T19:05:44.545700,Ashley,because it saw `catch Fruit`
1172,2019-03-13T19:05:55.545900,Ashley,kind of
1172,2019-03-13T19:06:06.546200,Ashley,MRO is a lot more complex than what's listed in there
1172,2019-03-13T19:06:07.546400,Tasha,ok
1172,2019-03-13T19:06:17.546800,Tasha,is this in Java?
1172,2019-03-13T19:06:34.547600,Ashley,"watch Super Considered Super, and it should explain it pretty well"
1172,2019-03-13T19:06:40.548000,Ashley,Java doesn't have this
1172,2019-03-13T19:06:56.548900,Ashley,"Java actually has what I think is called a ""death triangle of inheritance"""
1172,2019-03-13T19:07:08.549400,Ashley,or something like that
1172,2019-03-13T19:07:23.550000,Tasha,"I wondered how my boss new how this works, he isnt great at all at Python, he comes from Java/ ruby"
1172,2019-03-13T19:07:27.550400,Ashley,"basically, multiple inheritance can go awry very quickly in Java"
1172,2019-03-13T19:07:44.550800,Clemmie,"Well, does java have what exactly?"
1172,2019-03-13T19:07:46.550900,Ashley,Python avoids that problem with MRO
1172,2019-03-13T19:08:35.551800,Tasha,I just wondered how he knew straight away i can just use our custom parent exception class and all the sub classes would be caught as well
1172,2019-03-13T19:08:53.552000,Tasha,its really a head teaser
1172,2019-03-13T19:09:00.552300,Tasha,"brain teaser, rather lol"
1172,2019-03-13T19:09:18.552500,Tasha,but thanks guys
1172,2019-03-13T19:09:22.552700,Tasha,explained very well
1172,2019-03-13T19:09:33.553000,Tasha,im going to quiz him tomorrow on the technicals of this
1172,2019-03-13T19:09:41.553400,Ashley,ah found it
1172,2019-03-13T19:09:42.553500,Tasha,im sure he would have no idea or MRO
1172,2019-03-13T19:10:02.554100,Ashley,"Java has what's called the ""deadly diamond of death"" (I'm not making that up)"
1172,2019-03-13T19:10:16.554300,Tasha,]haha
1172,2019-03-13T19:10:21.554500,Tasha,love it
1172,2019-03-13T19:10:51.554900,Raguel,I want to know etymology of that phrase now
1172,2019-03-13T19:11:23.555800,Ashley,it's a diamond of inheritance
1172,2019-03-13T19:11:29.556200,Ashley,and it kills your program dead
1172,2019-03-13T19:11:32.556500,Ashley,deadly death
1172,2019-03-13T19:11:44.556900,Clemmie,"I mean, java does have generics, which can get you close to mro like behavior, in a staticly typed, verbose way"
1172,2019-03-13T19:13:21.557100,Tasha,ok
1172,2019-03-13T19:14:57.559800,Tasha,rightmost depth first resolution
1172,2019-03-13T19:15:11.560400,Tasha,does that mean literally 'right'? lol
1172,2019-03-13T19:15:12.560600,Clemmie,"The best thing about the mro is the deterministic way it identifies in what order things are inherited when using multi-inheritence, based on the declaration order. (Which is the deadly diamond issue)"
1172,2019-03-13T19:15:20.560800,Tasha,thank god i never learnt Ruby
1172,2019-03-13T19:15:21.561000,Tasha,haha
1172,2019-03-13T19:15:58.562000,Tasha,yes just read it uses the base class's tuple order
1172,2019-03-13T19:16:11.562400,Clemmie,Exactly
1172,2019-03-13T19:16:29.562900,Tasha,but Ruby's : rightmost depth first resolution
1172,2019-03-13T19:16:30.563100,Tasha,lol
1172,2019-03-13T19:16:46.563800,Tasha,is that literally : 'right'
1172,2019-03-13T19:16:57.564100,Tasha,so it would always take the right side of the diamond?
1172,2019-03-13T19:17:05.564400,Tasha,before the left class
1172,2019-03-13T19:17:46.565500,Tasha,sorry getting off topic
1172,2019-03-13T19:17:59.565900,Clemmie,It will always look first to the rightmost defined class for a method/variable resolution
1172,2019-03-13T19:18:33.566700,Tasha,ok
1172,2019-03-13T19:18:44.567300,Tasha,so then it's a form or module resolution
1172,2019-03-13T19:19:10.568000,Tasha,"method, rather"
1172,2019-03-13T19:19:12.568200,Tasha,yes
1172,2019-03-13T19:19:17.568400,Tasha,man thanks so much\
1172,2019-03-13T19:19:18.568600,Tasha,!

1172,2019-03-13T19:20:32.570100,Clemmie,:taco:  <@Tasha> for good questions on your first day here
1172,2019-03-13T19:21:16.570300,Tasha,haha thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
1172,2019-03-13T19:22:32.571900,Clemmie,No prob. Generally the community just uses a :pacman: response on the :taco: 
1172,2019-03-13T19:25:35.572300,Tasha,haha
1172,2019-03-13T19:27:10.573100,Tasha,great channel btw
1172,2019-03-13T19:27:15.573300,Tasha,just found it tonight
1173,2019-03-13T17:54:03.489600,Tasha,hi
1173,2019-03-13T17:54:22.490100,Tasha,"HI, I'm confused! When i create a custom class that inherites from Exception, then i extend this class with subclasses, how does Python reverse the lookup to the base class?
```
class ParentError(Exception):

    message(""parent msg"")

class ChildError(Parent):

    message("" child msg"")

# raise an error somewhere:

raise ChildError()

    # then somewhere catch the Child error via the Parent:
  
try:

except Parent as err:

   . # catches ChildError() ...? ```"
1173,2019-03-13T17:57:50.490500,Tasha,with `__subclasses__()`?
1173,2019-03-13T18:36:21.492400,Tasha,ok thanks anyway
1173,2019-03-13T18:46:22.504900,Tasha,thanks very much <@Ashley>
1174,2019-03-13T18:29:05.490900,Kendra,my guess is that it just uses `isinstance()` check
1175,2019-03-13T19:19:06.567800,Clemmie,That's precisely what it is
1175,2019-03-13T19:39:10.574600,Clemmie,"Most of the regulars do, yes"
1176,2019-03-13T19:35:31.574200,Tasha,are you guys working in python roles?
1176,2019-03-13T19:50:50.575500,Nieves,Not me... Python I use for personal projects.
1176,2019-03-13T20:09:11.576100,Tasha,"ok cool, yea ive been full time python for the last 3 months"
1176,2019-03-13T20:09:34.576700,Tasha,"before did Node, Erlang, VB"
1176,2019-03-13T20:10:11.577100,Tasha,loved python for a long time though
1176,2019-03-13T20:11:58.579200,Tasha,was tempted to try out Go but Python just keeps calling me back lol
1177,2019-03-13T20:43:14.579700,Nieves,Go is weird
1177,2019-03-13T20:43:22.580000,Nieves,I see its use though
1177,2019-03-13T21:11:40.583700,Nieves,lol
1177,2019-03-13T21:11:42.583900,Nieves,403?
1177,2019-03-13T21:12:01.584700,Nieves,lolol
1177,2019-03-13T21:12:36.585300,Ursula,:stuck_out_tongue: :sob:
1177,2019-03-13T21:12:57.585700,Nieves,I am just a weirdo... I don't know anything.
1177,2019-03-13T21:13:12.586000,Ursula,(sigh) nooooooo!
1177,2019-03-13T21:16:04.587500,Adolfo,"Question:
In Python 3.6 this code block fails with `complaining that config is not a module`
```Script file: /my_prog/somescript.py
Config files: /myprog/config/config.py
from config.config import Config fails```

In python 3.5 this works.
```
Script file: /my_prog/somescript.py
Config files: /myprog/config/config.py
from config.config import Config fails
```
To make it work on python 3.6 I had to do
`from config import Config`

Anyone happen to know why?"

1178,2019-03-13T21:10:26.582900,Ursula,"Anyone familiar with Amazon API Gateway know why I am getting the error below when I try to submit a file to s3? I have double checked my resources/methods and even re-created them and checked my s3 bucket settings as well, the logs for my lambda show that my file isn't being hit at all and I am deeply confused at the moment :thinking_face: :confused: :confounded:
`Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at...`"
1178,2019-03-13T21:11:56.584300,Ursula,Yep
1179,2019-03-13T21:32:56.587900,Hiroko,<@Joanne> have you enabled cors for that bucket?
1179,2019-03-13T21:55:05.590300,Ursula,"<@Hiroko> yes, I have enabled CORS on the bucket, although it is slightly different from that one"
1179,2019-03-13T21:56:55.590600,Ursula,<@Hiroko> I am using this since I am uploading directly to the bucket (getting permissions with a lambda beforehand though)
1179,2019-03-13T22:00:26.591100,Hiroko,are you sure the method you’re using is a post?
1179,2019-03-13T22:00:35.591400,Hiroko,and not a patch/put?
1179,2019-03-13T22:03:47.593000,Ursula,"Yes, I'm going through a course and this code works for the instructors and other students. Although I am getting the 403 error when I call the GET request to get an IAM user permission to upload to the bucket"
1179,2019-03-13T22:04:45.593500,Nieves,403 is unauthorized so you prolly don't have the right perms or whatever.
1179,2019-03-13T22:05:04.594200,Nieves,"Also, which version of Python and the like is used in the course?"
1179,2019-03-13T22:06:20.594600,Hiroko,"&gt;&gt;&gt;Note: CloudFront caches the results of an HTTP 403 (Access Denied) error for up to 5 minutes. After you remove the deny statement from the bucket policy, you might need to run an invalidation on your distribution to remove the object from the cache."
1179,2019-03-13T22:06:53.595000,Hiroko,"wait, <@Joanne> what’s giving you a 403?"
1179,2019-03-13T22:07:42.595700,Ursula,When I try to request the IAM user's permissions who can upload to the bucket
1179,2019-03-13T22:08:28.596600,Ursula,And I did something wrong in my API so I am getting a 502 at the moment so it shouldn't be cached :sweat_smile:
1179,2019-03-13T22:08:59.597100,Ursula,"Also, the code is written in Node, but it doesn't focus too much on the code"
1179,2019-03-13T22:21:13.597600,Ursula,Fixed the 502! Now back to the 403 :facepalm:

Hello guys I know this topic is from kubernetes but just asking.... is there any cron job anyone wrote for running every 10mins and deleting the pods which are in ""Terminating stage""in all the namespaces in the cluster?help would be appreciated....struggling with shell script"
1181,2019-03-14T06:05:07.603400,Nieves,"Might be simple, but how do you return the value with enumerate() without the counter (0,1,2, etc.)?"
1181,2019-03-14T06:11:37.603700,Melynda,Just don't use enumerate? :smile:
1181,2019-03-14T06:12:30.604400,Melynda,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; [(idx, value) for idx, value in enumerate(['zero', 'one', 'two'])]

1181,2019-03-14T06:12:31.604600,Nieves,"Prolly, but I am lazy... this is very inconvenient since it returns: [0, 'value'] and etc."
1181,2019-03-14T06:12:38.605000,Nieves,Um... yeah I know
1181,2019-03-14T06:12:45.605400,Melynda,"Or you can do `for _, value in enumerate(…)`"
1181,2019-03-14T06:12:47.605600,Nieves,"I can do it manually, but it's more typing"
1181,2019-03-14T06:13:06.605800,Nieves,I just want the value... nvm
1181,2019-03-14T06:13:14.606200,Melynda,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; [value for _, value in enumerate(['zero', 'one', 'two'])]

1181,2019-03-14T06:13:52.607300,Melynda,But you're just going to make a new list which is identical to the input to enumerate… What are you actually trying to do?
1181,2019-03-14T06:14:00.607500,Nieves,Nothing really....
1181,2019-03-14T06:14:02.607700,Nieves,It's an experiment
1181,2019-03-14T06:14:18.608000,Nieves,I am not really a python programmer...
1181,2019-03-14T06:14:21.608200,Nieves,OOP is weird too
1181,2019-03-14T06:14:54.608600,Melynda,None of this is OOP though :smile:
1181,2019-03-14T06:15:18.609000,Nieves,"I know, but was stating an opinion"
1181,2019-03-14T06:15:31.609400,Nieves,I don’t like OOP nor Python
1181,2019-03-14T06:15:45.609900,Nieves,I actually don’t like many ‘modern’ languages
1181,2019-03-14T06:17:02.610200,Melynda,None of this is OOP though :smile:
1181,2019-03-14T06:17:34.610400,Nieves,Again... I know
1181,2019-03-14T06:17:49.610800,Nieves,I just said I don’t like either...
1181,2019-03-14T06:17:50.611000,Nieves,Goodness
1181,2019-03-14T06:18:05.611400,Melynda,"Didn't mean to repeat, my 'net connection is flaky as fuck so it sent twice"
1181,2019-03-14T06:18:11.611600,Nieves,Lol
1181,2019-03-14T06:18:23.612300,Nieves,That is why I have 5G now
1181,2019-03-14T06:18:31.612800,Melynda,"If you don't like programming, OOP, or Python… why are you experimenting with it?"
1181,2019-03-14T06:18:39.613000,Nieves,Gotta spend that hard earned cash on something useful 
1181,2019-03-14T06:18:42.613200,Nieves,Lolol
1181,2019-03-14T06:19:17.614200,Nieves,Just because I don’t like a language or concept doesn’t mean I don’t like programming... of course I use whatever language is best for the job
1181,2019-03-14T06:19:37.614800,Nieves,In the workplace... it doesn’t matter what you like or use for that matter
1181,2019-03-14T06:19:49.615200,Nieves,"As long as it works and works efficiently, you get paid"
1181,2019-03-14T06:20:15.616200,Nieves,Aka I will learn any language that is needed
1181,2019-03-14T06:20:20.616400,Hiroko,And yet you do complain a lot.
1181,2019-03-14T06:20:35.617100,Nieves,Yes... I do. I have opinions.
1181,2019-03-14T06:20:51.617300,Nieves,Python is overhyped
1181,2019-03-14T06:21:05.617800,Nieves,"Most of the OGs I talk to, hate Python"

1181,2019-03-14T06:21:48.619700,Nieves,The guys that have been around a very long time some even during BBS era
1181,2019-03-14T06:22:04.620200,Nieves,ASM is my goal eventually for what I am going into
1181,2019-03-14T06:22:24.621100,Nieves,x86 specifically
1181,2019-03-14T06:22:29.621300,Hiroko,"Ah, making your own railroad tycoon?"
1181,2019-03-14T06:22:36.621600,Nieves,Lol
1181,2019-03-14T06:22:36.621700,Melynda,Hah! :smile:
1181,2019-03-14T06:23:15.622700,Nieves,No. Malware/exploit dev is best in like C or ASM... for Red Teaming of course.
1181,2019-03-14T06:23:51.623900,Nieves,Of course... most of the tools I deal with use Python or a scripting language so learning the language a bit allows me to modify tools to what I want them to do.
1181,2019-03-14T06:24:20.624800,Nieves,Not planning on being a malware/exploit dev for a while... I would be happy just being a pentester 
1181,2019-03-14T06:28:52.625000,Conrad,reminds me of when I was 14
1181,2019-03-14T06:29:04.625300,Conrad,not any of the programming expertise or anything
1181,2019-03-14T06:29:10.625500,Conrad,just the general attitude...
1181,2019-03-14T06:59:10.627700,Nieves,Heh. What attitude is that may I ask?
1181,2019-03-14T07:00:04.628100,Nieves,I am here because I know I am no good with Python since I don't use it _that_ much.
1181,2019-03-14T07:00:18.628500,Conrad,no offense intended. just the complaining bit lol
1181,2019-03-14T07:00:22.628800,Nieves,Meh...
1181,2019-03-14T07:00:27.629000,Nieves,I state my opinion
1181,2019-03-14T07:00:33.629300,Nieves,My apologies if it comes off as complaining
1181,2019-03-14T07:00:40.629500,Nieves,I am used to C and Perl...
1181,2019-03-14T07:00:48.629800,Nieves,"Aka things are a lot harder to implant, but you learn a lot"
1181,2019-03-14T07:01:08.630300,Nieves,The best languages survived for a reason
1181,2019-03-14T07:01:39.630800,Nieves,I am learning Py3 mainly because I know I will need it in my field...
1181,2019-03-14T07:02:00.631400,Nieves,I also got into arguments over the correct way to implant something as simple as FizzBuzz in Py
1181,2019-03-14T07:03:06.632900,Nieves,Most in my CS class and major can't comprehend the basics of C... I am noticing how Python doesn't teach the 'low level' concepts since if something breaks... the programmer has to fix it.
1181,2019-03-14T07:03:24.633800,Nieves,"Personally, Python is good if you understand the concepts that are needed in case something 'breaks'"

1183,2019-03-14T08:34:21.647200,Arturo,perfect!
1183,2019-03-14T08:34:29.647500,Arturo,sorry what does IIRC mean?
1183,2019-03-14T08:34:44.647800,Melynda,If I Remember/Recall Correctly. :slightly_smiling_face:
1183,2019-03-14T08:35:09.648300,Arturo,thanks :slightly_smiling_face: <@Dayna> :taco:
1183,2019-03-14T08:35:30.648600,Arturo,<@Melynda> :taco:
1183,2019-03-14T08:35:44.649000,Arturo,whoops sent someone else called Matt a taco!
1183,2019-03-14T08:36:01.649400,Melynda,"Hah, everyone loves a taco! :smile:"
1183,2019-03-14T08:36:24.649800,Arturo,can you explain why i did not need `readline`?
1183,2019-03-14T08:39:08.650600,Melynda,Calling `readline()` as you did will only read one line from the file.
1183,2019-03-14T08:39:42.651100,Melynda,The docs go into the usage of `for line in f` <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects>
1183,2019-03-14T08:40:58.652500,Arturo,"cool will do, now how to figure how to parse if a table occurs before the `--- end`"
1183,2019-03-14T08:41:18.652800,Melynda,"I've commented on your code: ```with open(filename) as fp:
    line = fp.readline()  # read one line from the file
    while line:  # Loop so long as line is truthy
        while line.strip():  # Loop so long as line.strip() returns a truthy value
              print(line)  # Print the unstripped line```"
1183,2019-03-14T08:41:50.653900,Melynda,You've two nested loops without ever reading any further data from the file.
1183,2019-03-14T08:41:59.654300,Arturo,"sorry I forgot to write in, I did have the `line = fp.readline()` within my loop"
1183,2019-03-14T08:42:07.654500,Melynda,Ah :slightly_smiling_face:
1183,2019-03-14T08:42:34.655000,Melynda,"Probably best to copy and paste rather than re-type, to avoid errors like that."
1183,2019-03-14T08:42:43.655200,Arturo,yup
1184,2019-03-14T09:03:49.655300,Cammie,"Hey Orf, just saw these messages. Sorry about that, had to drive home cause of a mini-blizzard"
1184,2019-03-14T09:04:10.655500,Cammie,"So you’re saying that the python 3 type hinting has essentially done awawy with function comments.

Is that a fair explanation?"
1184,2019-03-14T09:04:56.655700,Cammie,"Additionally, if I wanted to write some text describing the functions above, do I still just do something like

```
from typing import Hashable, Any

class HashTable:
    ""A horribly simple HashTable implementation.""
    def __getitem__(self, key: Hashable) -&gt; Any:
      """"""Some text about the function

       """"""
      raise NotImplementedError()

   def __setitem__(self, key: Hashable, value: Any):
      """"""Some text about the function

       """"""
      raise NotImplementedError()
```"
1184,2019-03-14T09:04:58.655900,Cammie,?
1185,2019-03-14T09:26:04.656800,Jonas,The type hints remove any need for comments about the types of the arguments 
1185,2019-03-14T09:26:19.657400,Jonas,"If the names of the arguments are self descriptive, no need either "
1185,2019-03-14T09:26:47.658400,Jonas,"Comments and docstrings are great, but overly verbose comments with redundant information hides important information"
1185,2019-03-14T09:27:35.659800,Jonas,"Everyone knows ‘__getitem__’ gets an item, no need to explain that. You should presume some prior knowledge of python when writing comments "
1185,2019-03-14T09:29:11.660000,Cammie,"<@Jonas> I’m with you in generally. Write verbose, easy to understand variable names and functions and bam less documentation. Like

&gt; Documentation is out of date the minute you finish writing it

That being said, I want to learn how to document my Python functions per the PEP standards. Do you have any advice on that?"
1185,2019-03-14T09:29:26.660400,Cammie,"I ended up writing:

```
class HashTable():
    """"""A horribly simple HashTable implementation.

    """"""
    def get(self, key): 
        """"""Fetches the value of the given previous set key.
        
        Args:
            key (int or str or float): The key of the value of interest.

            any or None: The value that belongs to this key or None if not found.

        """"""
        raise NotImplementedError
    
    def put(self, key, value):
        """"""Stores the given value, relating it to the given key.
        
        Args:
            key (int or str or float): The key of the value of interest.
            value (any): The value to store for this key.

        """"""
        raise NotImplementedError
```"
1185,2019-03-14T09:30:09.661100,Jonas,"Pretty much all of those comments are redundant, that’s the point "
1185,2019-03-14T09:30:52.662100,Jonas,"It’s obvious that ‘put’ puts a value, and it’s obvious what key and value are in this context "
1185,2019-03-14T09:41:28.662300,Cammie,I don’t think I’m being clear here. In this example its very redudant.
1185,2019-03-14T09:41:46.662500,Cammie,"I’m trying to use this example to learn the correct formatting so when I actually want to write some documentation, I can do so compliantly"
1185,2019-03-14T09:41:55.662700,Cammie,We can just punt on the whole thing
1185,2019-03-14T11:35:59.664100,Ursula,I FIXED IT!!!!! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
1185,2019-03-14T11:48:19.671100,Ursula,Thanks <@Hiroko> for helping me last night!
1186,2019-03-14T11:40:36.664300,Joette,"if you're looking for ""real"" looking test data, check out <https://pypi.org/project/Faker/> - and if you want to test exhaustively try <https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> (although you may have to work a little harder for stuff beyond regular data types)"
1186,2019-03-14T11:41:07.664700,Joette,I like using Hypothesis for testing forms b/c it'll throw stuff at your forms that you never thought of
1187,2019-03-14T11:44:33.667100,Bethany,I love hypothesis. Anybody know if you could make a strategy for a marshmallow schema?
1187,2019-03-14T11:45:39.668400,Bethany,you mean transcribe from audio to text ?
1187,2019-03-14T11:46:28.669500,Ursula,"When you say ""strategy"", could you elaborate?"
1187,2019-03-14T11:46:53.670000,Bethany,<https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data.html>
1187,2019-03-14T11:47:03.670300,Bethany,strategies are used to generate test values
1187,2019-03-14T11:47:26.670600,Bethany,"so a ""float"" strategy would generate [NaN, 0.0, inf, -1.0] and so on"
1187,2019-03-14T11:48:00.670900,Ursula,"Ohhhh ok, I thought when you said that you love hypothesis that it was referring to another post above that I missed and not a package :sweat_smile:"
1187,2019-03-14T11:48:51.671800,Bethany,yeah the post above mentioned the library and it reminded me :slightly_smiling_face:
1187,2019-03-14T11:49:00.672000,Jenniffer,"Yes. Though in Linguistics,we do not use the automated ones that type it for you. We prefer to type it ourselves since we have conventions and symbols to use that programs don't do (maybe in the future, I could come up with that)"
1187,2019-03-14T11:49:43.672800,Ursula,"Ah okay, hopefully you can make a strategy out of it then :thumbsup:"
1187,2019-03-14T11:50:11.673700,Bethany,So you have your typed notes and you want to convert to a different format?
1187,2019-03-14T11:50:33.674000,Jenniffer,Not exactly
1187,2019-03-14T11:50:41.674400,Jenniffer,:thinking_face:
1187,2019-03-14T11:50:55.674700,Bethany,"could you give an example of what your input is, and what you want to change it to?"
1187,2019-03-14T11:52:09.675300,Jenniffer,"Transcription examples (some of them seem to no come up)

Ail:    Goo:::d=

1187,2019-03-14T11:52:29.675800,Bethany,you can click the `+` next to the text input and it should format nicer
1187,2019-03-14T11:52:31.676000,Jenniffer,so basically those symbols convey meanin
1187,2019-03-14T11:52:35.676200,Jenniffer,right
1187,2019-03-14T11:52:37.676400,Jenniffer,gimme a sec
1187,2019-03-14T11:52:51.676500,Hiroko,anytime :slightly_smiling_face:
1187,2019-03-14T11:53:47.677200,Ursula,"Wait, hang on forgot the :taco: <@Hiroko>"
1187,2019-03-14T11:57:23.677600,Jenniffer,None
1187,2019-03-14T12:00:10.679800,Jenniffer,"ANd just like when coding, each line must have a line number (hard to make in word but no impossible). It be easier if I can create like a word processor or something similar just for audio transcription purposes. But cant find much info around and I recently started with Python"
1187,2019-03-14T12:00:13.679900,Bethany,kinda like this <https://github.com/olipratt/swagger-conformance>
1187,2019-03-14T12:01:09.680400,Bethany,very interesting
1187,2019-03-14T12:01:53.680700,Bethany,you want to make a software that makes writing these transcripts easier?
1187,2019-03-14T12:02:14.681100,Jenniffer,yes!
1187,2019-03-14T12:02:24.681300,Bethany,alright now i understand :slightly_smiling_face:
1187,2019-03-14T12:02:45.681800,Jenniffer,or easier for CONversation ANalysis lol
1187,2019-03-14T12:03:25.682500,Bethany,"so do the (0.5) mean pause of 0.5 seconds, like it's measured?"
1187,2019-03-14T12:04:07.683200,Bethany,"At any rate, I think this is a pretty hard thing to do"
1187,2019-03-14T12:04:59.683800,Jenniffer,yes
1187,2019-03-14T12:05:10.684200,Bethany,the pauses are the easiest part to automate
1187,2019-03-14T12:06:20.685500,Jenniffer,Remember that all I need is to make typing easier. The software shouldn't make it for me
1187,2019-03-14T12:06:54.686500,Bethany,oh well to be honest a text editor might be the simplest
1187,2019-03-14T12:06:56.686800,Carlo,basically a very specialized text editor then
1187,2019-03-14T12:06:56.686900,Jenniffer,"rather, the software should just give me the tools to type the symbols and pauses"
1187,2019-03-14T12:06:59.687000,Bethany,you just want line numbers?
1187,2019-03-14T12:07:32.687800,Jenniffer,kinda?
1187,2019-03-14T12:07:37.688300,Jenniffer,lol
1187,2019-03-14T12:07:54.689100,Bethany,do they get more complicated than `:::` and `(0.5)`? Cuz just typing those is probably the easiest
1187,2019-03-14T12:07:54.689200,Carlo,"<@Jenniffer> IMHO you'd be better off with custom snippets and basically any decent text/code editor, no?"
1187,2019-03-14T12:09:26.690600,Carlo,"there probably are ways to setup emmet-like expansion, like 5*: expanding to ::::: but Im not sure how quicker/easier you could realistically make it :confused:"
1187,2019-03-14T12:10:56.691100,Jenniffer,<@Bethany> This are pretty much the symbols
1187,2019-03-14T12:11:28.691800,Jenniffer,"<@Carlo> not sure, that could help though"
1187,2019-03-14T12:12:24.692900,Bethany,perhaps you could create a simple shorthand for the other symbols like `=&gt;` and `-&gt;` or something
1187,2019-03-14T12:12:24.693000,Carlo,pretty sure snippets would be doable for most of these...
1187,2019-03-14T12:12:32.693200,Jenniffer,I was trying to figure it out with a GUI but still
1187,2019-03-14T12:12:56.694000,Bethany,then find and replace
1187,2019-03-14T12:13:02.694200,Jenniffer,"Nah, I can change the symbols of a widely use system"
1187,2019-03-14T12:13:10.694500,Carlo,"with the amount of stuff youd have to cram in there though, would a GUI really make this easier?"
1187,2019-03-14T12:13:21.694800,Jenniffer,^ good pint
1187,2019-03-14T12:13:37.695200,Jenniffer,There is a transcription program I know in Linguistics
1187,2019-03-14T12:14:01.695900,Jenniffer,but I cant even open it in my computer since it old and wont even run on my mac
1187,2019-03-14T12:14:16.696300,Jenniffer,plus it's written in c++ and no idea about that
1187,2019-03-14T12:14:31.696600,Hiroko,seems like keyboard macros would be the best to do here
1187,2019-03-14T12:14:36.696800,Hiroko,or shortcuts
1187,2019-03-14T12:14:50.697100,Hiroko,"that way, you could use it with a regular text editor"
1187,2019-03-14T12:15:24.697600,Bethany,"yeah I think that's the best, it might be slow for a day or so but I bet you'll be super fast in no time"
1187,2019-03-14T12:18:00.698900,Jenniffer,I'll try a specialized text editor plus this is a personal project. It might or might not work
1187,2019-03-14T12:18:27.699200,Jenniffer,"Awesome, thank you guys!"
1187,2019-03-14T12:20:10.700000,Bethany,"yeah unfortunately the only thing I can think of to make this easier is to automate it, which would probably take a specialized neural net"
1187,2019-03-14T12:21:27.700100,Joette,"the only strategy creation I've done myself has been with composite strategies, but my short answer (er, guess) would be ""why not?"""
1187,2019-03-14T12:21:43.700400,Jenniffer,neural net?
1187,2019-03-14T12:21:56.700500,Bethany,"yeah there's no reason it can't be done, was just hoping somebody did it already :stuck_out_tongue:"
1187,2019-03-14T12:22:41.700700,Joette,"ah, nope! well, not I at least"

1188,2019-03-14T11:45:11.667700,Jenniffer,Hey guys! Hope you all are doing good. I am kinda new with Python and I am trying to read about how to create a transcription software (where I can automate certain things and export the transcription to word or any kind of word processor). Any ideas on where should I start?
1189,2019-03-14T13:16:38.702300,Otelia,"Struggle town, I'm unsure why python doesn't like ""if"" statements and ""return"" part of the function. help"
1189,2019-03-14T13:20:03.702600,Carina,Looks like you need an extra tab there (at the same level of indentation as your `assert` statements)
1189,2019-03-14T13:20:59.702800,Carina,"Also, it doesn’t really make sense to try and return from a python shell. That `return` should be inside the scope of your function (i.e. tabbed over)"
1189,2019-03-14T13:22:12.703000,Otelia,"right, so it's the indentation?"
1189,2019-03-14T13:22:49.703200,Otelia,what would you suggest I return it from?
1189,2019-03-14T13:23:09.703400,Carina,I guess it would help to know more about what you’re trying to do? Where does `choice` get its value?
1189,2019-03-14T13:23:18.703700,Lourie,None
1189,2019-03-14T13:23:20.704100,Lourie,Any idea how to solve this?
1189,2019-03-14T13:23:21.704200,Melynda,Looks to me like you are supposed to write a function called `choice_to_number`?

1190,2019-03-14T14:07:02.715200,Otelia,could you simply explain why the other code wasn't working?
1190,2019-03-14T14:07:09.715400,Otelia,if that's possible to articulate
1190,2019-03-14T14:11:13.715800,Carina,"I’ll try my best! All of the issues you were running into were syntax errors. It would likely be a good idea to check out the tutorial on the official docs site: <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html> — The specific syntax errors you had were: 1. Invalid/inconsistent tabs; Python uses tabs to denote blocks of code (effectively “scope”), whereas other languages use things like curly braces (`{` and `}`) to denote blocks of code. 2. The `assert` keyword has a specific invocation pattern. You need an expression to assert, and more generally `assert`ing an object will _evaluate_ your expression in an attempt to confirm that it is “Truthy” (i.e. using `bool(expression)` will return `True`), otherwise it will raise an `AssertionError`."
1190,2019-03-14T14:12:51.716000,Carina,"In your case specifically, you’re using the python shell, which is an interactive program where you type code directly into the interpreter. It’s still a python interpreter and still requires valid python syntax, so tabs are still a requirement. The tricky thing about the python shell is that it’s not really practical to build any significant/major behavior through the interactive interpreter, which is why I suggested putting your code in a file instead and running it using the `python my_tests.py` command."
1190,2019-03-14T14:15:52.716200,Carina,"Further, the `if __name__ == '__main__': test_all()` line is what tells python what code to run. This is more or less standard boiler plate for python applications/code, it’s somewhat analogous to other language “main” functions. For example, in java you’d use `public static void main(String[] args)`, in C it’s `int main()`, etc. etc."
1190,2019-03-14T14:19:01.716400,Carina,"I hope that’s clear, but definitely let me know if I can clarify this further."

1203,2019-03-15T15:14:10.769800,Lynelle,adding a vertex to an adjacency matrix is quoted at O(v^2) - if python uses a list of lists - wouldn't it be just O(v) ?
1203,2019-03-15T15:16:06.772200,Clemmie,For a list of list you need a nested loop - assuming an n x n size a nested loop is O(n^2)
1203,2019-03-15T15:20:02.774700,Bethany,what is the structure used for the adjacency matrix? Sparse matrix format like CSR style?
1203,2019-03-15T15:20:14.774900,Bethany,2D array?
1203,2019-03-15T15:20:15.775000,Lynelle,None

1203,2019-03-15T15:20:28.775700,Lynelle,I think it's still O(v) - you don't need a nested loop
1203,2019-03-15T15:20:39.776100,Clemmie,How are you iterating through the rows?
1203,2019-03-15T15:20:44.776400,Clemmie,that is the first loop
1203,2019-03-15T15:20:45.776600,Bethany,"well if you're adding a connection to an existing node, it should be constant time"
1203,2019-03-15T15:20:50.776800,Clemmie,then each row is a loop
1203,2019-03-15T15:21:08.777300,Bethany,adding a new node would require reallocating the whole thing more than likely
1203,2019-03-15T15:21:10.777400,Lynelle,"yes, adding/removing an edge is O(1)"
1203,2019-03-15T15:21:49.778300,Bethany,"generally adjacency matrix if it's large would be represented in sparse form, which is usually more of a dict of 1d arrays"
1203,2019-03-15T15:22:15.778800,Bethany,"or rather, two 1d arrays i think"
1203,2019-03-15T15:22:53.779100,Lynelle,pseudocode would be like
1203,2019-03-15T15:23:12.779600,Lynelle,`for r in rows: r.append(0)`
1203,2019-03-15T15:23:22.780000,Bethany,"so you could imagine adding a new vertex would be closer to allocate(v) and append(v), where the append is amortized constant"
1203,2019-03-15T15:23:25.780100,Lynelle,then
1203,2019-03-15T15:23:48.780400,Lynelle,"`list.append([0,0,0,1,0])`"
1203,2019-03-15T15:25:26.781500,Clemmie,where did you get list?
1203,2019-03-15T15:25:47.781700,Lynelle,it's just the entire list
1203,2019-03-15T15:26:06.782200,Lynelle,first step is adding a 0 or 1 to the end of each row
1203,2019-03-15T15:26:22.782500,Lynelle,second step is appending a list - basically the last row of the 2d array
1203,2019-03-15T15:26:44.782700,Clemmie,Did you see this discussion on Stack Exchange - <https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/297730/why-adding-a-vertex-in-a-graph-represented-using-an-adjacency-matrix-takes-ov>
1203,2019-03-15T15:27:07.783100,Lynelle,yep
1203,2019-03-15T15:27:18.783300,Lynelle,there's another SO thread that says it's implementation dependent
1203,2019-03-15T15:27:45.783500,Lynelle,"in a 2d array list of lists in python, we don't have to re-allocate the entire thing"
1203,2019-03-15T15:27:48.783700,Clemmie,"Right - that looks like the canonical algorithm is v^2, but fairly simple to do better"
1203,2019-03-15T15:27:50.784000,Bethany,yeah depending on growth schemes and memory allocators its different
1203,2019-03-15T15:28:14.784400,Lynelle,thanks guys!
1203,2019-03-15T15:28:21.784600,Bethany,are your edges directed?
1203,2019-03-15T15:28:54.784800,Lynelle,"in that green picture i posted - I guess they would be - 0 points to 1, and 1 points to 0"
1203,2019-03-15T15:30:11.785000,Bethany,So it's symmetric matrix if that's always the case
1203,2019-03-15T15:30:21.785200,Bethany,Or undirected
1203,2019-03-15T15:32:58.785400,Lynelle,I could see using a dict of 1d arrays
1203,2019-03-15T15:33:04.785600,Lynelle,kind of like an adjacency list
1203,2019-03-15T15:37:22.785800,Bethany,"Also, if you know how many nodes exist ahead of time, or even a guess you can always pre-allocate"

1204,2019-03-15T15:54:57.790600,Jonas,you can’t override a __hash__ method of an existing type
1204,2019-03-15T15:55:09.790800,Jonas,"for example, you can’t modify the `__hash__` of a tuple or a string"
1204,2019-03-15T15:55:35.791000,Jonas,"you _can_ with monkey patching only for pure-python objects (i.e not builtins), but it’s hard because it’s not something you really need or want to do"
1204,2019-03-15T15:56:03.791300,Cammie,Okay. Makes sense. I’ll try that extension method you’ve shown. Thank you

1210,2019-03-16T08:42:21.824000,Chuck,"Does anyone have any thoughts where I would start if I want to compare two near identical images for things like differences in specific colors? Use case is: in Australia our weather bureau publishes near-real-time weather radar images that represent storm activity as pixels overlaid on a map. Severe storm cells are represented with black pixels (decreasing down there to brown, red, orange, yellow, green blue etc). Black storm cells often represent hail storms. So, I would like to capture the most recent image (this part is easy), compare it against a 'clear weather' radar image, and perform some sort of activity if specifically the count of black pixels is higher in the current version of the image. I've never done image processing previously, so I'm wondering if anyone can point me to libraries, methods etc."

1215,2019-03-16T23:00:04.849200,Sasha,"It looks like you want to loop over `data['search']['wp']['features']`, and for each feature, loop over `feature['phoneNumbers']`. However, it's not necessarily clear from this example whether that will always work, or if there are other places phone numbers could show up in `'geo'` or `'yp'`, etc."
1215,2019-03-16T23:02:09.850100,Sasha,"I'd also be wary of assuming that every feature has a phone number associated with it, so you probably want a lot of error-checking."
1215,2019-03-16T23:03:25.850500,Conchita,That worked! Thanks <@Sasha> here's a :taco:
1215,2019-03-16T23:44:27.854100,Sasha,"Good question. I'm not aware of one, unfortunately. The usual practice would be either to have an explicit alphabet string constant to iterate through, or to construct the values from `range()` integers using `ord()` and `chr()`."
1215,2019-03-17T00:06:20.856900,Rob,"Per your input, I tried this and it appears to work:

1215,2019-03-17T00:09:10.858500,Sasha,"Great! For ease of readability, you can also do `range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1)` if you want."

1217,2019-03-17T11:52:04.865100,Sasha,"The easiest method I can think of is to start from the K+1 position (if there is one), then iterate backwards until you hit a space (or the beginning of the string), and truncate there."

1217,2019-03-17T12:27:40.872900,Sasha,"Good point. I was wondering whether the input is allowed to have leading or trailing spaces. The problem statement is ambiguous there, but maybe some of the examples would have shown that."

1220,2019-03-17T18:52:13.893100,Marth,"Kinda a ""high level"" question (so not sure if this is the right channel).  I've been spending a fair amount of time digging into Pandas (and I really enjoy it!).  Both tutorials as well as using it to automate some internal reporting.  I'm wondering if I might start to suffer ""when all you have is a hammer...everything looks like a nail"" mentality.  Basically, using pandas when a simple list or dictionary might work better.  At the end of the day, I suppose as long as it works ""right"" there's not a huge problem with using pandas (except perhaps some performance issues? but for what I generally do, this isn't a major concern).  Anyone have any thoughts regarding if there is a good way to know (or questions I should be asking myself) to identify 'X' as well suited to Pandas and 'Y' better served by a dictionary, list or other 'internal' data data structures?  Thanks!"
1221,2019-03-17T18:58:57.894900,Sasha,"I'm not an expert, but I'd say that Pandas is a good tool for multidimensional data (rows and columns, or more), whereas native Python data structures are nicely suited for one-dimensional data (lists, key-and-value, etc.)."
1221,2019-03-17T18:59:48.895400,Hiroko,"also, pandas is pretty heavyweight to install"
1221,2019-03-17T19:00:20.896000,Hiroko,"since it relies on numpy, IIRC"
1221,2019-03-17T19:01:11.897000,Hiroko,"would also suggest that knowing how things work behind the code is invaluable too, so if/when the case comes, you can know when you should do your own thing vs bring in the entire lib dependency stack when its just used in a couple small things"

1222,2019-03-18T01:18:44.903000,Sasha,"Gotcha. You may need to implement your own color-space conversion on a pixel-by-pixel basis instead of relying on OpenCV for that. Alternately, can you perform the conversion on the original square-pixel image first before the hex step?"
1222,2019-03-18T01:20:05.903700,Sasha,"In general, I would not expect things to ""just work"" between OpenCV and the hex-image libraries."
1222,2019-03-18T01:24:52.903800,Josef,what do you mean by performing the original sqaure-pixel image first?
1222,2019-03-18T01:26:47.904000,Sasha,"Well, you appear to be calling `cvtColor()` to convert the image to grayscale. Can you do that on the original JPEG instead?"
1222,2019-03-18T01:29:00.904200,Josef,"yes of course, so you mean to say I perform OpenCV processing first before converting the image to hexagonal pixel? Doesn't it change the main goal of hexagonal image processing where we convert image to hex then do some image processing after?"
1222,2019-03-18T01:31:14.904400,Sasha,"Depends on what your goal is, I guess. But the main point is that you probably shouldn't expect OpenCV to operate on hexagonal images, so you may have to implement your own image processing."
1222,2019-03-18T01:33:15.904600,Josef,"How can I make a function where I can Apply a 2DFilter on an image? Can I do that ? please help.

1222,2019-03-18T01:43:39.904800,Sasha,"No idea, I'm afraid. You know a lot more about hexagonal images than I do. It's not at all obvious how to generalize 2D filters to hex pixels since the axes are no longer orthogonal. Sounds like some math may be necessary to figure that out."

And in `char_dic` you're using dictionary comprehension, so it's valid too, but it has slightly different syntax. But I recommend you to read about comprehensions in general. It's a very powerful tool that save tons of time. And if you're ready for it, then generators as well."

1225,2019-03-18T05:08:53.919200,Yaeko,<@Tanja> Try to not use `global` (which will pop up if you google for variable scoping). It's usually regarded as bad practice and usually allows for other errors to occur.

typing ""jupyter notebook"" at command prompt simply returns me to the command prompt with no message, instead of launching the notebook server

The yolo plugin can also be configured to store a record of whatever it detected in a DB. You could probably use it to do what you want. I'm not sure how your whole system ties together, so it might not be worth it though"
1229,2019-03-18T13:29:13.972600,Granville,"all, I have a programming approach question may be specific to Python. When parsing strings containing text and delimiters, is it much better to parse syntax on-the-spot as you're iterating through each word/delimiter or pull out what's marked by delimiters, parse, then reinsert back into the marked placeholders? I guess it's more of a style question but I'm trying to see whether certain styles or approaches are favored over others when working with communities of programmers."
1229,2019-03-18T13:34:09.974700,Granville,that's what I was thinking. I'm still trying to determine how to best approach that as the delimiters can vary from a set of enclosed brackets to single colons
1229,2019-03-18T13:36:08.976600,Sasha,"If the delimiters are cleanly indicated, I tend to `split()` first and tackle each piece second. The exception is when you have issues like ""oh, no, that comma is actually within quotes, so it's not a delimiter"", where you need to parse the contents as you go just to understand how to split things."

1240,2019-03-19T07:54:08.021300,Svetlana,"<@Hiroko> any idea,why this happening?"
1240,2019-03-19T07:54:31.022000,Hiroko,"column `e` doesn’t exist, apparently"
1240,2019-03-19T07:55:15.022600,Svetlana,what does this means?excel sheet obviouly have that

1240,2019-03-19T08:10:47.028700,Hiroko,"makes sense, especialy if they’re keys in a dict"

1246,2019-03-19T12:25:30.054600,Rhona,im not sure. but i will look into your suggestion and see if it works. Also needed to take some fundamental training as it pretty complicated to understand
1246,2019-03-19T12:25:33.054700,Genesis,"<@Rhona> go to rds -&gt; your instance -&gt; connectivity and security tab, look for ""VPC security groups"""

1254,2019-03-20T04:42:41.095200,Jamey,It is a file used to store values that could be set using `export` e.g. (in this case) `export FOLDER=home` in the terminal
1254,2019-03-20T04:48:50.099400,Russ,I don't think using directory name as a string in an `.env` file is something bad. I guess you'll be using it later with something like `Path.joinpath(os.environ.get('FOLDER'))` or `os.path.join(...)` then no need to worry about slashes (either way you might want to use `os.sep` for something specific).
1254,2019-03-20T04:54:42.099900,Jamey,<@Russ> thanks. Will do :taco:

This is the instructions from the e-signature providers - <https://esignatures.io/docs/api#embedded-signing>
```
The sign page can be embedded into an iframe. Steps:

Create a contract with POST#contracts, and specify embedded=yes
The response json will include a data:contract:signers:embedded_url for every signer
In the iframe html code, replace the EMBEDDED_URL with the embedded_url for each signer respectively
Optional:

Specify the redirect_url when creating a contract, so the signers will be redirected to that given page. Please note that the redirect_url will only be loaded within the iframe.```"

I want to identify a niche for tweets by putting 10 tweets in one word count, and then comparing it with a file that holds keywords.
So let's say a user posts a sentence like `Want to the gym today and I've never had such sore muscles!` , i want to match this with one big file that holds keywords to multiple niches.

```Fitness { gym, muscle, muscles, soremuscle,gymrat}
fashion {clothing,legging,hoodie} 
niche {keyword1,keyword2,keyword3} 
```

So I want to analyze my text, count the amount of keywords that return and then say: Fitness niche is most counted, followed by fashion...

Does anyone know how I would best approach it? I'm no expert in python (yet :stuck_out_tongue: ) and I have no idea how to best tackle this"

1262,2019-03-20T11:55:09.143800,Bethany,<@Lucius> this problem is called 'categorization' or 'classification'
1262,2019-03-20T11:55:11.143900,Shawana,"so you had to use lists of words for your categories. and you could iterate over every word in your sentence, or you build some comprehensions around that"

1264,2019-03-20T14:19:41.161000,Claudine,yea I'd just clone the repo to the server then point your apache+wsgi_mod at your repo
1264,2019-03-20T14:20:06.162600,Joette,by using release folders (including updated virtualenvs in each release folder) you can roll back to deployments
1264,2019-03-20T14:20:09.163000,Claudine,"you can `git pull` to update the repo, or hook up some sweet git hooks to do it automatically when your upstream is updated"
1264,2019-03-20T14:20:16.163300,Carlo,if you feel fancy you could even setup a quick webhook -&gt; git pull on your server down the line
1264,2019-03-20T14:20:19.163600,Carlo,but I wouldnt do much more
1264,2019-03-20T14:20:20.163700,Joette,with something like Fabric setting it up is close enough to trivial

1264,2019-03-20T14:22:10.167100,Claudine,in that case you could learn nginx :smile:
1264,2019-03-20T14:22:22.167700,Angila,funny you mention that…

1264,2019-03-20T14:22:59.169100,Carlo,I've used nginx as a reverse proxy in docker-compose setups and... thats pretty much it
1264,2019-03-20T14:23:00.169200,Angila,prior to posting here my plan was to use nginx as a reverse proxy to hit my app running on gunicorn
1264,2019-03-20T14:23:52.169700,Carlo,well you _could_ still do that even with the simple git based deploy
1264,2019-03-20T14:24:25.170300,Carlo,probably wont make a noticeable difference in your usecase though
1264,2019-03-20T14:25:13.171200,Angila,"i initially wanted to use git hooks, but our systems security folks objected. i believe because the repo is outside our network"
1264,2019-03-20T14:27:02.172700,Angila,i think apache and wsgi_mod is what I'm going to do. that way i won't be the only person here who can support it. i do love going on vacation. thanks again!

1266,2019-03-20T15:32:56.176300,Carmen,"<@Angila> Just to add another option to your list of ways to do deployment, if you're setting up the copy of code on the server as a git repo, you can add a git remote to your local repo and just push directly to that remote when you want to do a deploy."
1266,2019-03-20T15:34:01.177500,Carmen,"If you have a bunch of other things that need to happen when you do a deploy, definitely look into Fabric. But for just pushing out code updates, git push works just fine if your target is also a git repo."
1266,2019-03-20T15:38:10.179000,Angila,<@Carmen> That's an interesting idea about setting up the deployment server as a git remote. I like that. And I'm just taking a look at Fabric. This could get interesting. Thanks!
1266,2019-03-20T15:42:28.182400,Carmen,"Caveats include: That machine must be reachable from your local machine (otherwise git push won't be able to reach it), others will need to set up the same remote to be able to deploy (not a big deal if you have appropriate documentation), and you somewhat lose out on having the deployed code be a tagged branch (you can tag it, sure, but the remote repo has to be a checkout of a branch that you can push to, like master, not a checkout of a detached head like a tag gives you)."
1266,2019-03-20T15:42:40.182800,Carmen,There may be one or two other things that my brain isn't remembering offhand.
1266,2019-03-20T15:45:42.185500,Angila,"Those first two aren't a problem. And the lack of tagging isn't a deal breaker but it's good to be aware of. I really like that once I've set it up as a remote and others add it, they'd be able to push updates"

1278,2019-03-21T04:39:49.222700,Antoine,Is password lenght. It does range(size) so keeps adding random chars until “size”

one more question, what if we hit enter on empty when it ask How many characters in your password?

it should show 8 characters password by default!?"

I can't seem to use the first element of the list symbol[0] or convert it to a string for some reason.

Code is like this:

```
    for i, v in enumerate(data):
        if i == 0:
            s = 'symbol'
            v.insert(0, s)
            v = "","".join(v)
            print(v)
        elif i &gt; 0:
            #s = ''.join(symbol) 
            #s = str(symbol[0])
            #s = ''.join([str(x) for x in symbol])
            s = ''.join(map(str, symbol[0]))
            ##print(type(symbol))
            ##print(len(symbol))
            ##print(symbol[0])
            ##break
            #s = symbol[0]
            symbol = '""{}""'.format(s)
            v[0] = '""{}""'.format(v[0])
            v[0] = '{}'.format(v[0])
            v.insert(0, symbol)
            v = "","".join(v)
            print(v)
```"
1291,2019-03-22T00:18:18.283200,Stacy,"all the extra quotes are stemming from this line: `symbol = '""{}""'.format(s)` before i added argparse this worked fine."
1291,2019-03-22T00:20:12.283500,Stacy,"argparse line: `parser.add_argument('-s', '--symbol', nargs='+', help=""stock symbol"", required=True) `"

1291,2019-03-22T00:21:00.284600,Sasha,"I'm finding it a little difficult to follow your question. Can you show me what `symbol` prints as when returned by argparse, and what you want it to be instead?"
1291,2019-03-22T00:21:18.284800,Stacy,yep one sec
1291,2019-03-22T00:21:32.285100,Stacy,"it is difficult, i use awful variable names, sorry."
1291,2019-03-22T00:22:22.285300,Stacy,"```

1291,2019-03-22T00:22:49.285800,Stacy,"i want a line to look like this:

`""PVTL"",""2019-03-21 14:12:00"",21.0200,21.0200,21.0200,21.0200,621`"
1291,2019-03-22T00:23:25.286100,Stacy,"the output above is from:

```
            print(type(symbol))

            print(symbol[0])
```"
1291,2019-03-22T00:24:25.287300,Sasha,"So it looks like `symbol[0]` is what you want, and the `'""{}""'.format(symbol[0])` should work. Can you clarify how that broke?"
1291,2019-03-22T00:26:44.288300,Stacy,"```
for i, v in enumerate(data):

            v = "","".join(v)
            print(v)
```

The lines look like this, like it's adding an extra quote, or extra empty quotes:

Example lines:

```
"""""",""2019-03-21 14:15:00"",21.0250,21.0250,21.0250,21.0250,211

"""""",""2019-03-21 14:12:00"",21.0200,21.0200,21.0200,21.0200,621
```"
1291,2019-03-22T00:28:42.289600,Sasha,"So you seem to be reassigning the `symbol` variable in the line after the `elif`, which means that `symbol[0]` gets to become the quotation mark from `""PVTL""` on subsequent passes through the loop."
1291,2019-03-22T00:29:17.289900,Stacy,"oh, yeah, here's the top of the output:

```
symbol,timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume
""PVTL"",""2019-03-21 16:00:00"",21.4000,21.4100,21.3600,21.3900,53672
"""""",""2019-03-21 15:59:00"",21.3900,21.3950,21.3900,21.3950,26517
```"
1291,2019-03-22T00:29:32.290300,Sasha,So your main problem is variable naming.
1291,2019-03-22T00:33:46.290900,Sasha,"Sorry, was that clear enough to indicate how to fix things, or should I be more explicit?"
1291,2019-03-22T00:36:12.292500,Stacy,"ughhhh. i got it. so this is what I ended up with. so after fixing variable `s` it was the `#v.insert(0, symbol)` line breaking things.

```
            s = '""{}""'.format(symbol[0])
            v[0] = '""{}""'.format(v[0])
            v[0] = '{}'.format(v[0])
            #v.insert(0, symbol)
            v.insert(0, s)
            v = "","".join(v)
            print(v)
```

took me a minute after your response but that was the nudge I needed."

1291,2019-03-22T00:38:02.294200,Sasha,"Great! By the way, the `v[0] = '{}'.format(v[0])` line doesn't do anything in this case, since it's just re-formatting the value as itself."
1291,2019-03-22T00:39:18.295100,Stacy,"yep, absolutely right.  not sure what that's doing there. haha, only the first two columns need to be quoted in doubles just like this `""PVTL"",""2019-03-21 14:12:00"",21.0200,21.0200,21.0200,21.0200,621`.  thanks for catching that as well."

1295,2019-03-22T05:32:54.307700,Yaeko,"The loop thing is better in my opinion, since it allows for interrupting the loop with, for example KeyboardInterrupt"
1295,2019-03-22T05:33:45.308000,Yaeko,Or if you are running multi-threaded things and sets some flags for exiting it can do so in between loops instead of hanging there for 7 minutes.

But if set some signal to exit it gracefully, that would not work if it is sleeping."

the output should be `ID=Source.ID, CreatedAt=Source.CreatedAt, Note=Source.Note`. so i thought maybe do zip(columns, equal_signs, merge_columns) and then turn it into a string, maybe by joining the zipped columns "", "".join(zipped_lists), but that doesn't work. anyone a better solution?"
1298,2019-03-22T09:10:39.318400,Hiroko,"actually, zip returns a generator, each step is a three tuple with your example"
1298,2019-03-22T09:10:48.318700,Hiroko,so you need to join the tuples before making the list
1298,2019-03-22T09:10:56.319100,Hiroko,"you’re almost there, just need one step further"
1298,2019-03-22T09:11:03.319400,Hiroko,"```In [7]: list(zip(columns, equal_signs, merge_columns))
Out[7]:
[('ID', '=', 'Source.ID'),
 ('CreatedAt', '=', 'Source.CreatedAt'),
 ('Note', '=', 'Source.Note')]
```"
1298,2019-03-22T09:11:25.320000,Hiroko,note the list triggers an eval and exhaustion of the zip generator
1298,2019-03-22T09:12:48.321600,Ashley,"The equals sign list seems unnecessary, since it will always be the same for every column pair, but zip is a good first step either way"
1298,2019-03-22T09:14:58.324600,Ashley,"You want to give something `join` can use easily, but I think if you give it multiple tuples, it will not convert them to strings in the format you would like. So you should have another step after zipping to format them into something that will work well with join"
1298,2019-03-22T09:16:54.324800,Hiroko,"```In [9]: [f'{column[0]}={column[1]}' for column in zip(columns, merge_columns)]

1298,2019-03-22T09:17:03.325100,Hiroko,then you can join on that to create a string
1298,2019-03-22T09:20:15.326000,Juliana,This is all getting put into a dict with the teams as keys and the players as the values.
1298,2019-03-22T09:23:45.328400,Ashley,"<@Juliana> I think this would be a good area to practice OOP. You can make a Team class and a Player class. You can make instances for each team and player, and allow both the player to track what team they're on and the team to track the players on it"

1298,2019-03-22T09:31:04.330200,Ashley,I'm not sure you need to
1298,2019-03-22T09:31:17.330600,Ashley,How are the players supposed to be divided up?
1298,2019-03-22T09:31:56.332100,Ashley,"Is it to just grab the first 6 and put them on the first team, then grab the next 6 and put them in the next team, and so on?"
1298,2019-03-22T09:32:18.332500,Juliana,They are being sorted by experience in a separate function. And yes^
1298,2019-03-22T09:32:39.333400,Ashley,So you want one team with the 6 most experienced players?
1298,2019-03-22T09:33:23.334300,Juliana,"I need them placed like how they do fantasy football picks, if you know how that goes."

1298,2019-03-22T09:34:16.335200,Juliana,Thats more even teams id say
1298,2019-03-22T09:35:08.336100,Juliana,"or just putting them in one by one, i don't think it has to be that even. <@Ashley>"
1298,2019-03-22T09:51:44.338300,Ashley,"You're basically looking to add them in one by one, until you have no more.

1298,2019-03-22T09:53:15.339100,Juliana,there are 3 teams and 18 players. So what would that if statement need to look like? <@Ashley>
1298,2019-03-22T09:53:50.339600,Ashley,Why would you need an if statement?
1298,2019-03-22T09:56:26.339900,Juliana,"Because when i run  it like this, it adds it like this {team1 = [all players], team2 = [all players], team3 = [all players]}"
1298,2019-03-22T09:57:37.341300,Juliana,"this is the way i need it to use later on in the function: {team1 = [1,4,7], team2 = [2,5,8], team3 = [3,6,9,and so on]}"

1298,2019-03-22T10:11:57.351900,Carlo,right now you're iterating through every team and adding the player
1298,2019-03-22T10:12:03.352200,Clemmie,This is the situation that enumeration and mod logic are helpful

```for team, players in teams_with_player_rosters.items():
            players.append(player.get('name'))```"
1298,2019-03-22T10:15:44.357900,Carlo,that needs a bit of rethinking
1298,2019-03-22T10:16:26.358000,Juliana,None
1298,2019-03-22T10:16:34.358300,Juliana,None
1298,2019-03-22T10:17:27.359500,Juliana,Data is getting pulled from another file called constants.py so thats why i have to call on the 'name' <@Carlo> <@Clemmie>
1298,2019-03-22T10:17:37.359700,Carlo,that's alright
1298,2019-03-22T10:18:17.360600,Carlo,"as <@Clemmie> and I said, that function needs a bit of work, and he basically gave you the logic you have to implement"
1298,2019-03-22T10:18:42.361400,Clemmie,"<@Juliana> I want to rewrite it for you, but I also want you to understand the concepts we are focusing on"
1298,2019-03-22T10:18:43.361500,Carlo,"can't speak for him, but I won't write the code for you however, that part is where you learn"
1298,2019-03-22T10:19:24.362300,Clemmie,we hit on the same feeling at the same time
1298,2019-03-22T10:19:39.362800,Juliana,right i know thats why im paying alot for this class lol
1298,2019-03-22T10:20:09.363700,Clemmie,"How about this - I will write you the snippet, but I want you to type back what it is actually doing"
1298,2019-03-22T10:20:27.364300,Juliana,that works
1298,2019-03-22T10:20:38.364800,Clemmie,"ok, give me a minute"
1298,2019-03-22T10:21:05.365700,Juliana,Im just trying to think how that line of code would still call on the data i need
1298,2019-03-22T10:21:25.366200,Juliana,which is 'name'
1298,2019-03-22T10:22:12.366600,Dawn,"I'm using pyodbc with the latest sql server odbc driver. When trying to commit a merge statement in sql server with cursor.executemany and fast_execute=True, pyodbc throws a MemoryError. That's literally the only feedback it gives. The weird thing is that it's only trying to load 25 rows. Any ideas? Running the latest pyodbc and the latest sql driver.

Edit i found it works with fast_executemany = False..."
1298,2019-03-22T10:25:27.366800,Clemmie,This will work for any number of teams
1298,2019-03-22T10:27:26.367700,Juliana,ok hang on and let me explain it with comments
1298,2019-03-22T10:27:37.367800,Carlo,"```current_team = TEAMS[idx % len(TEAMS)]
teams_with_player_rosters[current_team].append(player.get('name'))```

would be how I'd split it, purely for readability, but maybe that's just me"
1298,2019-03-22T10:28:01.368000,Clemmie,"Yeah, I like one liners - but that is more readable"
1298,2019-03-22T10:28:35.368300,Clemmie,"I grew up on having to allocate everywhere, so If I can get away without a temp var I do"
1298,2019-03-22T10:28:46.368600,Carlo,hah makes sense!
1298,2019-03-22T10:29:17.368800,Juliana,So why are devs so intense about only coding few lines and not separating it all out like i had?
1298,2019-03-22T10:29:46.369000,Carlo,hmm because at some point you just get what you're reading and don't _need_ to split it out to understand
1298,2019-03-22T10:30:29.369300,Clemmie,"Some of it comes from historical language requirements, some about maintainability - it is all logically related to that operation, and I don’t need any of the values there for any other operations"
1298,2019-03-22T10:34:13.369900,Juliana,Do i need to return anything in that function?
1298,2019-03-22T10:34:45.370400,Clemmie,That is a very deep question
1298,2019-03-22T10:35:13.370800,Clemmie,For readability you should probably return teams_with_player_rosterss
1298,2019-03-22T10:35:59.371000,Clemmie,"Strictly speaking, you don’t have to, but that is because dicts are mutable and how python passes parameters - fairly advanced stuff"
1298,2019-03-22T10:36:42.371200,Juliana,everytime i run the file it has a syntax error at the end of line 2 inside the function
1298,2019-03-22T10:37:06.371400,Clemmie,that is surely possible - i typed it in textEdit. show me the error?
1298,2019-03-22T10:37:34.371700,Clemmie,nm - fixing it in the snippet
1298,2019-03-22T10:37:46.371900,Juliana,None
1298,2019-03-22T10:38:11.372300,Juliana,None
1298,2019-03-22T10:38:12.372700,Clemmie,"hmm, can’t edit snippets."
1298,2019-03-22T10:38:28.372900,Clemmie,add a `]` before `.append`
1298,2019-03-22T10:38:54.373100,Clemmie,and also your return statment at the end
1298,2019-03-22T10:41:03.373400,Juliana,So now when it runs it comes out to say 'None'
1298,2019-03-22T10:41:12.373600,Juliana,when printed
1298,2019-03-22T10:41:15.373800,Clemmie,did you add the return?
1298,2019-03-22T10:41:25.374000,Juliana,yeah
1298,2019-03-22T10:41:30.374200,Clemmie,show please
1298,2019-03-22T10:41:40.374400,Juliana,oh wait
1298,2019-03-22T10:42:32.374600,Juliana,So now it is duplicating the 6 in each team
1298,2019-03-22T10:43:14.374800,Clemmie,"you are right, I didn’t think the whole thing through completely - one sec"
1298,2019-03-22T10:45:47.375000,Clemmie,Can you show the output
1298,2019-03-22T10:46:13.375400,Jena,"what is the best way to generate list like [[0, 30], [30, 60], [60, 90], [90, 120], [120, 150], [150, 180], [180, 210], [210, 240], [240, 270], [270, 300], [300, 330], [330, 360]] ? incremental of 30 ... in pyspark"
1298,2019-03-22T10:46:19.375500,Juliana,"` {'Panthers': ['Karl Saygan', 'Les Clay', 'Herschel Krustofski', 'Matt Gill', 'Joe Kavalier', 'Eva Gordon', 'Karl Saygan', 'Les Clay', 'Herschel Krustofski', 'Matt Gill', 'Joe Kavalier', 'Eva Gordon'], 'Bandits': ['Bill Bon', 'Suzane Greenberg', 'Joe Smith', 'Sammy Adams', 'Sal Dali', 'Ben Finkelstein', 'Bill Bon', 'Suzane Greenberg', 'Joe Smith', 'Sammy Adams', 'Sal Dali', 'Ben Finkelstein'], 'Warriors': ['Phillip Helm', 'Jill Tanner', 'Diego Soto', 'Chloe Alaska', 'Arnold Willis', 'Kimmy Stein', 'Phillip Helm', 'Jill Tanner', 'Diego Soto', 'Chloe Alaska', 'Arnold Willis', 'Kimmy Stein']} `"
1298,2019-03-22T10:47:08.375700,Clemmie,"oh, ok, so the teams are broken down correctly, just duplicated."
1298,2019-03-22T10:47:37.375900,Juliana,right <@Clemmie>
1298,2019-03-22T10:47:45.376100,Clemmie,Can you add a `print(len(sorted_players))` at the beginning of the method
1298,2019-03-22T10:48:26.376300,Juliana,18
1298,2019-03-22T10:48:31.376500,Clemmie,never mind - I see what is happening
1298,2019-03-22T10:48:37.376700,Clemmie,I think
1298,2019-03-22T10:49:20.376900,Clemmie,"are you still calling `even_teams` twice in `main` (once naked, and once inside a `print` statement)?"
1298,2019-03-22T10:50:30.377100,Juliana,None
1298,2019-03-22T10:51:27.377900,Juliana,hmmm
1298,2019-03-22T10:51:44.378100,Clemmie,"Yeah, so you need to be careful calling methods multiple times. dicts are mutable, and like I said earlier son’t _have_ to be returned, so you are adding players to the rosters twice, once with each method call"
1298,2019-03-22T10:52:19.378300,Clemmie,you need to capture the return of the method call the first time in a var (`teams_with_player_rosters` can be reused) and print that
1298,2019-03-22T10:56:03.378500,Clemmie,Still with me?
1298,2019-03-22T10:56:21.378700,Juliana,nope haha im trying to figure it out
1298,2019-03-22T10:56:26.378900,Clemmie,k
1298,2019-03-22T10:57:03.379100,Clemmie,"Understanding it, or getting it to work?"
1298,2019-03-22T10:57:14.379300,Juliana,both
1298,2019-03-22T10:57:41.379500,Juliana,like what part are you looking at when saying that in the dunder main?
1298,2019-03-22T10:58:22.379800,Clemmie,in snippet that you posted you call `even_teams()` in lines 97 and 100
1298,2019-03-22T10:58:37.380000,Clemmie,that causes the rosters to be populated twice
1298,2019-03-22T10:59:07.380200,Clemmie,"but you are appending to lists, so it basically just duplicates the roster"
1298,2019-03-22T11:00:04.380400,Clemmie,"if instead you make line 97 do `teams_with_player_rosters = even_teams(teams_with_player_rosters, sorted_players)` then line 100 can be `print(teams_with_player_rosters)` and the duplication should go away"
1298,2019-03-22T11:02:04.380600,Juliana,I think you are not refering to the right line numbers so im posting the full app. so i need to change line 90 to that teams = and the line 91 i need to print <@Clemmie>
1298,2019-03-22T11:03:18.381000,Clemmie,"line numbers changed from what you posted before, but yes, 90 and 91"
1298,2019-03-22T11:03:39.381200,Juliana,what about line 89?
1298,2019-03-22T11:04:37.381400,Juliana,well it worked!
1298,2019-03-22T11:05:01.381600,Clemmie,"it is fine. You could do away with it by changing line 90 to `teams_with_player_rosters = even_teams(creating_teams_open_list()
, sorted_players)1 if you wanted"
1298,2019-03-22T11:05:04.381800,Juliana,hang on one sec let me digest this and explain in english what is going on
1298,2019-03-22T11:05:09.382000,Clemmie,Great
1298,2019-03-22T11:05:35.382300,Clemmie,exactly - don’t worry about the stuff in `main` just tell what `even_teams` is doing
1298,2019-03-22T11:12:35.385800,Melynda,"I don't know what pyspark is yet (Googling next), but you can do this in plain Python easily: ```&gt;&gt;&gt; [[x, x + 30] for x in range(0, 360, 30)]
[[0, 30], [30, 60], [60, 90], [90, 120], [120, 150], [150, 180], [180, 210], [210, 240], [240, 270], [270, 300], [300, 330], [330, 360]]```"
1298,2019-03-22T11:14:16.386900,Juliana,"Ok so <@Clemmie>, line 62 is taking the ` sorted_players ` from a previous function and is parsing through that list of ` sorted_players ` with ` enumerate() ` after that it is then assigning those players with a for loop into teams with open lists from ` teams_with_player_rosters `. It takes the number of teams and `appends ` the players name by grabbing it using the `get()` function."
1298,2019-03-22T11:14:49.387700,Clemmie,and how does it determine which team to put a player on?
1298,2019-03-22T11:15:15.388100,Juliana,Although the one thing i feel like im not understanding completely is the use of the ` idx `
1298,2019-03-22T11:15:42.388900,Juliana,I feel like i would be using that to answer the question but im not sure how that part fits in
1298,2019-03-22T11:16:28.389800,Clemmie,"so `enumerate(&lt;list&gt;)` spits out a tuple for each iteration - the enumeration (position in the list) and the element from the list. so `idx` is the current position in the list (0,1,2,3,4….)"
1298,2019-03-22T11:21:57.390100,Mora,"If this helps, `idx` is an abbreviation of “index”"
1298,2019-03-22T11:22:11.390300,Clemmie,^
1298,2019-03-22T11:22:18.390500,Juliana,i know that lol but thanks
1298,2019-03-22T11:25:59.391400,Juliana,i feel like all python is is ` if ` and ` for loops ` to get things you need to happen
1298,2019-03-22T11:26:17.391700,Juliana,Is that a fair assumption?
1298,2019-03-22T11:27:24.392400,Merilyn,<@Juliana>....naaah bruh

1298,2019-03-22T11:38:19.395500,Juliana,OOHHHH That part where it has the '%' it is a modulo operator and it is dealing out the players into the teams in the second line <@Clemmie>
1298,2019-03-22T11:38:45.395800,Juliana,by using the number of teams that can change and it still work
1298,2019-03-22T11:38:45.396000,Clemmie,bingo

1298,2019-03-22T11:40:03.398300,Clemmie,So much more of python comes from structuring code and object relations

1298,2019-03-22T11:40:43.399900,Clemmie,"then you can get into mro, metaprogramming, dependency injection, monkey patching….."

1303,2019-03-22T12:54:31.412400,Clemmie,aka Levenshtein Distance
1303,2019-03-22T12:57:06.412800,Sasha,What kind of thing are A and B?
1303,2019-03-22T12:58:38.414200,Jolanda,"A and B have attributes like color, size, and shape so I would use these attributes to be able to predict how much % A and B are similar"
1303,2019-03-22T12:59:09.414800,Jolanda,<@Clemmie> Isn't Edit Distance
1303,2019-03-22T12:59:36.415400,Clemmie,Do you know for sure there is an algorithm to do what you want?
1303,2019-03-22T13:00:58.416900,Jolanda,"I read a post where a guy used ML to predict if a element is a nav or not, using a score"
1303,2019-03-22T13:01:29.417800,Ashley,Nav?
1303,2019-03-22T13:01:44.418200,Clemmie,They probably built an ML classifier - it generated the algorithm you are looking for
1303,2019-03-22T13:01:53.418500,Clemmie,with training sets
1303,2019-03-22T13:02:02.418800,Clemmie,and how they wanted the scoring mapping to look
1303,2019-03-22T13:09:55.420100,Letty,"“similarity metric” might be what you’re looking for (metric there is in the math jargon sense, roughly speaking a “distance formula” but with more rigor)"
1303,2019-03-22T13:10:59.421200,Letty,"but misthop is right, the “algorithm” is going to be an ML model. Not as scary as it sounds, you could probably follow a `sklearn` tutorial and build a random-forrest classifier quickly (granted, without understanding what’s going on under the hood)"

1304,2019-03-22T13:52:56.431300,Clemmie,"generally it won’t. i think pep8 has some suggestions, but overall it is opinion/preference"

1304,2019-03-22T13:53:31.432100,Joette,most people's preferences seem to be aesthetic
1304,2019-03-22T13:53:45.432700,Jonas,I would use black if it supported single quotes 
1304,2019-03-22T13:53:59.433200,Jonas,Double quotes are... urgh
1304,2019-03-22T13:54:04.433400,Joette,"I like `""` because I'm used to double quotes indicating strings and single quotes indicating individual characters"
1304,2019-03-22T13:56:01.434900,Sasha,"I tend to use single quotes for things that are variable/expression-ish, like dict keys, and double quotes for things that are string-ish, like text to be printed. Just personal style, though."
1304,2019-03-22T13:56:13.435200,Joette,"I actually like that, I just find it hard to stick to"
1304,2019-03-22T13:56:35.435600,Joette,especially coordinating other people to stick to it
1304,2019-03-22T14:01:36.437900,Jonas,It’s the pep8 way
1304,2019-03-22T14:02:09.439000,Jonas,So they should stick to it. It’s not hard 
1304,2019-03-22T14:04:05.440500,Marth,"coming into python I almost always used double quotes, I've noticed I've slowly started to use single quote more often.  For 2 (sorta related?) reasons... 1. aesthetic/looks 'cleaner' to me  2. Using pycharm/VS Code...since it auto adds the second quote (regardless of which I use) I find it easier to see how many quotes are already 'in place' or if I need to click between them to put my cursor there.  Though item 2 could definitely just me (and my eyes) getting older."

1304,2019-03-22T14:10:06.442400,Ashley,I use double quotes mostly because of having to deal with SQL queries where only single quotes are allowed for reasons
1304,2019-03-22T14:10:28.442700,Ashley,that way I didn't have to escape them

I didn't understand something about python's mock lib: I have a test that calls a method that instantiate a class object, I'd like to mock the object"

1309,2019-03-22T19:11:19.461500,Sasha,"Functions are objects in Python, so you can create a list of functions and use them in a loop, for instance."
1309,2019-03-22T19:18:34.462500,Berenice,~Or map them in a `dict` but I think it mostly depends on your use case.~

1309,2019-03-22T19:21:15.464800,Sasha,"```for i, value in enumerate(data):

1309,2019-03-22T20:19:23.470800,Angele,<@Sasha> How could this approach be adapted to variable arguments?

1309,2019-03-22T20:21:33.472300,Angele,But this is real messy
1309,2019-03-22T20:27:49.473500,Sasha,You could consider using the `*args` and `**kwargs` features to pass in multiple arguments from a list/dict. Alternately you could use `functools.partial()` to curry the arguments into your function object.

1327,2019-03-24T13:17:40.535600,Priscilla,"hmmm... `grep : The term 'grep' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable
program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and
try again.`"

1327,2019-03-24T13:23:14.536900,Rebeca,<@Priscilla> are you on windows? i’m guessing you are in windows since `grep` ships with all unix-like OSs

1327,2019-03-24T13:24:47.538900,Rebeca,"but, if the fancy windows “power shell” has those, then go for it."
1327,2019-03-24T13:25:54.540300,Priscilla,"thats apparently the exact command for windows, according to searching. I wonder if there is a way to install grep, or maybe its meant to be applied through cygwin"

1327,2019-03-24T13:48:38.552100,Jeanie,"has anyone used twine to create a pip package? mine uploaded fine and i was able to pip install, but when i import it i get “module not found”.. i’m in the same venv i used to install it and it shows up with pip list.."
1327,2019-03-24T13:49:47.553300,Sasha,"With a quick scan, it looks like the wunderlist API wants a JSON format in the POST body, rather than urlencoded parameters."
1327,2019-03-24T13:50:14.553600,Rebeca,"<@Jeanie> have used it passingly… one thing to check is whether the `module not found` error is not masking some other error inside your package that you created.
<@Sasha> nice catch!"
1327,2019-03-24T13:52:14.556100,Jackie,"<@Sasha> Yeah I picked that up a few minutes ago and added the following line to the hdr:
```'Content-Type': 'application/json',```"
1327,2019-03-24T13:52:52.556600,Jeanie,"all my functions are in “axl.py” which includes a class “AXL” of functions. if i create a “test.py” in the same folder i can do “from axl import AXL, instantiate it with “ucm = AXL(options here)” and use it fine with “ucm.myFunction(parameters)”"
1327,2019-03-24T13:56:09.558300,Jeanie,all of the examples on the pep website go over functions but not classes. didn’t know if there was something special you had to do
1327,2019-03-24T13:57:11.558600,Sasha,<@Jackie> That might not be sufficient... I'd look into using `json.dumps()` instead of `urlencode()` to create your POST data string.
1327,2019-03-24T13:57:33.559000,Jackie,"Tried that before, same result"
1327,2019-03-24T13:57:48.559400,Jackie,however let me try again now that I've corrected some syntax mistakes
1327,2019-03-24T13:58:44.560200,Sasha,"The doc example also has a literal `""json""` prefix string in the POST body... maybe that's required too?"
1327,2019-03-24T14:06:16.560900,Jackie,"Well some progress there, I'm not getting the Bad Request error but what I'm getting is not the response that I should be expecting"
1327,2019-03-24T14:06:39.561400,Jackie,"Let me look into that, and for now thank you all for your help"
1327,2019-03-24T14:18:16.561900,Jackie,"<@Sasha> ok smashing, that worked, thank you so much"
1327,2019-03-24T14:18:59.562800,Jackie,"while I have your attention just one last one. In the Wunderlist documentation they said that you can add a parameter called ""configuration"" but they have not explained what that is."
1327,2019-03-24T14:19:22.563600,Jackie,is that something generic or something wunderlist specific that they just forgot to document?
1327,2019-03-24T14:54:09.566600,Sasha,"<@Jackie> Yeah, I can't see any documentation about that, so my guess is they just have it as a hook for future expansion or something."
1327,2019-03-24T14:54:27.566800,Jackie,"ok, thanks"

1329,2019-03-24T14:49:10.565600,Mana,Guys I have to write a code to check if a number is prime or not using while loop. Your help will be appreciated :pray::skin-tone-5:
1329,2019-03-24T14:50:08.566000,Hiroko,What have you tried so far?
1329,2019-03-24T15:04:21.567100,Mana,@dd82 
1329,2019-03-24T15:06:22.568100,Sasha,"You're very close. Have a look at the placement of the `x += 1` statement. Right now it's inside the `if` block, so it only gets executed in the ""not prime"" case."
1329,2019-03-24T15:12:16.569600,Mana,I tried changing the placement but for everything number I input it returns “it’s not prime”
1329,2019-03-24T15:14:26.570100,Sasha,Maybe try printing out `x` so you can see what it thinks the number is divisible by.
1329,2019-03-24T15:15:35.570300,Mana,Sure
1329,2019-03-24T15:17:19.570400,Rodrick,"Sorry, by DM i meant doing <@Rodrick>"
1329,2019-03-24T15:22:15.571300,Mana,<@Sasha> still not getting it
1329,2019-03-24T15:22:53.571700,Stacy,doesn't appear your if/else statements line up with each other either.
1329,2019-03-24T15:23:00.571900,Hiroko,yep
1329,2019-03-24T15:23:06.572300,Rodrick,yea
1329,2019-03-24T15:23:08.572500,Hiroko,"also, please paste text, not images"
1329,2019-03-24T15:23:19.572900,Rodrick,its hard to edit them
1329,2019-03-24T15:23:22.573100,Sasha,"He's using a `while-else` construct, I think."
1329,2019-03-24T15:23:27.573300,Rodrick,Oh
1329,2019-03-24T15:23:45.573900,Rodrick,I think if you change the while-else to an if else it would work
1329,2019-03-24T15:23:50.574200,Hiroko,"so, I think you have two problems"
1329,2019-03-24T15:23:53.574400,Rodrick,try that <@Mana>
1329,2019-03-24T15:24:02.574700,Hiroko,"with your if block, you have the break inside it"
1329,2019-03-24T15:24:15.575200,Rodrick,oh yea
1329,2019-03-24T15:24:23.575500,Hiroko,move the `x += 1 line down and out of that if conditional
1329,2019-03-24T15:25:04.576300,Hiroko,"eg

```if n % x == 0:
    print(...)
x += 1
```"
1329,2019-03-24T15:25:31.576900,Hiroko,the `break` inside your `if` check is breaking out of the while loop
1329,2019-03-24T15:26:16.577600,Sasha,"The `break` is appropriate here, though, since you don't want to keep checking once you've found a factor."
1329,2019-03-24T15:26:45.578200,Rodrick,Did that help <@Mana>
1329,2019-03-24T15:27:04.578700,Rodrick,my suggestion or anyones?
1329,2019-03-24T15:27:25.579100,Hiroko,"<@Sasha> not really, IMO.  because the break inside there will stop the loop at the first check if the not a prime hits"
1329,2019-03-24T15:27:43.579600,Hiroko,"here, a while-else is not appropriate, I think"
1329,2019-03-24T15:27:54.580100,Hiroko,there should be two checks inside the loop
1329,2019-03-24T15:28:35.580900,Sasha,"Hmmm, I hate to disagree with you, <@Hiroko>, but I think you might be confused about the math. If you're prime-checking the number 20, you know it's not prime as soon as you see it's divisible by 2."
1329,2019-03-24T15:28:58.581200,Hiroko,:facepalm: you’re right
1329,2019-03-24T15:29:10.581600,Rodrick,haha
1329,2019-03-24T15:29:14.581800,Hiroko,I misread that to check what numbers from 0 to n are prime
1329,2019-03-24T15:29:22.582000,Hiroko,not an individual number
1329,2019-03-24T15:29:31.582300,Sasha,"Ah, gotcha."
1329,2019-03-24T15:30:38.583300,Rodrick,Get that Chris?

1331,2019-03-24T16:54:10.609400,Arcelia,"Yes, still works :slightly_smiling_face:"
1331,2019-03-24T16:56:53.611000,Lean,"Other nitpicks and ideas:
- Add an entrypoint function e.g `main()`
- Add `if __name__ = ""__main__"" ` to invoke this by CLI or as a lib.
- If using latest Python, consider using data classes for `MorningstarLocators`
- Consider modeling the `MorningstarParser` after the Page Object Model. Instead of `MorningstarParser`  , `MorningstarFundsPage`."

1335,2019-03-25T02:19:58.627300,Monnie,"Hi, can anyone tell me how safe are python libraries available on cond and pypi?"
1335,2019-03-25T02:25:23.628100,Sasha,"I'm not familiar with cond, but pypi ought to be pretty safe, especially for packages which have been around for a while."
1335,2019-03-25T02:30:28.628900,Sasha,"That said, it's not foolproof. There have been some malicious libraries on PyPI, and I don't think there's an audit process for new uploads."
1335,2019-03-25T02:36:40.629500,Monnie,"<@Sasha> i was talking about ""conda"""
1335,2019-03-25T02:41:20.630200,Sasha,"Gotcha. I presume that would be pretty safe too, but I don't actually know where conda pulls its packages from."
1335,2019-03-25T02:58:58.633900,Sasha,"When I was at Google, we needed to go through a somewhat involved process to get third-party libraries pulled into the company repo where they could be used in projects. That included licensing checks, security audits, etc. Typically they'd come directly from source instead of from package distributor sites."
1335,2019-03-25T02:59:40.634500,Sasha,That meant that versions available were often behind what was available externally.
1335,2019-03-25T03:00:32.635400,Sasha,And sometimes there would be some reinvention of the wheel where it was easier to rewrite simple libraries instead of get them approved.
1336,2019-03-25T02:55:16.631600,Monnie,"hmm, strange. i was wondering how big organizations are using python and managing this issue"
1336,2019-03-25T03:10:24.637000,Monnie,"I think then it would be better to use Anaconda repository instead, since its maintained by Continuum "

1337,2019-03-25T11:55:53.639600,Granville,I hope PyPI at least uses Bandit at minimum
1337,2019-03-25T12:03:17.640700,Clemmie,"PyPI is a clearinghouse - it takes anything that is a python package, no analysis done. They _do_ have a security policy and contact list, but that is for the security of PyPI, not packages on it"
1338,2019-03-25T12:22:33.641000,Granville,"ugh, that's a rude awakening"
1338,2019-03-25T12:25:18.641100,Hiroko,"same for npm, maven central, etc ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
1338,2019-03-25T12:27:37.641500,Jonas,you need to evaluate packages you install
1338,2019-03-25T12:27:52.642000,Jonas,same as anything.
1338,2019-03-25T12:30:24.642900,Nenita,is there a way to append multiple items at once? I hate out ugly it gets having to type list.append over and over
1338,2019-03-25T12:30:33.643100,Jonas,`list.extend(iterable)`
1338,2019-03-25T12:30:47.643400,Nenita,thx
1338,2019-03-25T12:31:20.643600,Jonas,it's more efficient as well.
1338,2019-03-25T12:32:24.644700,Clemmie,It it more efficient enough to do `x.extend([y])` in place of `append()` or is it better than some n calls of `append()`?
1338,2019-03-25T12:33:02.645200,Jonas,if you have `ipython` installed this is a good thing to test.
1338,2019-03-25T12:33:14.645600,Jonas,"No, `x.extend([y])` will be a lot slower"
1338,2019-03-25T12:33:48.646300,Clemmie,"Ok, the world is right again :wink:"
1338,2019-03-25T12:34:04.646500,Jonas,"```In [4]: %timeit [].extend([1])
130 ns ± 8.26 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)

In [5]: %timeit [].append(1)
76.1 ns ± 1.6 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
```"
1338,2019-03-25T12:35:54.647100,Clemmie,"I don’t have ipython in right now, but that is actually closer than I would have though"
1338,2019-03-25T12:36:23.647600,Clemmie,"I expect due to growing the list allocation, so extend catches up fairly quickly"
1338,2019-03-25T12:36:46.647800,Jonas,"```In [12]: %timeit x = []; x.append(1); x.append(2)

In [14]: %timeit x = []; x.extend(to_extend)

1338,2019-03-25T12:37:14.648400,Jonas,extend is better when you are extending anything more than 1 elements
1338,2019-03-25T12:37:35.649000,Jonas,"but doing `x.extend([1, 2])` has overhead, as it's allocating a list with two elements and then extending."
1338,2019-03-25T12:37:38.649200,Jonas,So your milage may vary
1338,2019-03-25T12:37:59.649700,Jonas,"counter-intuitively, `x.extend(iterable)` can be slower than `x.extend(list(iterable))`"
1338,2019-03-25T12:38:25.650500,Jonas,"as with the second case the length of the extension is *known* beforehand, whereas with the first it can be any length. So python grows the list dynamically"
1338,2019-03-25T12:38:32.651000,Clemmie,"well, the `list` call has a defined length"
1338,2019-03-25T12:38:34.651100,Jonas,which has added overhead
1338,2019-03-25T12:38:59.651300,Clemmie,makes sense
1338,2019-03-25T12:39:18.651600,Jonas,"to me it doesn't, as you're allocating a list with an unknown length anyway"
1338,2019-03-25T12:39:32.652000,Jonas,"`list(iterable)` still suffers from the issue, as it's grown dynamically"
1338,2019-03-25T12:39:46.652400,Jonas,"so `x.extend(list(iterable))` is senseless. But it's faster, so :shrug:"
1338,2019-03-25T12:40:26.653100,Clemmie,"ah, good point. I’ll have to take a look at the implementation of `extend`."
1338,2019-03-25T12:40:57.653700,Clemmie,Its probably simpler that way than having `extend` inspect the type
1338,2019-03-25T12:50:15.654700,Melynda,"I'd suggest that you use whatever is easier to read, since anything else is premature micro-optimisation. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"
1338,2019-03-25T12:52:29.654900,Nenita,"ok im coming across some real bs here and im sure there is a reason why, but its excruciatingly frustrating. First code is copied from stackoverflow link. The second line is mine. The first line works; testeddate is a string, however on my line (2nd), data['LOGDATE'] is a string, but i get an error saying datetime object received a string. wth?"
1338,2019-03-25T12:52:55.655700,Clemmie,"Oh, absolutely, just an interesting tidbit to bring out in a code review to annoy people"
1338,2019-03-25T12:54:52.656900,Clemmie,"<@Nenita> it is the difference between `strptime` and `strftime`. The first takes a string and format and makes a date, the other takes a date and spits out the string in the format you asked. If you try your line with `strptime` it should work"
1338,2019-03-25T12:56:12.657700,Nenita,"f :magic: -&gt; p and it works, but im having to cut the time out of the date and i thought strftime would do that."
1338,2019-03-25T12:58:12.660700,Clemmie,"Right, so you need a `strptime` to make it a date object of the format wanted, and then wrap that in a `strftime` to get out the string format you want"
1338,2019-03-25T13:03:10.663500,Clemmie,If you have some time :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: check out this talk Russel Keith-Magee gave at Djangocon <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y13thlpbri8>
1339,2019-03-25T12:57:19.659300,Melynda,"`strftime` is ""format this date/time instance into a string"", but `strptime` is ""parse this date-like string"". Very un-pythonic naming IMO"
1339,2019-03-25T12:57:57.660400,Nenita,i guess i could be lazy and use left(n)
1339,2019-03-25T12:58:36.661100,Clemmie,"or, regex capture groups and reorder"
1339,2019-03-25T12:59:26.661400,Nenita,time data '02.02.2019' does not match format '%d/%m/%y' :thinking_face:
1339,2019-03-25T12:59:40.661600,Melynda,"Indeed, `.` is not `/`"
1339,2019-03-25T12:59:55.661900,Nenita,oo man i hate dates so much right now lol
1339,2019-03-25T13:00:28.662200,Melynda,Will you have to work with timezones? That's where the real headaches are…
1339,2019-03-25T13:00:43.662600,Nenita,no - thank God
1339,2019-03-25T13:00:43.662700,My,Timezones are hell on earth
1339,2019-03-25T13:03:12.663700,Nenita,so is daylights saving time &gt;.&gt;
1339,2019-03-25T13:05:36.664200,Melynda,That's a subset of the general timezones problem!
1340,2019-03-25T14:18:51.664800,Nenita,is there an easy way to shoot back to the start of a loop whilst in the middle of the loop?
1340,2019-03-25T14:20:38.665400,Sasha,`continue`
1340,2019-03-25T14:20:42.665600,Marla,you could use `continue` inside of an `if` `else` clause
1340,2019-03-25T14:21:14.666100,Jorge,you might be able to do this with recursion

1340,2019-03-25T14:27:10.668100,Nenita,thanks <@Marla>
1340,2019-03-25T14:28:04.669000,Sasha,`continue` immediately jumps to the next loop iteration. `pass` does nothing. It's essentially a blank line for situations where a blank line isn't allowed.

```
Teams

1341,2019-03-25T17:26:59.695000,Deon,i think its NHLTeamsData['teamStats']['splits']
1341,2019-03-25T17:27:10.695500,Freeda,Ahh I can truncate it like that??
1341,2019-03-25T17:27:11.695600,Jorge,"in this part:
```
    for stat in NHLTeamsData['teamStats']:
        for split in NHLTeamsData['splits']:
            for stat in NHLTeamsData['stat']:
                gamesPlayed = stat['gamesPlayed']
```
you're traversing that a bit wrong

essentially that creates for loops over keys that dont exist on the root dict
what you want is this:
```
    for stat in team['teamStats']:
        for split in stat:
            for stat in split['stat']:
                gamesPlayed = stat['gamesPlayed']
```"
1341,2019-03-25T17:27:58.696500,Freeda,and that's because the loops won't iterate in those levels?

1345,2019-03-26T00:06:08.713600,Candra,Also with `re.compile(r'/(?:https:\/\/)?clips\.twitch\.tv\/(\S+)/i')` It doesn't work
1345,2019-03-26T00:06:52.714400,Sasha,"I think you might be getting Python regex syntax confused with Perl, with the `/ ... /i` enclosing slashes?"
1345,2019-03-26T00:07:08.714700,Candra,Let me lookup the substitution then
1345,2019-03-26T00:08:55.715000,Candra,Thanks <@Sasha> that seems to be working
1345,2019-03-26T00:09:04.715400,Candra,It is however cutting off 3 characters at the end
1345,2019-03-26T00:09:24.715600,Sasha,Due to the space?
1345,2019-03-26T00:10:02.715800,Candra,I'm unsure let me see
1345,2019-03-26T00:10:19.716000,Candra,Yeah so the space is messing it up
1345,2019-03-26T00:10:55.716900,Sasha,"The `\S` means a non-space character, I think. If you want to capture anything, use a period."
1345,2019-03-26T00:11:02.717100,Candra,Oaky
1345,2019-03-26T00:11:47.717800,Sasha,"Though normally a URL would have spaces encoded anyway, depending on its origin."
1345,2019-03-26T00:12:23.718500,Candra,"So basically I just wanna say if this link is located anywhere in another string, match it"
1345,2019-03-26T00:12:47.718800,Sasha,"Ah, then maybe you do want to truncate on spaces."
1345,2019-03-26T00:13:42.719400,Sasha,"Note that `match()` implies a match at the start of the string, too. `search()` will look everywhere for it."
1345,2019-03-26T00:14:59.719600,Candra,Okay thank you for the tip.
1345,2019-03-26T00:16:37.720100,Candra,Does it have a max length that it will match by default?
1345,2019-03-26T00:17:46.720700,Sasha,Not to my knowledge.
1345,2019-03-26T00:17:51.720900,Candra,Because it basically just seems to spit out the same length no matter what characters I add a spots before where it stops
1345,2019-03-26T00:18:39.721500,Sasha,"That's weird. Can you give some examples, and the regex you're using?"
1345,2019-03-26T00:19:52.722200,Candra,So this is what I have (this with and without the `\b` at the front and back both seem to give the same result
1345,2019-03-26T00:19:55.722400,Candra,`clip_regex = re.compile(r'\b(?:https://)?clips\.twitch\.tv/(.+)\b')`

1345,2019-03-26T00:21:54.723500,Candra,Unless that's not the whole result
1345,2019-03-26T00:22:03.723900,Candra,But in the debugger I can't see more than that
1345,2019-03-26T00:22:34.724600,Sasha,"Ah, I think the debug printout is just truncating the data, yeah. You should try printing the matching string."
1345,2019-03-26T00:22:36.724800,Candra,I might have figured it out
1345,2019-03-26T00:23:00.725200,Sasha,The `span` numbers indicate it matched a longer length.
1345,2019-03-26T00:26:32.725700,Candra,It doesn't seem to be matching the whole link. hmmm
1345,2019-03-26T00:27:06.726500,Candra,"looking at the groups, all the iterations of the regex I've tried only match after the `.tv/`"
1345,2019-03-26T00:27:16.726800,Candra,And up to the end of the link
1345,2019-03-26T00:28:03.727800,Candra,"I've tried with `\b` at beginning and end, with `.+`, `\S+`, removing escape characters before the `/` in the link"
1345,2019-03-26T00:28:34.728800,Candra,I'm probably missing something simple
1345,2019-03-26T00:28:50.729400,Candra,I'm unfortunately a noob when it comes to regex
1345,2019-03-26T00:29:20.729600,Sasha,"Well, you're only capturing the parenthesized group after the domain. I think the whole match would be available in `group(0)`, though."
1345,2019-03-26T00:30:39.730500,Candra,"Similar result, but I only want to capture the link itself, looking for the character to stop matching on whitespace"
1345,2019-03-26T00:31:49.731200,Sasha,Can you give an example where it's not working with `\b`?
1345,2019-03-26T00:32:08.731400,Candra,Yeah let me run it through
1345,2019-03-26T00:32:26.731700,Candra,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; clip_regex = re.compile(r'\b(?:https://)?clips\.twitch\.tv/(.+)\b')
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = clip_regex.search('<https://clips.twitch.tv/IcyZealousLapwingBlosdzokaythenzzzzsdfsdfsdfsdfsdfzzzzzzz> okay')
&gt;&gt;&gt; r.group(0)
'<https://clips.twitch.tv/IcyZealousLapwingBlosdzokaythenzzzzsdfsdfsdfsdfsdfzzzzzzz> okay'
```"
1345,2019-03-26T00:33:02.732800,Candra,Obviously my regex has an issue
1345,2019-03-26T00:33:06.733100,Candra,Somewhere
1345,2019-03-26T00:33:15.733300,Sasha,"Oh, my bad. You want either `\S` or a non-greedy `.+`."
1345,2019-03-26T00:33:27.733500,Candra,So remove parentheses?
1345,2019-03-26T00:36:07.735700,Sasha,"Sorry, let me explain. The `(.+)` is going to match as many characters as possible, including spaces, and THEN will try to match the `\b`, which would be at the end of the string. So you either want to use `(\S+)`, which only matches non-space characters, or `(.+?)`, which matches as few unrestricted characters as possible before the next `\b`."
1345,2019-03-26T00:36:34.736000,Candra,Yep actually just read the docs and saw that.
1345,2019-03-26T00:37:05.736700,Candra,So the ? basically says as soon as we hit \b we stop
1345,2019-03-26T00:37:18.736900,Candra,Yay it works!

The result is the “probability” that the skewness of your distribution is different to a normal one. In general be really careful with these type of statistics because you might want to decide a threshold (e.g. `pvalue &lt; 0.05`) in order to determine whether the moment is similar enough.

Paired with the t-test on the mean, standard deviation and kurtosis, these statistics can give you an indication on whether the distribution you are dealing with can be treated as normal. Take everything I said with a grain of salt, it is a gross approximation and you should look into a more theoretically precise definition.

Refer to something like: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normality_test>"

    try:

1365,2019-03-27T11:34:19.821400,Clemmie,"I think yes, but check the docs"
1365,2019-03-27T11:35:11.822600,Clemmie,using the argument flags can get you through almost all of the error checking you will need. About the only error checking you will need to implement is if flags interact and there can be error conditions based on the interactions
1365,2019-03-27T11:35:57.823400,Clemmie,"For instance `--bar` must have values in `[x,y,z]` if `--foo` is set"
1365,2019-03-27T11:37:10.823800,Clemmie,you can also use the `required` param
1365,2019-03-27T11:37:39.824200,Clemmie,probably even better than `nargs` in your example

1368,2019-03-27T14:17:21.845900,Ashley,"normally when you have a system like this, it doesn't actually care about the html report. Instead, it relies on some other output, like the JUnit XML output"
1368,2019-03-27T14:17:38.846500,Ashley,"that gives it a uniform, standardized format that can be easily ingested and parsed"
1368,2019-03-27T14:18:23.848200,Ashley,"There could, however, be a pytest plugin in play that knows how to submit the results as they come in into some other system, like a DB that your allure system is pulling from (or it's the system that the results are being pumped into)"
1368,2019-03-27T14:19:43.851000,Ashley,"I would first make sure you have your tests running properly. If they're outputting to an HTML file, they might not be outputting to the digestible system that allure depends on"
1368,2019-03-27T14:19:59.851500,Merlyn,Pytest generated lots of files some json and other format but using that files it should generate results as per docs but it's not showing tests in report
1368,2019-03-27T14:20:31.851800,Ashley,are you sure it's still generating those files?
1368,2019-03-27T14:20:42.852000,Merlyn,Yes
1368,2019-03-27T14:21:04.852400,Ashley,"also I just checked, and there is a pytest plugin made by allure"
1368,2019-03-27T14:21:12.852700,Ashley,I assume you're using that plugin?
1368,2019-03-27T14:21:29.853200,Merlyn,Yes allure-pytest
1368,2019-03-27T14:22:50.853600,Ashley,have you taken a look at what it's outputting?
1368,2019-03-27T14:24:00.855300,Merlyn,I actually checked by opening json files generated by allure it contains some test info status and duration like that
1368,2019-03-27T14:24:20.855600,Clemmie,how are you running pytest?
1368,2019-03-27T14:24:31.855900,Merlyn,Via terminal 
1368,2019-03-27T14:24:43.856700,Ashley,what is the full command you're using?
1368,2019-03-27T14:24:51.857100,Clemmie,"sorry, I meant the exact command? Sometimes you need to add flags to get the needed output"
1368,2019-03-27T14:25:15.857800,Merlyn,"I have runner class so im running 
Python -m runner "
1368,2019-03-27T14:25:30.858400,Ashley,runner class?
1368,2019-03-27T14:25:59.859400,Merlyn,It contains pytest.main([args])
1368,2019-03-27T14:26:10.859700,Clemmie,allure-pytest docs say you need to run with this format in the usage docs `py.test --alluredir=%allure_result_folder% ./tests`
1368,2019-03-27T14:26:44.860900,Ashley,"`py.test` is actually deprecated, so you only need to do `pytest` now :wink:"
1368,2019-03-27T14:26:46.861000,Merlyn,I gave --alluredir in pytest.main args
1368,2019-03-27T14:26:52.861300,Clemmie,"well, yeah"
1368,2019-03-27T14:26:59.861600,Clemmie,opportunity for a pull request
1368,2019-03-27T14:27:07.861900,Ashley,<@Merlyn> what is the purpose of your runner class?
1368,2019-03-27T14:27:42.862900,Merlyn,It build command dynamic for UI tests and api teats
1368,2019-03-27T14:28:13.863700,Merlyn,Pytest command and get args to tests
1368,2019-03-27T14:28:51.863900,Ashley,pytest can already do that
1368,2019-03-27T14:29:16.864300,Ashley,what was the problem you faced that made you create this runner class?
1368,2019-03-27T14:30:21.865600,Merlyn,To load plugin according to test types
1368,2019-03-27T14:31:05.865800,Ashley,pytest can already do that
1368,2019-03-27T14:33:01.868100,Ashley,"I would recommend looking to that, as it's usually best to work within a system as much as you can (in this case, pytest) to avoid other issues"
1368,2019-03-27T14:33:02.868400,Ashley,for now
1368,2019-03-27T14:33:05.868600,Hiroko,"also, make sure you’re using the ruight allure lib"
1368,2019-03-27T14:33:11.869000,Hiroko,one comes up as deprecated

1368,2019-03-27T14:36:00.872000,Merlyn,<@Hiroko>  I'm using this only
1368,2019-03-27T14:36:19.872400,Merlyn,Yes allure generate and allure serve
1368,2019-03-27T14:37:37.872600,Ashley,try the serve command only
1369,2019-03-27T13:54:26.843400,Johna,whoa what is that? i just see the terminal output when i run pytest
1370,2019-03-27T16:43:31.876200,Nenita,"i know this workspace isn't meant too much for tkinter, but I found a really odd occurance (not an issue though) and was curious if anyone would know why. Top line works, bottom doesn't. It doesn't error out, it just finds a length of 0 in the tree."
1371,2019-03-27T16:48:26.876700,Raguel,I believe because of generator expression? does doing `next` work?
1371,2019-03-27T16:48:48.876900,Jimmy,Yeah that's what I though as well
1371,2019-03-27T16:49:14.877100,Jimmy,what do you mean by `it just finds a length of 0 in the tree`
1371,2019-03-27T16:50:30.877300,Raguel,"```
li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in li:
    li.remove(num)
    
gen = (li.remove(num) for num in li)
```
I believe it is same thing here. The generator expression doesn’t remove elements till I do `next`"
1371,2019-03-27T16:55:14.877500,Nenita,"what do you mean by next, never heard, nor used, it."
1371,2019-03-27T16:56:32.877700,Nenita,"<@Jimmy> upon stepping through the code, it would always skip the function because it was finding no length or values."
1371,2019-03-27T17:07:26.877900,Raguel,this link might be helpful in explaining the concept: <https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/>
1371,2019-03-27T17:11:00.878200,Raguel,"You can try this snippet too:
```
li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in mylist:
    print(num**2)

#generator object
sq = (num**2 for num in li) 
 
next(sq)
next(sq)
next(sq)
next(sq)

1372,2019-03-27T18:44:39.879400,Jordon,"if i add a program to `PATH`,  I should be able to auto complete it in the terminal right? (OSX) for example for jmeter: ```export PATH=$PATH:/Users/bli1/tools/jmeter/apache-jmeter-5.1.1/bin
``` where `jmeter` is located inside of `bin`"
1372,2019-03-27T18:48:50.879800,Hiroko,"you’d have to reload the terminal, I think"
1372,2019-03-27T18:49:05.880300,Hiroko,or `source ~/.bashrc` or equivalent
1372,2019-03-27T18:50:03.880700,Jordon,<@Hiroko> nope didnt work =/. I also restarted my terminal
1372,2019-03-27T18:50:57.881100,Hiroko,what happens when you `echo $PATH`?
1372,2019-03-27T18:51:03.881300,Hiroko,is that path available?
1372,2019-03-27T18:51:16.881500,Jordon,nope i dont see it =/
1372,2019-03-27T18:51:45.881700,Jordon,hmmm
1372,2019-03-27T18:52:25.882300,Kristine,Well that sounds like a problem. `echo $PATH` is working fine for me.
1372,2019-03-27T18:52:25.882400,Hiroko,how did you add this thing?
1372,2019-03-27T18:52:44.882900,Hiroko,did you do it in the terminal or write to file?
1372,2019-03-27T18:53:14.883300,Kristine,"Yeah if you did it in an external editor, you may have messed up the permissions."
1372,2019-03-27T18:54:16.883800,Hiroko,or if you just did it in the terminal it won’t stick
1372,2019-03-27T18:54:37.884000,Kristine,"Oh yeah, that too."
1372,2019-03-27T18:54:50.884400,Kristine,You should be putting that line in .bash_profile in your user directory really.
1372,2019-03-27T18:55:00.884700,Jordon,hmm okay
1372,2019-03-27T18:55:14.885000,Kristine,"If you have that there, and it’s not working, try chowning it, and chmod u+rwxing it"
1372,2019-03-27T18:55:41.885200,Hiroko,but before you do that
1372,2019-03-27T18:55:52.885500,Hiroko,would help to know exactly what you did <@Jordon>
1372,2019-03-27T18:56:02.886100,Hiroko,"what file, what command, etc"
1372,2019-03-27T18:56:59.887000,Jordon,bashrc wasn’t working
1372,2019-03-27T18:56:59.887100,Jordon,nice it works
1372,2019-03-27T18:56:59.887200,Jordon,i clearly dont know the difference
1372,2019-03-27T18:57:00.887300,Jordon,i stuck i in bash_profile and it worked
1372,2019-03-27T18:57:13.887800,Jordon,my msgs are out of order due to wifi problems…
1372,2019-03-27T18:57:14.887900,Kristine,"Yeah, you can share that easily with the tail of .bash_history in your user directory, just be sure to censor any passwords you may have typed as command line arguments anywhere."
1372,2019-03-27T18:57:28.888100,Kristine,Oh well you got it working at least.
1372,2019-03-27T18:58:08.888300,Jordon,thanks for the help everyone!
1372,2019-03-27T18:58:15.888500,Jordon,much appreciated
1372,2019-03-27T18:59:41.889500,Kristine,"Yeah, .bashrc didn’t work because on OSX, when you run <http://Terminal.app|Terminal.app>, it creates a login-shell in each new terminal window instead of a non-login shell like you would normally experience on Linux. .bashrc is for non-login shells, and .bash_profile is for login shells"
1372,2019-03-27T19:00:20.889700,Hiroko,does that also apply to iterm2?
1372,2019-03-27T19:00:28.890100,Kristine,"I believe so, yes."
1372,2019-03-27T19:00:33.890500,Hiroko,gotcha.
1372,2019-03-27T19:01:08.891100,Kristine,"I use iterm2, but I haven’t actually paid close enough attention. Probably has an option somewhere to disable that behavior given how much freedom it gives us."
1372,2019-03-27T19:01:15.891400,Kristine,Absolutely a gem of a program.
1372,2019-03-27T19:01:49.891900,Jordon,i should start using it
1372,2019-03-27T19:01:49.892000,Jordon,everyone at work uses it
1372,2019-03-27T19:01:50.892100,Jordon,im on the default terminal
1372,2019-03-27T19:02:26.892800,Kristine,"One solution if you’re really used to using .bashrc from working on linux so much is to add
```if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
   source ~/.bashrc
fi```
to your .bash_profile"
1372,2019-03-27T19:03:18.893600,Kristine,"that way you could even share a .bashrc file across multiple linux and mac machines, and not have to worry about it not functioning properly on the macs, or having to echo the changes across to your .bash_profile every time"
1372,2019-03-27T19:03:29.893800,Jordon,thanks for the tips!

1374,2019-03-27T21:43:36.897600,Hiroko,I’m not sure how it would be useful?
1374,2019-03-27T21:43:58.898100,Hiroko,"requires you to write the json definition first, where you could be spending that time writing the code itself"
1374,2019-03-27T21:48:21.900300,Stacy,"yeah so i just provided it json output from an API, so i'm not sure if the code being generated is to ultimately be able to parse/use the json output more efficiently moving forward or something, if you were to save the json output to a file, read it in using python then leveraging the python generated code or something.  no idea."
1374,2019-03-27T21:53:59.901000,Kristine,Maybe it’s more useful for schema and/or GraphQL? I don’t know those personally so I can’t speak for the practicality of using it for those.
1374,2019-03-27T22:14:56.902300,Kristine,Well one clear advantage it has over Swagger Files is a better name :stuck_out_tongue:
1375,2019-03-27T22:12:04.901900,Letty,"Seems more like a competitor to Swagger files. For when you’re the one writing the (public) API and you want to automatically generate API clients for many languages, or even support languages you haven’t considered yet."

1376,2019-03-28T03:26:07.000900,Valeri,<@Cathi> Why do you need the node server in between?
1376,2019-03-28T03:26:49.001700,Cathi,It will be used to serve React frontend. I'd then proxy the API requests to Django servers..
1376,2019-03-28T03:27:32.002200,Valeri,There is an obvious overhead don't you think
1376,2019-03-28T03:27:33.002400,Valeri,?
1376,2019-03-28T03:28:00.002800,Cathi,That I can put the react part inside Django?
1376,2019-03-28T03:30:00.003600,Cathi,I want to use WS and message brokers later which will be handled by Django and nodejs will notify the users...

1376,2019-03-28T03:30:20.004000,Cathi,Is this right?
1376,2019-03-28T03:32:17.004600,Cathi,Please tell if I'm supposed to figure out that or question of this type can be asked haha..
1376,2019-03-28T03:32:50.005000,Valeri,What do you mean by: `I'd then proxy the API requests to Django servers..`?
1376,2019-03-28T03:33:27.006200,Valeri,There's a javascript server serving frontend reqs and a django server serving backend requests arising from the frontend?
1376,2019-03-28T03:33:35.006500,Valeri,Is that what you wish to do?
1376,2019-03-28T03:34:08.007300,Cathi,"Node will run on specific ports and Django on its own. So users will request the node server. If it is API request, then I'll forward that to Django endpoints from node's, that'll need proxy."

1376,2019-03-28T03:35:19.008600,Valeri,Aah basically a react/vue frontend and a django backend is what you're trying to do?
1376,2019-03-28T03:36:02.008800,Cathi,Yes exactly.

1382,2019-03-28T09:25:46.063400,Clemmie,Does the message with id `2` already exist? If it does change `message=tnx.id` to `message_id=tnx.id` If it doesn’t you need to create a message object and then hand that off to `message=`
1382,2019-03-28T09:27:01.063800,Valeri,"Or, simply `message=tnx`"
1382,2019-03-28T09:27:14.064100,Clemmie,"yup, I missed that"

1383,2019-03-28T10:12:35.067700,Florencio,i want to compare values in two different tables
1383,2019-03-28T10:13:03.068100,Florencio,"can I not do this:
```
msg_list = Message.objects.filter(status=""Accepted"")
    tnx_list = Transaction.objects.get(id)

1383,2019-03-28T10:16:19.068600,Clemmie,"You can, but not that way"
1383,2019-03-28T10:18:14.070400,Clemmie,"in you model `message` is a foreign key in  `Transaction`, so you reversed the comparison of id. Also `filter()` returns a ``QuerySet` and `get()` returns a model instance. A `QuerySet` is an iterable, so you need to iterate through it to check ids of individual instances"
1383,2019-03-28T10:28:59.070800,Florencio,yeah
1383,2019-03-28T10:29:33.071400,Florencio,i iterate through message and output the items
1383,2019-03-28T10:30:07.072300,Florencio,Now just discovered I need to differentiate the ones worked on and the ones not worked on
1383,2019-03-28T10:30:10.072400,Clemmie,So please show that code
1383,2019-03-28T10:31:16.073400,Florencio,"```
def accepted_list(request):
    msg_list = Message.objects.filter(status=""Accepted"")
    
    pd = {

    }
    return render(request, 'manageportal/accepted_list.html', pd)
```"
1383,2019-03-28T10:31:30.073800,Clemmie,and please use the snippet feature found with the `+` next to the comment box - it adds line numbers to the code so we can talk more directly
1383,2019-03-28T10:32:03.074400,Clemmie,"Ok, so you got rid of the logic. Are you having an issue now?"
1383,2019-03-28T10:32:39.074700,Florencio,no issue with this
1383,2019-03-28T10:33:43.075500,Florencio,I just want to check if this particular `id` in `message` exist in `tansaction`
1383,2019-03-28T10:35:22.076500,Florencio,that's why I used `get` for transaction cos the `id` is supposed to be once
1383,2019-03-28T10:35:28.076700,Hiroko,what’s the model relationship between `Message` and `Transaction`?
1383,2019-03-28T10:36:17.077400,Florencio,transaction has a column 'message' that is a foreignkey
1383,2019-03-28T10:39:05.079200,Hiroko,"```try:
    transaction = Transaction.objects.get(message_id = id)
except Transaction.DoesNotExist as e:
   # do something with exception

... do something with transaction model```"
1383,2019-03-28T10:39:38.079500,Florencio,okay
1383,2019-03-28T10:46:16.080100,Florencio,the `id` part i don't understand
1383,2019-03-28T10:50:49.080500,Florencio,it throws exception
1383,2019-03-28T10:55:23.080900,Clemmie,what exception?
1383,2019-03-28T10:56:51.081500,Hiroko,"<@Florencio> if you want help, providing details is pretty important"
1383,2019-03-28T10:57:23.082200,Hiroko,"for example your query above, providing said exception info would be a key part in figuring the solution"
1383,2019-03-28T11:02:31.082400,Florencio,sorry
1383,2019-03-28T11:02:35.082600,Florencio,"`int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'builtin_function_or_method'`"

1383,2019-03-28T11:03:49.083500,Clemmie,the entire method

1383,2019-03-28T11:11:59.087100,Dawn,ah like that. but i do need a datetime object because i'm sending it to an odbc
1383,2019-03-28T11:12:46.088000,Dawn,that's becoming a mess..
1383,2019-03-28T11:13:28.088200,Florencio,okay
1383,2019-03-28T11:13:36.088800,Florencio,I'll do that
1383,2019-03-28T11:14:46.090400,Florencio,None

```
if isinstance(value, pendulum.Pendulum):

```
that's a real detour"
1383,2019-03-28T11:21:32.093000,Dawn,"and even that doesn't work as wanted, i just want a naive datetime as output, without the timezone explicitly included"

1383,2019-03-28T11:24:42.094300,Dawn,don't know any other way to do that
1383,2019-03-28T11:25:18.095600,Dawn,"the use case is:
i have a datetime object with UTC timezone
i want to convert it to CET timezone
output should still be a datetime object because a database is going to handle it"
1383,2019-03-28T11:25:32.095800,Clemmie,do you need pendulum for anything else? if not you should probably use the `pytz` package (python timezone)
1383,2019-03-28T11:26:20.096300,Dawn,"i use it in other places to set the current time, but can use both"

Thanks!"
1383,2019-03-28T11:38:53.109300,Florencio,<@Clemmie> I only want to work with id
1383,2019-03-28T11:39:43.110000,Clemmie,can you describe what you are trying to do in words - your code doesn’t make a huge amount of sense to me
1383,2019-03-28T11:39:59.110400,Clemmie,"I understand what it is trying to do, but what it is trying to do is confusing"
1383,2019-03-28T11:41:06.110700,Florencio,okay i'll try
1383,2019-03-28T11:41:43.111400,Florencio,i have lets say 4 different request for different products
1383,2019-03-28T11:42:12.111900,Florencio,this method shows only the ones I accepted
1383,2019-03-28T11:42:41.112500,Florencio,"in the ones accepted, they're some I have attended to and others I'm yet to"
1383,2019-03-28T11:43:20.113700,Florencio,"the ones I've attended to, their Ids are saved in `Transaction` table"
1383,2019-03-28T11:43:27.114000,Clemmie,"I get that - but the code seems to care about returning the accepted messages, where it seems to me you want to return the list of transactions whose messages were accepted"
1383,2019-03-28T11:44:43.114800,Florencio,okay
1383,2019-03-28T11:44:51.115300,Clemmie,am i correct?
1383,2019-03-28T11:44:54.115600,Clemmie,or not
1383,2019-03-28T11:45:17.116100,Florencio,but not all Accepted Messages are in Transaction
1383,2019-03-28T11:45:44.116700,Florencio,That's why I just go with if it is Accepted and also have it's Id in Transaction
1383,2019-03-28T11:46:20.117300,Clemmie,"Do you need all accepted messages, or only accepted messages that are also in a transaction?"
1383,2019-03-28T11:46:42.117700,Clemmie,"Or all accepted messages, and whether they are in a transaction or not"
1383,2019-03-28T11:48:43.118200,Florencio,"yeah all Accepted messages that are in Transaction  will have `tick = ""ok""`"
1383,2019-03-28T11:50:05.119100,Florencio,"else `tick = """"`"
1383,2019-03-28T11:50:08.119300,Clemmie,"so all accepted messages, with tick ok for those in a transaction"
1383,2019-03-28T11:50:37.119500,Florencio,yeah
1383,2019-03-28T11:50:42.119700,Florencio,that's it
1383,2019-03-28T11:54:55.123000,Clemmie,"Ok, so now put that into code. In particular you are not iterating through the message list to check if each message is in a transaction (and you will need to use `filter()` in the lookup, not `get()` as by you model a message can be in more than one transaction. You will probably also want to put them into a dict like `{'ok':[&lt;list of messages&gt;'], 'not':[&lt;list_of_messages&gt;]}`"
1383,2019-03-28T11:56:59.123200,Florencio,wow
1383,2019-03-28T11:57:51.123600,Florencio,i'll try to understand what you mean
1383,2019-03-28T12:04:30.124000,Florencio,i think i'll just leave this
1383,2019-03-28T12:05:12.124900,Florencio,"cos in my head it should be simple, but when i try to implement it, it's something else"
1383,2019-03-28T12:06:15.125800,Florencio,I'll make the field unique so that I dont have the same request twice in `Transaction`
1383,2019-03-28T12:07:09.126500,Clemmie,You can also make it a OneToOne - it sounds like that is somewhat more correct for your use case
1383,2019-03-28T12:07:46.126800,Florencio,but it's Foreignkey
1383,2019-03-28T12:07:58.127000,Clemmie,Is this a production system?
1383,2019-03-28T12:08:08.127200,Florencio,yep
1383,2019-03-28T12:08:10.127400,Clemmie,"oh, ok"
1383,2019-03-28T12:09:30.127900,Florencio,that's why I wanted to differentiate them by `ticks`
1383,2019-03-28T12:10:28.128800,Florencio,"so that I know while going through the list of all `Accepted` requests, I could see the ones with the `ticks`"

1388,2019-03-28T14:21:49.133900,Carmen,<@Deon> Sorry for the delay on replying to this.
1388,2019-03-28T14:22:29.134100,Carmen,So what you're doing is setting up a full git repo copy of your code on your server and serving from that directory.
1388,2019-03-28T14:29:06.134300,Carmen,Then you can use the built-in git remote functionality to push code to that remote production repo with a simple `git push production master`
1388,2019-03-28T14:29:28.134500,Carmen,"Assuming, of course, that you've named the remote `production` and you're serving up the `master` branch."
1388,2019-03-28T14:30:41.134700,Carmen,"If you're serving from gunicorn, however, I'd recommend that you wrap the push deployment process inside another script (such as a Fabric fabfile) and have it restart gunicorn automatically once it's pushed the code to the production git remote."
1388,2019-03-28T14:31:51.134900,Deon,"I think my understanding of git kinda stinks, so let me read up a little bit more on that so it makes more sense"
1389,2019-03-28T17:20:32.137200,Henrietta,"has anyone in here used jinja2 to generate HTML, PHP, Js files? I am thinking of automating some part of the process for a current project I'm working on and could use some advice in the structure."
1389,2019-03-28T17:38:19.137300,Henry,"Depending on what you’re hoping to learn, you could take a look at the `subprocess` module to execute commands to install packages. You might want to look at setting up config files to specify those packages/versions etc and parse those with the script. Don’t know of any python provisioning libraries that might help you with this. Learning `subprocess` might be more useful in any case."

1391,2019-03-28T21:06:03.139800,Candra,log to a flat file
1391,2019-03-28T21:06:14.140200,Hiroko,"if you were saying elasticsearch or solr for a search engine, then I could understand"
1391,2019-03-28T21:06:26.140700,Hiroko,<@Candra> rotating flat file :slightly_smiling_face:
1391,2019-03-28T21:06:30.140900,Candra,^
1391,2019-03-28T21:06:34.141100,Huong,Well it may eventually get to that  point
1391,2019-03-28T21:06:39.141300,Candra,one giant log file :upside_down_face:
1391,2019-03-28T21:06:44.141800,Hiroko,"been there, done that"
1391,2019-03-28T21:06:46.142000,Huong,hah
1391,2019-03-28T21:06:49.142200,Hiroko,it was about 18 GB in size
1391,2019-03-28T21:07:04.142800,Hiroko,lets just say grep was a wee bit slow
1391,2019-03-28T21:07:06.142900,Huong,Jeez haha
1391,2019-03-28T21:07:23.143300,Candra,"To be fair you'd be making premature improvements to something (I'm not trying to make assumptions as to what you're doing, but in general unless you NEED it you don't need it)"
1391,2019-03-28T21:07:36.143700,Hiroko,would definitely agree with this
1391,2019-03-28T21:07:45.144100,Hiroko,"and if you do want to log to a db, don’t"
1391,2019-03-28T21:07:53.144500,Hiroko,use elastic search or solr instead
1391,2019-03-28T21:08:30.145800,Candra,"All of the logs at my company, unless transaction audit log, use normal rotating file handlers for logging."
1391,2019-03-28T21:08:37.146300,Candra,"Logging is already hard, don't make it harder :slightly_smiling_face:"
1391,2019-03-28T21:08:39.146500,Hiroko,"if you’re logging to your own db which your app relies on, you’re dumping a ton of writes into your db"
1391,2019-03-28T21:08:55.147100,Hiroko,"so, therefore performance will go south from what it already is"
1391,2019-03-28T21:08:56.147200,Huong,Ok I'll have to check that handler out. Thanks!
1391,2019-03-28T21:09:01.147600,Candra,No problem!
1391,2019-03-28T21:09:48.148900,Huong,Thanks <@Hiroko> as well
1391,2019-03-28T21:11:03.149800,Candra,Check this out as well <@Huong> it brings up some good points and options to eventually save items to a database if you want to be able to query

1392,2019-03-28T21:14:21.150700,Raguel,"Hey guys, a general design question: I have a table in Postgres which would be used to generate many charts (most probably R markdown for that), and those charts will eventually go in reports. Now those charts will be using subset of data from that table with some form of aggregation/group by, and filters. I want to design a process which should be scalable if anyone wants to add new metrics/charts. How should I go about it? Should I have some lookup tables and then functions that would generate dynamic queries for each chart’s data, or what other ways/techniques/tools are there? We have Tableau too and that can also be considered."

1395,2019-03-29T02:50:38.161800,Valeri,You need to add the above decorator and add the fields you need to parametrize inside the decorator and provide test data

1398,2019-03-29T06:20:47.184200,Florencio,okay
1398,2019-03-29T06:24:24.184500,Florencio,but this is different
1398,2019-03-29T06:25:52.184700,Hiroko,How?
1398,2019-03-29T06:45:29.186600,Florencio,the 404 page that shows in Django if what is requested doesn't exist
1398,2019-03-29T06:53:37.187300,Vanessa,This is probably because you have DEBUG set to TRUE in your Django settings  <@Florencio>
1398,2019-03-29T06:54:26.187900,Florencio,ohh... so that means I can only create my own 404 page in production then
1398,2019-03-29T06:54:35.188100,Hiroko,or turn off the debug setting?
1398,2019-03-29T06:55:12.188800,Florencio,I read somewhere that it's necessary during dev/testing
1398,2019-03-29T06:55:28.189100,Florencio,thanks for the clarity
1398,2019-03-29T06:55:41.189300,Hiroko,not really
1398,2019-03-29T06:55:46.189500,Hiroko,"its useful, sure"
1398,2019-03-29T06:55:49.189700,Hiroko,but not necesary
1398,2019-03-29T06:56:01.189900,Florencio,ohh
1398,2019-03-29T06:56:49.190500,Hiroko,"and in your case, with a custom 404  page, you won’t get it, because you’ll get the django debug error stack trace"
1398,2019-03-29T06:57:05.190800,Florencio,"yeah, that shows too"
1398,2019-03-29T06:57:38.191200,Florencio,okay maybe I'll do this later
1398,2019-03-29T06:58:02.191700,Florencio,i have a question about file uploads or some questions

1398,2019-03-29T07:00:04.193400,Florencio,what I want to achieve is for admin to create holidays/events products sales for a particular period and then when it's time it automatically goes off
1398,2019-03-29T07:00:15.193700,Florencio,e.g Easter is coming
1398,2019-03-29T07:01:05.194700,Florencio,"so we have like discounts for our iPhone s7, Samsung 8s, Gionee s11 lite"
1398,2019-03-29T07:02:04.195800,Hiroko,this is an ecommerce thing?
1398,2019-03-29T07:02:15.196100,Florencio,sort of
1398,2019-03-29T07:03:09.197100,Florencio,"on my admin panel, I click on `create feature` inputs `event name`-this name will be the name of the folders all the images i'll put will be saved and the paths save in db"
1398,2019-03-29T07:03:40.198000,Hiroko,pretty standard
1398,2019-03-29T07:03:46.198200,Florencio,so when I'm done and click save. It starts appearing on the user end

The reason being that `unittest.TestCase` has its own test running logic that would break if pytest tried to mess with it. So to be safe, they just have pytest treat those kinds of classes as they would normally be treated, which means you can't have things like fixtures."

1404,2019-03-29T11:37:33.236700,Cammie,Its crazy we have to fake this
1404,2019-03-29T11:47:38.237000,Claudine,is there a reason python doesn't have switch/case?
1404,2019-03-29T11:48:24.237200,Clemmie,in the docs in fact <https://docs.python.org/3/faq/design.html#why-isn-t-there-a-switch-or-case-statement-in-python>
1404,2019-03-29T11:49:43.238100,Clemmie,"I haven’t read deeply, but to me dynamic typing and the idea of a switch statement are somewhat in tension"
1404,2019-03-29T11:50:38.238800,Claudine,"needs? nah, it's just a common construct"
1404,2019-03-29T11:57:06.241800,Genesis,"<@Clemmie> is has nothing to do with dynamic typing. Its moreso the confusion around the `break` statement inside switch statements.  Switch statements have a ""feature"" where they passthrough to the next statement unless you use break. There are very few scenarios where this is actually needed, and it mostly is confusing to begginers and a lot of people don't understand that feature. So python, which is supposed to be easier to parse for begginers, just doesn't support it. Forces you to write your code in a way thats easier to understand"
1404,2019-03-29T12:00:09.243700,Clemmie,"Do you have a citation for that? I’m not saying you are wrong, but the reasonings I can find - In the docs: do it with `if elif else` “There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.” and in the pep noted in the docs - 275 there is a throwaway line that speaks to the issue with dynamic typing `Note that the constants need not be all of the same type, but they should be comparable to the type of the switch variable.`"
1404,2019-03-29T12:01:50.246200,Clemmie,I also don’t know about “easier to parse for beginners” there are plenty of operators and reserved words in the standard lib that are barely comprehensible by experts. I mean `:=` was accepted for 3.8
1404,2019-03-29T12:02:45.248100,Mora,"GDScript, which is a Python-esque language for Godot Engine, chose to use “match”: `<https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html#match>`
Following from the thought that `break` is often forgotten, `match` assumes each case breaks unless an explicit `continue` is encountered."
1404,2019-03-29T12:03:02.248400,Clemmie,"It is a good beginner language because you don’t _need_ to use these features, but I don’t think there is any motivating factor to keep python easy for beginners. More don’t add functionality if it can be easily handled in an already existing way"

1407,2019-03-29T13:04:43.262400,Jonas,and use `glob.glob()` on the filenames
1407,2019-03-29T13:05:02.263100,Jonas,`[filename for filename in files_i_can_list if glob.matches(filename)]`...
1407,2019-03-29T13:06:03.264500,Tyson,You mean like `os.chroot`? I was hoping for a more easy solution. I was fiddling around with `glob.escape` but I'm not sure that works in all cases...
1407,2019-03-29T13:06:52.265900,Tyson,<@Jonas> so I'd list the folder filenames into a list and then just glob the list content?

1407,2019-03-29T14:03:25.288800,Clemmie,It shouldn’t have the paren - unless you have multiple

1407,2019-03-29T14:03:38.289200,Freeda,u6 (+102)
1407,2019-03-29T14:03:56.289600,Freeda,but the '\' is a hard-match right?

1407,2019-03-29T14:04:16.290500,Clemmie,just 6? not 3 chars?
1407,2019-03-29T14:04:21.290700,Freeda,sometimes it's 3
1407,2019-03-29T14:04:29.290900,Freeda,could be 5.5 could be 6.5
1407,2019-03-29T14:04:46.291200,Clemmie,is it always followed by a paren?

1412,2019-03-29T17:19:50.317800,Freeda,I commented a line under a with above the function
1412,2019-03-29T17:19:51.318000,Freeda,whoops
1412,2019-03-29T17:20:08.318100,Freeda,"Okay, back at the ValueError"
1412,2019-03-29T17:24:34.319200,Freeda,think it's because there are zeros in the column?
1412,2019-03-29T17:25:29.319900,Freeda,"it says 'occurred at index 0', first line is a zero, maybe that's the cause"
1412,2019-03-29T17:25:45.320600,Freeda,Should I set zeros to np.nan? or maybe there's an exception to fix this error
1412,2019-03-29T17:26:30.320800,Freeda,This is the column I want to apply the function to
1412,2019-03-29T17:31:35.321700,Raguel,"I believe it is throwing error because of this line `if df[df['overunder'].str.contains('u')]:` as this line returns a whole dataframe, and if statement doesn't know what to evaluate it to"
1412,2019-03-29T17:37:14.323200,Freeda,I had a hunch that may be it so I removed the outside df[ ] wrapper but it didnt work
1412,2019-03-29T17:37:35.323800,Freeda,threw the same error... wouldn't df['overunder'] just return that column?
1412,2019-03-29T17:38:18.324000,Freeda,So this is what I have now...
1412,2019-03-29T17:48:07.327200,Kelley,"Also, based on the fact that you don't use the `row` argument anywhere in the function, I think you're misunderstanding the purpose of `df.apply`"
1412,2019-03-29T17:50:53.328500,Kelley,either that or you should be referencing `row` somewhere in the function
1413,2019-03-29T16:58:03.309500,Kelley,"can you describe the issue? is there an error/stacktrace, specific outputs that you're expecting vs actually getting"
1414,2019-03-29T17:25:43.320500,Raguel,can you share sample data?
1414,2019-03-29T17:32:15.322500,Raguel,your `if` statement needs to evaluate to some `boolean` form here

1414,2019-03-29T17:46:15.326000,Kelley,There should be multiple lines above the ValueError you pasted which I hope points to the exact line where the error occurred
1414,2019-03-29T17:49:48.327900,Kelley,maybe you actually want to do `df['ou_pnl'] = evaluate_overunder(df)`

I have a backend that adds a bunch of time.

First, I saved the timestamp;
```
self._timestamp = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1553944144)

# 1553944144 = Saturday, March 30, 2019 8:09:04 PM GMT+09:00
```
Then add the timestamp and return it to the client;
```
arrival_time  = self._timestamp + datetime.timedelta(seconds=g['walking_time']);
departure_time  = self._timestamp;

# arrival_time 2019-03-30 20:11:21
# departure_time 2019-03-30 20:41:21

d1.source_to_dest = {
    'arrival_time': arrival_time,
    'departure_time': departure_time
}

The above part works well but when I check the returned value on the client side, it shows;
```
arrival_time: ""Sun, 31 Mar 2019 00:26:08 GMT""

1) I need help in python package making.
Basically, there's a repo on github written in python and cython.
Currently, it requires cloning, installing gcc and python dependencies to build and run it which is not easy way for new inexperienced users.
I want to make a python package so that it will have a common installation procedure on all platforms(windows, linux)
$ pip install &lt;package&gt;
will it possible considering it requires gcc to build.

2) To help the new users (considering it requires installing gcc and many things which have different installation procedure depending on platforms), I am also looking to make a standalone package to ship and came across PyInstaller. Will it work considering it requires something to pack that doesn't belongs to python(gcc)."

1443,2019-04-01T05:03:04.468400,Jannie,I am working on git bash.
1443,2019-04-01T05:04:01.468700,Shawana,<@Jannie> you could try <https://github.com/regisf/virtualenvwrapper-powershell>
1443,2019-04-01T05:04:50.469000,Jannie,I will try
1443,2019-04-01T05:21:05.469900,Jannie,Does virtualenvwrapper exist only on windows?
1443,2019-04-01T05:21:55.470600,Jannie,"I think the command of activating virtualenv is ""workon"""
1443,2019-04-01T05:22:14.471100,Jannie,But it is relevant with virtualenvwrapper. Is it right?
1443,2019-04-01T05:22:46.471400,Shawana,"what do you mean with ""is relevant""?"
1443,2019-04-01T05:25:13.473100,Jannie,"Activating command of virtualenv is ""workon"", I think. ""workon"" is available only on windows?"
1443,2019-04-01T05:26:34.474100,Shawana,"no, if you are using virtualenvwrapper the command `workon` is available"
1443,2019-04-01T05:28:12.474900,Shawana,virtualenvwrapper is an extension to virtualenv (see the docs@ <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>)
1443,2019-04-01T05:29:30.475100,Jannie,I see.
1443,2019-04-01T05:31:10.476300,Shawana,"If you are on windows, I recommend using the wrapper with powershell linked above, because you want to use powershell anyways - and to manage your virtualenvs with this module works seamless"
1443,2019-04-01T05:31:29.476500,Jannie,OK. Thank you
1443,2019-04-01T05:37:55.478600,Jannie,"I have installed djangorestframework and types ""python manage.py runserver"" on venv. But there is error."
1443,2019-04-01T05:38:19.478800,Shawana,what error?
1443,2019-04-01T05:38:27.479100,Jannie,None
1443,2019-04-01T05:38:58.480500,Shawana,so you have to install django inside your virtual env :wink:

1443,2019-04-01T06:21:39.482600,Jannie,I didn't installed Django. Just installed djangorestframework
1443,2019-04-01T06:28:00.483800,Jannie,Do you mean I have to install djangorestframework and django both?

1446,2019-04-01T07:37:00.485100,Florencio,good morning
1446,2019-04-01T07:37:17.485500,Florencio,"how do I include  `static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)`"
1446,2019-04-01T07:37:52.486000,Florencio,"I already have this:
```

                  path('admin/', admin.site.urls),

1446,2019-04-01T07:38:33.486600,Florencio,"in settings, I have:
```
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

1446,2019-04-01T07:39:10.487100,Valeri,Where do you want to include it? And what do you mean by include?
1446,2019-04-01T07:40:19.487400,Valeri,<@Florencio>
1446,2019-04-01T07:40:54.487800,Florencio,add it to the `urlpatterns`
1446,2019-04-01T07:41:04.488000,Hiroko,so do it?
1446,2019-04-01T07:41:10.488500,Hiroko,:slightly_smiling_face:
1446,2019-04-01T07:41:37.489200,Hiroko,but be aware the above is just for development
1446,2019-04-01T07:41:38.489400,Florencio,"yeah did `urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)`"
1446,2019-04-01T07:41:41.489500,Hiroko,does not apply to deployment
1446,2019-04-01T07:41:51.489700,Florencio,wait what?
1446,2019-04-01T07:42:00.490000,Florencio,wait a minute
1446,2019-04-01T07:42:14.490700,Valeri,Yes that's a bad idea for prod
1446,2019-04-01T07:42:37.491200,Florencio,so how do i display the image uploaded?
1446,2019-04-01T07:42:54.491600,Florencio,an image uploaded goes to the `/media/`
1446,2019-04-01T07:43:04.491900,Florencio,so what am i supposed to do?
1446,2019-04-01T07:43:42.492600,Hiroko,"what the above does is let you use runserver, or the development django test server program, to easily let you work locally"
1446,2019-04-01T07:44:15.493400,Hiroko,"but using runserver in prod is a very bad idea, unless you really desire bad performance and wide open security doors"
1446,2019-04-01T07:45:40.495000,Hiroko,"so static and media files are best handled by either apache or nginx, which will route the requests to your media/static folders you define in that config, as well as pass your django requests to either gunicorn, mod_wsgi or uwsgi (depending on what you select)"
1446,2019-04-01T07:46:25.495500,Florencio,is that pronounced `En-gine-X`?
1446,2019-04-01T07:47:16.495700,Hiroko,<https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/11/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-django-part-2.html#views-templates-and-static-files>
1446,2019-04-01T07:47:58.496300,Hiroko,yes
1446,2019-04-01T07:52:51.497000,Florencio,lots of the examples only talk about one of the staticfiles which is `static`
1446,2019-04-01T07:53:06.497400,Florencio,so whatabout `media`?
1446,2019-04-01T07:53:38.498000,Florencio,like how do I take care of images uploaded by the user/admin?
1446,2019-04-01T07:54:02.498500,Florencio,"I tried adding it, had errors in `runserver`"
1446,2019-04-01T07:55:57.498900,Hiroko,<https://django.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.x/howto/static-files/#serving-files-uploaded-by-a-user-during-development>
1446,2019-04-01T07:59:05.499100,Florencio,sorry I saw that
1446,2019-04-01T07:59:28.499600,Florencio,"but my confusion is I also have static, so how do i add media?"
1446,2019-04-01T08:00:38.499900,Hiroko,"again, same way"
1446,2019-04-01T08:01:10.500700,Hiroko,"```urlpatterns = [
                  path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
              ] + static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
                 + static(MEDIA STUFF)```"
1446,2019-04-01T08:01:53.501500,Florencio,that looks weird
1446,2019-04-01T08:02:14.502000,Hiroko,"I’ve not done this in a while, to be honest"
1446,2019-04-01T08:02:19.502300,Hiroko,because I mainly use docker
1446,2019-04-01T08:02:34.503000,Hiroko,and everything’s containerized to replicate most of what prod has
1446,2019-04-01T08:04:23.504100,Hiroko,do you have logging?
1446,2019-04-01T08:04:40.504600,Hiroko,`print` won’t work in a number of situations with django
1446,2019-04-01T08:04:46.504900,Hiroko,so you really should use logging instead
1446,2019-04-01T08:05:02.505100,Hiroko,"also

```access = AppUserAccess.objects.create(
            app=app,
            user=user
        )```"
1446,2019-04-01T08:05:35.505900,Hiroko,"I really hope `app` and `user` are a composite unique pair, because otherwise you’re going to be having a _very_ big database table"
1446,2019-04-01T08:06:02.506400,Hiroko,I would use `get_or_create` instead
1446,2019-04-01T08:06:20.507100,Eliz,Yea we're not speaking of actual production content right now -- simply having the issue of getting 404s when adding (a) decorator
1446,2019-04-01T08:06:35.507400,Eliz,Thanks for the notice though
1446,2019-04-01T08:06:40.507700,Hiroko,404 means resource not found
1446,2019-04-01T08:06:49.508300,Hiroko,does it work without the decorator?
1446,2019-04-01T08:06:57.508800,Eliz,Yea
1446,2019-04-01T08:07:16.509300,Eliz,I have the feeling that it silently drops the route when there's an error or something

1446,2019-04-01T08:19:32.516500,Hiroko,I think you need to have at least `**kwargs` in the outer

1446,2019-04-01T08:37:52.521900,Dawn,"when getting values from nested objects in a dictionary, is there any best practice in terms of getting nested objects muiltple times? a bit vague, maybe this helps:
```
shirt = {
  id: 1,
  properties: {
    color: 'blue',
    size: 'L'
    }
}
```
Nest into properties twice:
`shirt_color = shirt.get('properties').get('color')`
`shirt_size = shirt.get('properties').get('size')`

Or get parent object once and then continue there:
`shirt_properties = shirt.get('properties')`
`shirt_size = shirt_properties.get('color')`
`shirt_size = shirt_properties.get('size')`

Or is there no difference?"
1446,2019-04-01T08:46:24.526800,Clemmie,"<@Dawn> a couple of answers - the latter might be ever so slightly more performant, as you are accessing `properties` only once. In this use case it is minimal, but with larger or deeper data it could impact you.  I would also be wary about missing keys - it can be handled in both of these cases, but they lend themselves to being handled differently - in the first case to `shirt.get('properties', {}).get('color',None)` the second more to wrapping the properties in a `try....except KeyError` and then not bothering to look up color and size, just setting them to None."
1446,2019-04-01T08:50:47.529700,Dawn,Thanks. Yeah i'm using this for ETL so i'll go for the more performant one. Using the replacement empty dict and None for the end value should be enough right?
1446,2019-04-01T08:51:18.530400,Clemmie,can you get that subprocess to print what it is calling? then you can debug the curl by hand and backpropagate to the correct call
1446,2019-04-01T08:52:32.530800,Clemmie,"Should be, if getting None for your terminal value when the intermediate key is missing is the correct behavior"
1446,2019-04-01T08:52:43.531100,Shawana,"it's calling : `curl <https://api.github.com/user/repos?access_token=&lt;m_token&gt;> -d ""{""name"": ""TESTPROJECT"", ""private"": true}""`"

1446,2019-04-01T09:05:29.534000,Melynda,Shelling out to curl seems a bit weird – why not just make the HTTP call from Python?
1446,2019-04-01T09:08:13.535300,Melynda,"If you must use `subprocess`, you might be better off passing `args` as ""a sequence of program arguments"" rather than fighting shell parsing semantics, too. `subprocess.call(['curl', url, '-d', json_data])` might work."
1446,2019-04-01T09:08:39.535500,Melynda,"&gt; Providing a sequence of arguments is generally preferred, as it allows the module to take care of any required escaping and quoting of arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file names). If passing a single string, either shell must be True (see below) or else the string must simply name the program to be executed without specifying any arguments."

1447,2019-04-01T08:02:54.503500,Eliz,"Hello there!

I have a rather simple (view) decorator which looks something like below:

```
def access_logger(view_function):
    @wraps(view_function)
    def wrap(request, *args, **kwargs):
        print(request)

        app = request.auth.application
        user = request.user

        access = AppUserAccess.objects.create(
            app=app,
            user=user
        )

        return view_function(request, *args, **kwargs)

    return wrap
```

And is implemented like:

```
@access_logger
class ArticleViewSet(ViewSetMixin):
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated, TokenIsWebservice, UserHasApp]
    serializer_class = ArticleSerializer
    model = Article
    pk_field = 'id'
```

When applying the <@Marvella>_logger decorator my call returns a 404.  I have a feeling that I am making a mistake in my decorator, but not totally sure how and/or what

Console doesn't return any errors as well"
1448,2019-04-01T08:49:37.529000,Shawana,"Hey,

I'm trying to create a github repo via cli inside python on windows with `subprocess.call(f'curl <https://api.github.com/user/repos?access_token={TOKEN}> -d ""{{\""name\"": \""{NEW}\"", \""private\"": {str(PRIVATE).lower()}}}""', shell=True)`

what I get back:
```
{
  ""message"": ""Problems parsing JSON"",
  ""documentation_url"": ""<https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create>""

Any ideas? In my point of view I followed the instructions in `<https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create>` detail ;-("
1449,2019-04-01T09:25:21.536000,Letty,"Also, why not use an existing python github API SDK? There’s a few, like this: <https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub>"
1449,2019-04-01T09:37:06.539900,Claudine,"Running into an annoying AWS API Gateway issue where they are transforming my XML response and it's killing my stuff.
API Gateway hits a lambda that returns this response, I have verified in CloudWatch logs that this is the exact response being returned:
```
&lt;Response&gt;
&lt;Transfer transferTo=""{redacted}""&gt;&lt;/Transfer&gt;
&lt;/Response&gt;
```
But when I hit the endpoint I see the following response:
```
&lt;Response&gt;
&lt;Transfer transferTo=""{redacted}""/&gt;
&lt;/Response&gt;
```
You'd think it wouldn't matter but the thing consuming that response requires the first format. Curious if anyone has ran into wonky API Gateway stuff"
1449,2019-04-01T09:50:56.540000,Dawn,"Hm I tried the shirt.get('properties', {}).get('color',None) method, and if there's no properties, it throws `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'`"
1449,2019-04-01T09:52:26.540400,Clemmie,I think that is actually saying that `shirt` is none. I tested the rest with an empyt dict and it worked fine
1449,2019-04-01T09:52:50.540900,Clemmie,Try removing the second `get` and see what happens
1449,2019-04-01T09:52:58.541400,Jonas,Technically the second one is correct I think?
1449,2019-04-01T09:54:26.541700,Claudine,i think they are both technically correct
1449,2019-04-01T09:54:45.542200,Claudine,the problem is that im sending this response to a 3rd party API and they apparently require the first format
1449,2019-04-01T09:55:50.543800,Melynda,"Both are indeed correct. That sucks that the third-party aren't using a valid XML parser, though. :confused:"
1449,2019-04-01T09:55:51.543900,Claudine,"i have logging in the lambda generating this response and I can see it is generating the first format, but it seems like API Gateway transforms it to the second format"
1449,2019-04-01T09:55:58.544100,Claudine,yea indeed it does
1449,2019-04-01T09:56:23.544700,Claudine,I have to demo functionality in 5 hours so i don't have enough time to tell them to fix their stuff haha

1449,2019-04-01T10:07:51.547900,Clemmie,"that said, you almost certainly need to edit your `pg_hba.conf`"
1449,2019-04-01T10:21:43.550700,Claudine,"<@Melynda> :taco:  i'll give you one for the clever thought, ultimately the error was something else but your suggestion led me to the issue"
1449,2019-04-01T10:22:39.551800,Claudine,"turns out their XML parser is fine, the issue was that they hit our endpoint for a response multiple times for different ""event_types"", and we were returning that response for the wrong ""event_type"""
1449,2019-04-01T10:23:48.552900,Claudine,pretty much everytime i blame someone else for doing something weird i eventually realize the error was my fault or my misunderstanding

1449,2019-04-01T10:26:49.555700,Claudine,i blame spotty documentation for most misunderstanding and the log for most solutions
1449,2019-04-01T10:26:55.555900,Claudine,log is god

1455,2019-04-01T15:02:44.007300,Carmen,No reason for Django to reimplement that when Requests is as good as it is.
1455,2019-04-01T15:03:05.007700,Lawrence,yah I was going to use requests but was not sure if there was a way to do this with Django that was more conventional

1456,2019-04-01T15:30:06.010100,Nenita,any work around other than writing another function?
1456,2019-04-01T15:32:44.011100,Nenita,i guess the lazy way would be renaming the __init__ to something else
1456,2019-04-01T15:32:48.011300,Sasha,"Need some more context there... normally an `__init__()` routine doesn't return anything, since it's just operating on `self`."
1456,2019-04-01T15:33:25.011900,Nenita,"yea, ill just rename the function because thankfully, i just used __init__ as a beginning procedure for my class"
1456,2019-04-01T15:33:36.012200,Nenita,but renaming it wont affect anything
1456,2019-04-01T15:34:36.012900,Sasha,"Yeah, renaming is smart. You don't want to use dunder methods for non-standard uses, since they'll get called when you don't want them to."
1456,2019-04-01T15:35:18.013600,Nenita,renaming __init__ to inialize seems to do justice just fine haha
1456,2019-04-01T15:35:25.013800,Nenita,*initialize
1456,2019-04-01T15:42:51.014500,Nenita,"so after renameing that function, i cannot call another function using self, but rather typing out the class name then function name. is there a reason for this? if so, i cannot figure it out."
1456,2019-04-01T15:43:58.014700,Nenita,'Invoices' object has no attribute 'AdjustCx'
1456,2019-04-01T15:45:43.015400,Nenita,"yea, i had to use ConnectQB.AdjustCx rather than self.AdjustCx"
1456,2019-04-01T15:48:29.016500,Sasha,"If you don't have an `__init__` method anymore, are your instance attributes being initialized anywhere?"
1456,2019-04-01T15:49:26.017100,Carlo,<@Virgie> you're thinking of <@Claudine> but post your problem :stuck_out_tongue:
1456,2019-04-01T15:51:18.018900,Virgie,"I have some json-formatted data within a non-json file (there are other ascii content within). I’m trying to parse out the json content with python’s regular expressions.

1456,2019-04-01T15:51:24.019100,Virgie,for instance:

1456,2019-04-01T15:57:27.025600,Claudine,does `re.MULTILINE` do anything for you instead of `re.S`?
1456,2019-04-01T15:58:06.026200,Virgie,"unfortunately not. I tried that, and both ( `re.M | re.S` ), and neither worked"
1456,2019-04-01T15:58:55.026400,Claudine,`\{.*|\n\}` that do anything for ya?
1456,2019-04-01T16:01:03.026600,Virgie,negative =/
1456,2019-04-01T16:03:25.027300,Claudine,how about this bad larry? `{[^}]*`
1456,2019-04-01T16:03:56.027700,Claudine,"that should match an opening brace, and then everything else that is not a closing brace"
1456,2019-04-01T16:04:06.028000,Claudine,if there is a stray closing brace in your file it will jack up the regex
1456,2019-04-01T16:04:57.028400,Claudine,you can pop an extra `}` on the end if you want to capture the braces
1456,2019-04-01T16:05:46.028700,Claudine,*hungrily awaits taco*
1456,2019-04-01T16:06:14.029000,Virgie,"here you are, sir"
1456,2019-04-01T16:06:44.029600,Virgie,that worked! :raised_hands:

1456,2019-04-01T16:08:10.032600,Claudine,perfect thanks
1456,2019-04-01T16:08:18.032900,Virgie,I’ll squanch a taco at yu any time. much appreciated!
1456,2019-04-01T16:08:32.033200,Claudine,"i'll squanch your regexes anytime, you're quite welcome"
1456,2019-04-01T16:09:02.033600,Virgie,"actually, if you don’t quite mind helping me understand that regex you gave me…"
1456,2019-04-01T16:09:36.033800,Claudine,sure
1456,2019-04-01T16:11:32.036100,Claudine,"`{[^}]*`
the first character is  `{`, so that will match your opening curly brace
this is followed by a character group `[]`, but those `[` `]` have things inside them
the things inside are `^}`, inside a character group `^` is a negation and `}` is the character being negating, so this character group matches any character that is not a `}` (including newlines)
and then we have `*` at the end, which means match as many of the previous negation as possible"
1456,2019-04-01T16:11:52.036600,Claudine,then eventually we hit your closing `}` which terminations the previous matchy bit there
1456,2019-04-01T16:12:35.037500,Claudine,so like `[a]` will match one lower case `a` [^a]` will match anything that isn't a lowercase `a`
1456,2019-04-01T16:12:43.037900,Virgie,"ahhh, okay. dsylexia makes regex a headache to read correctly :facepalm:"
1456,2019-04-01T16:12:52.038200,Claudine,if you wanted to match anything that is not a digit you could do `[^0-9]`
1456,2019-04-01T16:13:13.038900,Claudine,haha yea i could see that making it much harder than it already is
1456,2019-04-01T16:13:16.039100,Virgie,"I was reading the braces and brackets as their actual regex interpretations for grouping, instead of their literals"
1456,2019-04-01T16:13:38.039400,Claudine,ahh yea that can get dicey
1456,2019-04-01T16:14:03.039900,Virgie,"oh well. that’s cleared up, so another is in order"
1456,2019-04-01T16:14:12.040200,Virgie,<@Claudine> :taco:
1456,2019-04-01T16:15:42.040600,Virgie,thanks again! very clever regex :wink:
1456,2019-04-01T16:16:34.041400,Claudine,no problem! the only thing i'd be worried about is if the contents of your file happens to have another `}` somewhere in it because it'd cut the match of there
1456,2019-04-01T16:17:45.042000,Virgie,"it’s unlikely, but certainly possible. it’ll be noticeable if it does, and I’ll address it then."
1457,2019-04-01T15:47:52.015800,Virgie,where’s the guy who loves regex? I’m having some trouble.
1457,2019-04-01T15:49:52.017400,Virgie,"ahhh, thank you <@Carlo>"
1457,2019-04-01T15:52:55.020900,Hiroko,why do you have a mixed-format file?

1458,2019-04-01T16:02:12.027000,Sasha,Do you need a raw string for the backslashes?
1459,2019-04-01T17:19:12.045300,Kathline,"Hey all, I'm having issues with handling csv files. the problem is that the delimiter and the lineterminator uses the same character(';'). I'm using the lineterminator argument from pandas.to_csv to append the rows with a ';'. This is done so that the column count of two files are equal(one was missing ; at the end and therefore didn't count as column)"
1459,2019-04-01T17:20:07.046700,Bethany,Do you know ahead of time the number of columns?
1459,2019-04-01T17:20:12.047000,Kathline,yes
1459,2019-04-01T17:21:37.048200,Bethany,You could split on `;` and reshape the resulting list since you know what the shape should be
1459,2019-04-01T17:22:17.049100,Bethany,But there's no line ending character `\n`?
1459,2019-04-01T17:24:44.051500,Kathline,"alright, thanks I will look into that.  there isn't a line ending character as it's a excel file converted into a csv using pandas(it looked easier to use and flexible)"
1459,2019-04-01T17:25:31.052400,Sasha,"In the original `to_csv()`, can you use `"";\n""` as the line terminator?"
1459,2019-04-01T17:29:45.053700,Kathline,"<@Sasha>, <@Bethany>.  ':\n' worked, didn't know you could use regex as line terminator. Thank you :smile:"
1459,2019-04-01T17:30:11.054000,Sasha,"It's not a regex, just a multi-character string."
1459,2019-04-01T17:32:18.054800,Genesis,Hello
1460,2019-04-01T17:32:10.054400,Claudine,HELLO!?!?!?
1460,2019-04-01T17:32:42.055400,Sasha,"False alarm, sorry <@Claudine>"
1460,2019-04-01T17:41:37.055900,Claudine,Haha no worries
1460,2019-04-02T00:38:05.061400,Sasha,"It's not completely clear what you want. What data should be associated with partition 0? From the example, it looks like you just want the two broker entries in the first entry of the replicas list. So I'm not sure why you're trying to zip across records."
1461,2019-04-01T20:09:20.058300,Clemmie,:joy: The amount I laughed at that says a lot about me
1461,2019-04-01T20:10:50.058800,Sparkle,"note - excel new lines are either `\r\n` or `\n\r` i cant remember which order - but those 2 together make a hard csv new line row
in weird cases i have also seen `\m` which is damn near invisible unless you view it on terminal lol and has been known to throw wrenches on occasion :face_with_rolling_eyes:"
1462,2019-04-01T21:28:25.059500,Stacy,"Hello.  I have a list that contains data like this:

```
[{'broker': 0, 'leader': True, 'in_sync': True}, {'broker': 1, 'leader': False, 'in_sync': True}]
[{'broker': 1, 'leader': True, 'in_sync': True}, {'broker': 2, 'leader': False, 'in_sync': True}]
[{'broker': 2, 'leader': True, 'in_sync': True}, {'broker': 0, 'leader': False, 'in_sync': True}]
```
That data above is generated by this:  `broker = [ x[i]['broker'] for x in lc_replicas ]`

My output code is like so:

```
lc_partitions = [ p['partition'] for p in output['partitions'] ]
lc_leader = [ l['leader'] for l in output['partitions'] ]
lc_replicas = [ r['replicas'] for r in output['partitions'] ]

for i in range(slice):
    print(i)
    broker = [ x[i]['broker'] for x in lc_replicas ]
    leader = [ x[i]['leader'] for x in lc_replicas ]
    in_sync = [ x[i]['in_sync'] for x in lc_replicas ]

    for lc_p,lc_l,b,l,i in zip(lc_partitions, lc_leader, broker, leader, in_sync):
        print('Partitions: Partition - {0} Leader - {1} Replicas: Broker - {2} Leader - {3} In_Sync - {4}'.format(lc_p, lc_l, b, l, i))
```

The issue is that it prints the formatted data for each loop, when I only want to print part of the output once, and concatenate/zip/? the replica data (which requires the looping, at least how I'm doing it currently) to each Partitions line.  So it currently does this:

```
0 #loop count
Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0 Replicas: Broker - 0 Leader - True In_Sync - True
Partitions: Partition - 1 Leader - 1 Replicas: Broker - 1 Leader - True In_Sync - True
Partitions: Partition - 2 Leader - 2 Replicas: Broker - 2 Leader - True In_Sync - True
```

```
1 #loop
Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0 Replicas: Broker - 1 Leader - False In_Sync - True
Partitions: Partition - 1 Leader - 1 Replicas: Broker - 2 Leader - False In_Sync - True
Partitions: Partition - 2 Leader - 2 Replicas: Broker - 0 Leader - False In_Sync - True
```

I want the lines to look like this:

`Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0 Replicas: Broker - 0 Leader - True In_Sync - True, Broker - 1 Leader - False In_Sync - True`
`Partitions: Partition - 1 Leader - 1 Replicas: Broker - 1 Leader - True In_Sync - True, Broker - 2 Leader - False In_Sync - True`
`Partitions: Partition - 2 Leader - 2 Replicas: Broker - 2 Leader - True In_Sync - True, Broker - 0 Leader - False In_Sync - True`

Hopefully this makes sense."
1462,2019-04-02T00:47:10.065800,Stacy,"<@Sasha> so the lines that i want it to look like combine sections of both loop 0 and loop1 because `lc_replicas` contains two dictionaries within one list, so I have to loop through those keys with these:

```
    broker = [ x[i]['broker'] for x in lc_replicas ]
    leader = [ x[i]['leader'] for x in lc_replicas ]
    in_sync = [ x[i]['in_sync'] for x in lc_replicas ]
```
I'm doing this because I believe these show the results of partitions that have 2 replicas - it could be 1 to 3 so I'm trying to take that into account, in which case the line i want it to look like could potentially be  `Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0 Replicas: Broker - 0 Leader - True In_Sync - True, Broker - 1 Leader - False In_Sync - True, ****Broker - 2, Leader - False, In_Sync - True****` where the third loop adds the content contained within asterisks.  Does that help?  Without the loops the output would simply be `Partitions: Partition - 0 Leader - 0` which requires no loops, just a matter of zipping the results together so they match up."
1462,2019-04-02T00:48:13.066400,Stacy,I basically want to concat the content from the loops of the dictionaries together so they're contained on the same line when I zip everything together.
1462,2019-04-02T00:49:06.066800,Sasha,From your original list:
1462,2019-04-02T00:49:18.067300,Stacy,i'm not sure if leveraging itertools / chain would help in this case.  haven't used it before.
1462,2019-04-02T00:56:45.072700,Stacy,"so there's a total of 47 partitions total (contained within `lc_partitions = [ p['partition'] for p in output['partitions'] ]` - i only need to loop those once.  the way the current code works is it adds the replicas details to the partitions in two separate loops because i'm looping broker/leader/in_sync list comprehensions twice in this example....it could potentially be 1-3.  so in the snippets where it shows `#loop 0`, it goes from 0 to 47, with the first slice/element of dictionaries in the list :

```
    broker = [ x[i]['broker'] for x in lc_replicas ]
    leader = [ x[i]['leader'] for x in lc_replicas ]
    in_sync = [ x[i]['in_sync'] for x in lc_replicas ]
```

loop 1 then goes through partitions 0-47 again, appending the second element of the list. i want both `x[0]['broker'],x[0]['leader'],x[0]['in_sync'] and x[1]['broker'],x[1]['leader'],x[1]['in_sync']` printed on the same line."
1462,2019-04-02T00:57:48.073500,Sasha,"Let me sketch out what I think you want, and you correct me... Give me a sec."
1462,2019-04-02T00:59:12.074700,Stacy,"i'm probably complicating by just doing snippets vs the whole thing, i can try to provide more if that would help"
1462,2019-04-02T01:01:44.074800,Sasha,"I think you just want a nested loop like this, if I understand which data you want where."
1462,2019-04-02T01:03:12.075600,Sasha,"Doesn't do the commas correctly, but meh, you get the idea."
1462,2019-04-02T01:07:03.075900,Stacy,Yes!!!!!
1462,2019-04-02T01:08:39.076700,Stacy,"Ok, so this strips out the need of me needing to my slice logic to take into account how many dictionaries there might be in the replicas because well....it's already provided.  That's apparent now"
1462,2019-04-02T01:09:49.077500,Stacy,"i knew at some point i'd have to end with a space in attempt to concat the two lines together also.  i had this commented out from previous troubleshooting `#print(lc_p, lc_l, l, b, i, end=' ')`"
1462,2019-04-02T01:10:28.077800,Stacy,my confusion was how to iterate those dictionaries within the replicas list.
1462,2019-04-02T01:11:05.078600,Stacy,this is great.  thank you <@Sasha> at some point i'm going to have to buy you beers instead of tacos (if you're in to that.)  :slightly_smiling_face:
1462,2019-04-02T01:12:04.079300,Sasha,"Heh, no problem. Happy to help, and glad it wasn't as complicated as it seemed."
1462,2019-04-02T01:13:09.080000,Stacy,still getting a hang of python data structures.  i always seem to over complicate it and have to strip things down.. need to quit making things so hard.
1462,2019-04-02T01:16:07.080700,Stacy,can't wait till rhel8 when i can start using f-strings all the time.  using .format to be compatible on my servers for now.
1462,2019-04-02T01:19:17.081600,Sasha,"Sure, go for it."
1462,2019-04-02T01:20:26.082100,Demetrice,So i'm trying to help a friend with a coding challenge. and i realized that i can't quite conceptualize it myself
1462,2019-04-02T01:21:03.082300,Demetrice,None
1462,2019-04-02T01:22:12.083500,Demetrice,So i first i thought it would just be a series of if statements and that would be simple enough. But then i realized it will probably incorporate some concepts i'm not familiar with
1462,2019-04-02T01:23:36.084100,Demetrice,I mean i don't actually have to write it. Just conceptualizing it successfully is the goal.
1462,2019-04-02T01:23:44.084400,Demetrice,If it's too long to read i can do a tl;dr
1462,2019-04-02T01:26:43.086800,Sasha,"I understand the problem, but it's not immediately obvious how to solve it. My first point of slight confusion is even to figure out what the brackets look like for tournaments that don't have a power-of-two number of teams, since some teams will have to skip a round, and maybe we want our favored team to do that."
1462,2019-04-02T01:27:59.088300,Demetrice,I thought the implication was that there's any number of teams
1462,2019-04-02T01:28:11.088800,Demetrice,but i don't think odd numbers are allowed. I think it has to be a logical bracket
1462,2019-04-02T01:28:15.089000,Sasha,"For our team to advance to a slot in the bracket, it will have to be the highest-ranked team in that subtree, but the exact ordering of other teams doesn't matter within that tree."
1462,2019-04-02T01:28:22.089300,Demetrice,"I mean that's an assumption, but i don't know how that wouldn't be the case"
1462,2019-04-02T01:28:33.089600,Demetrice,Ohh you're right
1462,2019-04-02T01:28:46.090000,Demetrice,You know i've been trying to make the bracket from the bottom up
1462,2019-04-02T01:29:01.090600,Demetrice,But i think just &gt; statements might work?
1462,2019-04-02T01:29:08.090800,Demetrice,I'm not sure
1462,2019-04-02T01:29:13.091000,Demetrice,No it's not that easy. Hmm
1462,2019-04-02T01:32:56.093800,Sasha,"Waaaait... in the pasted text, it says ""2N"" teams. Is that actually ""2^N"" with an exponent?"
1462,2019-04-02T01:33:08.094000,Demetrice,So i was thinking and i'm not sure if this makes sense but i was thinking we'd want to try to sort it top to bottom x number of times
1462,2019-04-02T01:34:30.094400,Demetrice,Yeah it pastes 2N but it's actually 2^N
1462,2019-04-02T01:34:56.094800,Sasha,"Okay, that's much easier, so we have a complete tree, with no skipped rounds."
1462,2019-04-02T01:35:33.095500,Demetrice,I can't tell if it's easy or hard. Would we want to try to sort it? How would you approach this?
1462,2019-04-02T01:36:36.096800,Sasha,"We know that if our team is the lowest ranked, it wins 0 rounds. If there is at least 1 lower-ranked team, it wins 1 round. If there are 3 lower-ranked teams, it can win 2 rounds. If there are 7 lower-ranked teams, it can win 3 rounds, etc."
1462,2019-04-02T01:37:00.097300,Demetrice,"Okay, i didn't think of it in that way"
1462,2019-04-02T01:37:48.098100,Sasha,"So all you have to do is put our team in the first slot, put all the lower-ranked teams in the next slots, and then fill the rest with the higher-ranked teams."
1462,2019-04-02T01:38:19.098400,Demetrice,Huh
1462,2019-04-02T01:38:27.098700,Demetrice,Yeah i mean that makes sense conceptually
1462,2019-04-02T01:38:55.099000,Demetrice,Wait no that actually makes sense
1462,2019-04-02T01:39:07.099400,Demetrice,So you just arrange the teams in order of weakest to strongest
1462,2019-04-02T01:39:16.099700,Demetrice,Place are team in the first slot and then fill out the bracket?
1462,2019-04-02T01:40:48.100700,Demetrice,*** our
1462,2019-04-02T01:41:21.101300,Sasha,"Yep, that seems to be a sufficient solution. The code would basically just be a print loop with an if or two."
1462,2019-04-02T01:42:12.102100,Demetrice,So we're just ordering the teams from weakest to strongest. bumping ours to the front slot and then printing the result?
1462,2019-04-02T01:42:13.102400,Demetrice,That's it?
1462,2019-04-02T01:42:50.102800,Sasha,"Pretty much, yep. Unless someone sees something we're missing about the problem."
1462,2019-04-02T01:43:50.103200,Demetrice,My friend asks what if we wanted to make the bracket random
1462,2019-04-02T01:44:04.103600,Demetrice,Which isn't actually a requirement but would probably make it significantly harder
1462,2019-04-02T01:44:35.104000,Sasha,"I don't quite understand. If it's random, we don't have any choice."
1462,2019-04-02T01:45:57.104200,Demetrice,Well maybe not random
1462,2019-04-02T01:46:17.104800,Demetrice,"But not as ordered as our team, weakest -&gt; strongest"
1462,2019-04-02T01:46:35.105200,Demetrice,Not random i guess just disorganized. to mimic an actual bracket
1462,2019-04-02T01:49:09.106300,Sasha,"You can definitely scramble up the teams and still get the same result, as long as there are at least 2^m - 1 weaker teams in our team's tree (for winning m rounds)."
1462,2019-04-02T01:50:02.106700,Demetrice,"Okay, i think i understand the simple solution pretty well conceptually"
1462,2019-04-02T01:50:25.107200,Demetrice,But i wouldn't know how to conceptualize how to solve a the problem to get the scrambled version
1462,2019-04-02T01:50:34.107400,Demetrice,"That would be significantly harder, right?"
1462,2019-04-02T01:52:26.108800,Sasha,"Not necessarily. Step 1 would be to figure out how many rounds your team is supposed to win. Then you can fill out his nearby bracket with any random choice of 2^m - 1 out of the weaker teams. And then fill the rest of the brackets randomly from whoever is left, stronger or weaker."
1462,2019-04-02T01:54:21.109800,Demetrice,I think i'm almost there. I'm just struggling conceptualizing it because it scales so hard
1462,2019-04-02T01:54:39.110100,Demetrice,if there's 100 rounds and we're supposed to win 40
1462,2019-04-02T01:55:08.110500,Demetrice,Then that would be err a lot of local brackets to fill out
1462,2019-04-02T01:55:15.110800,Demetrice,Maybe there's a simple way to account for that that i'm not thinking of
1462,2019-04-02T01:56:21.111800,Sasha,"Well, there's no way around that if you have 100 rounds... that's 2^100, or about 10^30, a really astronomical-sized tournament."
1462,2019-04-02T01:57:25.112200,Demetrice,lol somehow a tournament with more team's that humans on the planet
1462,2019-04-02T01:57:31.112400,Demetrice,Maybe it's a universal tournament
1462,2019-04-02T01:57:38.112700,Demetrice,Okay so maybe not 100 but say there's 10
1462,2019-04-02T01:57:42.113000,Demetrice,and we're supposed to win 8
1462,2019-04-02T01:57:51.113200,Sasha,"""Pick the best atom on the planet!"""
1462,2019-04-02T01:57:58.113400,Demetrice,lol
1462,2019-04-02T01:58:09.113800,Demetrice,"That's 64 ""local"" Teams to assign"
1462,2019-04-02T01:58:23.114200,Demetrice,as opposed to another example when there's only 2 if we're only winning one game
1462,2019-04-02T01:58:48.115000,Demetrice,How do i account for that level of variance. The more i think about it the more i think there's probably a pretty easy way to write it.
1462,2019-04-02T01:59:27.115800,Sasha,"Yep. The more rounds you want to ""fix"", the more control you have to have over the brackets. But the problem as stated has you printing out all the brackets anyway, so it's the same amount of work either way, more or less."
1462,2019-04-02T02:00:36.116500,Demetrice,So when i know how many rounds our team should be winning just need put that many teams in the first x spaces and then randomize it? I suppose
1462,2019-04-02T02:00:54.116900,Demetrice,So if we're winning 3 rounds i'm only concerning myself with the first 8 entries and so on and so forth
1462,2019-04-02T02:01:04.117200,Demetrice,There's a lot of this that i can't write but i think i understand it for the most part now
1462,2019-04-02T02:01:22.117400,Sasha,Yep
1462,2019-04-02T02:02:02.118400,Demetrice,:taco: <@Sasha> Make that a mega Taco
1462,2019-04-02T02:02:04.118600,Sasha,"And if there are, say, 12 lower-ranked teams, you can pick any 7 of them."
1462,2019-04-02T02:02:16.119000,Demetrice,"I don't know why you never sleep, but i'm not complaining about it"
1462,2019-04-02T02:02:56.119600,Sasha,"Heh, I do, but I'm a couple of time-zones westward, so it's not as late here."
1462,2019-04-02T02:30:17.120400,Demetrice,At least the simple version anyway
1463,2019-04-02T01:18:33.081300,Demetrice,"Oh hey <@Sasha> I'm trying to understand a problem conceptually, could we talk through it?"
1464,2019-04-02T02:30:14.120200,Demetrice,You know i think i'm going to try to write it. I'm curious
1464,2019-04-02T03:08:07.120800,Demetrice,So how does this look so far
1464,2019-04-02T03:08:15.121000,Demetrice,None
1464,2019-04-02T03:22:07.122300,Demetrice,<@Sasha> I'm not sure if you're still around. But i think i just need help on the last step
1464,2019-04-02T03:30:09.123400,Sasha,"Cool, I like the remove-and-append, very elegant. For the last step you just need to print them out in pairs. One easy way to do that would be to use `range()` with a step size of 2."
1464,2019-04-02T03:31:48.123800,Demetrice,Trying to figure out how to print it in pairs has me stumped

1464,2019-04-02T03:32:59.125100,Demetrice,It's a for statement and i'm leveraging the range function taking 3 parameters. But i can't put it all together in my head
1464,2019-04-02T03:34:27.125900,Sasha,"I'll give you a hint. You want to print out Teams[0]-Teams[1], then Teams[2]-Teams[3], etc. So if the range is giving you 0, 2, 4, etc..."
1464,2019-04-02T03:35:09.126900,Maegan,"<@Demetrice> this should help you out, in a loop mention the start and end bound and you should have multiple lists that can be `join()`ed with a `-`

1464,2019-04-02T03:35:35.127100,Demetrice,I tried This. Which was wrong. I'm sure this is simple but it's 2:30 am. Just give me a sec
1464,2019-04-02T03:35:53.127500,Maegan,seems  it is your homework?
1464,2019-04-02T03:36:25.128100,Demetrice,No it's not homework. I was initially just doing research for a friend. But now i just want to complete it for pride
1464,2019-04-02T03:47:17.129200,Demetrice,My brain hurts. This shouldn't be so difficult
1464,2019-04-02T03:49:31.130500,Russ,"Given that `l = [%your_list_from_#random_channel%]` this would print elements in pairs:
```
for elem in range(1, len(l), 2):
    print(f'{elem}-{l[l.index(elem) + 1]}')
```
Note that you need to sort the list first, otherwise you'll have `7-9` and then `9-10`"
1464,2019-04-02T03:52:14.131000,Russ,But I feel that's some kind of hack and it will break easily...
1464,2019-04-02T03:52:52.131400,Sasha,"Yeah, there's some back-story to the list indicating why you don't want to sort it."
1464,2019-04-02T03:53:43.132200,Demetrice,I don't know if i'm missing something obvious or if this is legitimately hard. But it i just applied and if statement and used the range properly this would be done
1464,2019-04-02T03:55:11.133800,Sasha,"Here's another hint... if you wanted to print out ""10-11, 20-21, 30-31"" and I gave you 10, 20, 30 from the range() function, how would you attack that?"
1464,2019-04-02T03:56:50.135000,Russ,"How about this?
```
for idx, elem in enumerate(l):
    if idx % 2 == 0:
        print(f'{elem}-{l[idx+1]}')
```"
1464,2019-04-02T04:00:28.135400,Sasha,"That would work, <@Russ>"
1464,2019-04-02T04:04:06.135600,Demetrice,"for i in range (1,NumTeams,2):
        print (i, i+1)"
1464,2019-04-02T04:04:17.135900,Demetrice,I think i'm getting further away from a right answer
1464,2019-04-02T04:05:40.136500,Sasha,"Nope, you're super close. Now how do you get from `i` to the `i`th team in your list?"
1464,2019-04-02T04:11:31.137000,Demetrice,"I tried replacing the , with :  and - neither worked"
1464,2019-04-02T04:11:36.137200,Demetrice,I should probably just sleep on it
1464,2019-04-02T04:12:49.137700,Sasha,Probably wise. I expect it'll just make complete sense with a fresh look tomorrow.

1466,2019-04-02T07:17:37.150100,Chuck,"<@Antoine> This part -- `([i, n//i] for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1) if n % i == 0))` -- is called a generator expression. It creates a generator that will yield (in this case) a list object containing discovered factors of the value you pass to the function (stored in `n`). The specific part you mention -- `if n % i == 0` is performing a modulo operation on the number you passed in and the integer currently being tested. Modulo tests whether the right argument divides into the left argument evenly or not."

1468,2019-04-02T07:18:57.151300,Hiroko,I and others here can recognize what you’re asking because we know it.  but I imaginemany others are having WTH moments trying to figure what you’re asking
1468,2019-04-02T07:19:16.151700,Hiroko,especially without any kind of context
1468,2019-04-02T07:19:44.152200,Hiroko,"would be a very different story if you prefaced it with “in django, ….”"
1468,2019-04-02T07:20:23.153000,Hiroko,"we’re not mindreaders, unfortunately"
1468,2019-04-02T07:31:07.154200,Valeri,I've looked it up on the internet. Still clueless :confused:
1468,2019-04-02T07:32:22.154400,Hiroko,with django?
1468,2019-04-02T07:32:28.154700,Hiroko,you can do it with a command
1468,2019-04-02T07:32:44.155400,Hiroko,"but otherwise, why not replicate how your task executes?"
1468,2019-04-02T07:33:02.156100,Hiroko,"eg ```from module.tasks import Task

task.apply_async(...)```"
1468,2019-04-02T07:33:21.156500,Valeri,I don't have a module.tasks file
1468,2019-04-02T07:33:31.156800,Valeri,"```
book_addition_pool.apply_async(
                self._add_books,

                    book_list[start_index:start_index+maximum_batch_size],
                    maximum_batch_size
                )
            )
```"
1468,2019-04-02T07:33:51.157300,Valeri,This adds a task to my celery queue called `create_books`
1468,2019-04-02T07:33:59.157700,Hiroko,what is `_add_books`?
1468,2019-04-02T07:34:13.158300,Hiroko,"anyway, that does look _really_ convoluted"
1468,2019-04-02T07:34:15.158600,Valeri,It's a function doing the bulk_create
1468,2019-04-02T07:34:17.158700,Hiroko,and must be a pain to test
1468,2019-04-02T07:34:36.159000,Valeri,How do you suggest I simplify this?
1468,2019-04-02T07:35:01.159600,Valeri,Basically I have to do an asynchronous `bulk_create`
1468,2019-04-02T07:35:21.160400,Valeri,The API literally dies for records more than 50k
1468,2019-04-02T07:35:48.160900,Hiroko,what’s the problem there?
1468,2019-04-02T07:35:55.161300,Hiroko,is it the db?
1468,2019-04-02T07:35:56.161500,Hiroko,broker?
1468,2019-04-02T07:36:00.161700,Hiroko,worker?
1468,2019-04-02T07:36:01.161800,Valeri,The serializer is heavy
1468,2019-04-02T07:36:16.162100,Valeri,Has very complex business logic involved
1468,2019-04-02T07:36:26.162300,Hiroko,gotcha
1468,2019-04-02T07:38:01.163100,Hiroko,but what do you mean “the api literally dies for records more than 50k”?
1468,2019-04-02T07:38:10.163400,Hiroko,do you mean inserts?
1468,2019-04-02T07:38:23.163800,Hiroko,"retrievals (if so, why aren’t you using pagination?)"
1468,2019-04-02T07:38:38.164100,Valeri,Creation takes time
1468,2019-04-02T07:38:48.164400,Valeri,Retrieval is paginated ofc
1468,2019-04-02T07:39:06.164900,Hiroko,you’d be surprised at how many people don’t do that
1468,2019-04-02T07:39:34.165600,Hiroko,where’s the bottleneck?
1468,2019-04-02T07:39:37.165800,Hiroko,is it your db?
1468,2019-04-02T07:39:47.166200,Hiroko,your celery broker?
1468,2019-04-02T07:40:26.167000,Valeri,I think you're missing the point here
1468,2019-04-02T07:40:39.167300,Valeri,I have to get this done asynchronously
1468,2019-04-02T07:40:53.167700,Hiroko,and celery will do that for you
1468,2019-04-02T07:40:55.167900,Valeri,There is no way I can improve my API's performance
1468,2019-04-02T07:41:16.168200,Valeri,"So, I wasn't using celery until now"
1468,2019-04-02T07:41:23.168600,Hiroko,ahhhhh
1468,2019-04-02T07:41:24.168800,Hiroko,ok
1468,2019-04-02T07:43:00.169200,Hiroko,"so, executing a celery task in the command line is the same you’d do in a view"
1468,2019-04-02T07:43:26.169700,Hiroko,best praactices is to have the task defined in a `tasks.py` file
1468,2019-04-02T07:43:32.169900,Hiroko,where you can import it
1468,2019-04-02T07:43:44.170200,Hiroko,and then generate the data you need to execute said task
1468,2019-04-02T07:44:43.171400,Hiroko,"in this case, you’d have to figure out what the response for `self._add_books`, `book_list`, and `maximum_batch_size` are"
1469,2019-04-02T09:01:35.171900,Antoine,Thank you so much! I did some test trying the generator expression and now I understand better :smile:
1470,2019-04-02T09:37:59.172500,Kathline,"<@Sparkle> Thanks for your reply :slightly_smiling_face: . I was able to fix this by using '\n;' as line_terminator and ';'as delimiter. the whole issue was caused by using ; as delimiter and ; as line_terminator, which resulted in a very long line of data. where did you find these expressions?"
1471,2019-04-02T09:49:20.175100,Lawrence,"Flask Restful question: I am receiving a  404 when I use `<http://requests.post|requests.post>()` but a 200 when I `curl` the endpoint. My endpoint in Flask is as follows.
```class Endpoint(Resource):
    def post(self, call):
        print(call)
        return 200```
I set up my Resource as follows. ```api.add_resource(Endpoint, ""/&lt;call&gt;"") ``` So, this works `curl -X POST 127.0.0.1:5000/Hi` but this returns a 404 `r = <http://requests.post|requests.post>(ENDPOINT, json=payload_dict)` where ENDPOINT is <http://127.0.0.1:5000>"
1471,2019-04-02T09:50:18.175500,Lawrence,I've also tried replacing the `json` param with `data` to no avail
1471,2019-04-02T09:52:54.176800,Hiroko,what’s your payload dict?
1471,2019-04-02T09:53:00.177100,Carmen,This seems like a POST data vs URL params issue.
1471,2019-04-02T09:53:02.177300,Hiroko,a 400 is a bad request
1471,2019-04-02T09:53:21.178100,Lawrence,payload dict is kust a key:value dictionary
1471,2019-04-02T09:53:22.178400,Carmen,Your URL for the `requests` call isn't matching your Flask route.
1471,2019-04-02T09:53:32.178900,Lawrence,I'm able to print it out just fine - it looks correctly formatted
1471,2019-04-02T09:53:34.179000,Hiroko,```127.0.0.1:5000/Hi``` suggests this is a route
1471,2019-04-02T09:53:34.179100,Carmen,POST does not put the parameters in the URL.
1471,2019-04-02T09:54:02.179900,Lawrence,<@Hiroko> Hi is the `&lt;call&gt;` variable in this case
1471,2019-04-02T09:54:17.180500,Lawrence,<@Carmen> I believe you are right but I can't determine the proper route format
1471,2019-04-02T09:55:17.181500,Carmen,"So when you're using `ENDPOINT = <http://127.0.0.1:5000>`, you're making a call to that specific URL with POST data. You need to either modify `ENDPOINT` to have the `call` URL parameter, or adjust your route in Flask to not require it and instead to pull that data from the request POST data."
1471,2019-04-02T09:55:55.181900,Lawrence,ah I see
1471,2019-04-02T09:56:08.182400,Carmen,Which you do depends on whether `call` is something that you were specifying in your payload or not.
1471,2019-04-02T09:56:18.182700,Lawrence,so `ENDPOINT = ...:5000/?call=`?
1471,2019-04-02T09:56:37.183000,Carmen,Just `ENDPOINT = <http://127.0.0.1:5000/Hi>`
1471,2019-04-02T09:58:03.184100,Lawrence,I was under the impression the `json` would be appended to the route as the POST data string but I now believe that is not correct
1471,2019-04-02T09:58:14.184600,Lawrence,I'll look  into parsing POST data via Flask restful then
1471,2019-04-02T09:59:03.185600,Carmen,That is not correct for POST calls. Almost every HTTP request framework is going to not append the POST data to the URL. It's going to pass it as actual POST data in the request body.
1471,2019-04-02T09:59:05.185700,Hiroko,its added to the _body_ of the rewquest
1471,2019-04-02T09:59:09.185900,Hiroko,not the route
1471,2019-04-02T09:59:19.186300,Lawrence,I see
1471,2019-04-02T09:59:19.186400,Hiroko,GET adds to the route with query params
1471,2019-04-02T09:59:24.186600,Carmen,^
1471,2019-04-02T09:59:37.186900,Lawrence,"cool - good to know, thanks! <@Hiroko> <@Carmen> :taco:"

1475,2019-04-02T14:35:45.206900,Ashley,"also, GitHub caught a LOT of flack a while back for changes in their policies that caused people to flock from it. For example, they made a change to their CoC that said it's better to accept code that is worse in quality if it's from someone in an underrepresented group than it is to accept better code from someone who isn't in an underrepresented group"
1475,2019-04-02T14:36:05.207100,Claudine,oof
1475,2019-04-02T14:36:08.207200,Lawrence,limited to 2.7 currently and I believe even still the parameterization is preferred according to docs
1475,2019-04-02T14:36:20.207400,Claudine,yea i think you're correct
1475,2019-04-02T14:37:24.207900,Nenita,guess ill learn more as i begin to use it more
1475,2019-04-02T14:38:22.209100,Clemmie,Orthogonal to it. Git is a distributed version control system. It doesn't really have anything to do with your code.
1475,2019-04-02T14:38:33.209500,Nenita,"anyhow, im almost finished uploading it. by the way, because the code uses a few csv files, you (whomever) may not be able to run it off the bat. If need be, i can see if i can make some quick adjustments to get it running without those csv files. really im just looking for criticism on the code rather than the actual gui, etc."
1475,2019-04-02T14:39:09.210300,Clemmie,Learning git will be an excellent addition to your skillset
1475,2019-04-02T14:39:16.210600,Ashley,you can read up on the general disaster that was here <https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/47ksmz/what_is_going_on_with_github/>
1475,2019-04-02T14:39:22.210900,Clemmie,frankly it is expected of devs at this point
1475,2019-04-02T14:39:39.211200,Ashley,"yeah, it's essential"
1475,2019-04-02T14:45:47.212400,Claudine,"definitely, or at least some sort of version control"
1475,2019-04-02T14:45:49.212600,Nenita,"so the project is private, but do i just share the link to those who are able to view it?"
1475,2019-04-02T14:47:00.213200,Lawrence,"I wouldn't if it is private unless you know someone who is a member, then DM"
1475,2019-04-02T14:47:28.213400,Nenita,ah cool. i always miss replies because the notification is so small on my screen
1475,2019-04-02T14:48:28.214200,Nenita,well i have the link. who wants to read up on it?
1475,2019-04-02T14:49:15.214900,Nenita,"i personally dont mind just posting it here, its just that its unfinished and I dont want it open(accessible)  for too long."
1475,2019-04-02T14:50:31.215200,Lawrence,"oh this is your own repo, my apologies"
1475,2019-04-02T14:50:55.215800,Lawrence,then post away if you'd like :slightly_smiling_face: I was under the impression it was a different org
1475,2019-04-02T14:51:42.216200,Nenita,yea no org. im not that 'into it' (lack of better words)
1475,2019-04-02T14:52:01.216400,Nenita,<https://gitlab.com/WuchaDoin/private-invoice-system>
1475,2019-04-02T14:52:28.217100,Nenita,"ive never worked with anyone on code, worked for an org on code, worked with an org on code. im entirely 'freelance', but that comes at a tremendous cost."
1475,2019-04-02T14:53:49.218000,Clemmie,"yeah, you can't just  share the url of a private repo on gitlab - it is truly private."
1475,2019-04-02T14:53:55.218200,Nenita,lol
1475,2019-04-02T14:54:33.218600,Clemmie,You can use internal if you want - that limits it to people who are signed into gitlab
1475,2019-04-02T14:54:47.218800,Clemmie,or just plain public
1475,2019-04-02T14:55:49.219100,Nenita,"i dont know why i feel so stupid right now, but how the heck do i share it lol"
1475,2019-04-02T14:56:09.219400,Nenita,:facepalm:
1475,2019-04-02T14:58:34.221200,Clemmie,"So there isn't so much a concept of sharing, exactly. If it stays private then you need to invite _gitlab_ users to be part of the project, via the gitlab process. If you set it to `internal` then you can just give the url and anyone with a gitlab account can look at it. if you set it to `public` you give the url and anyone can look at it"
1475,2019-04-02T15:00:34.221500,Nenita,i cant even find where to change the private setting
1475,2019-04-02T15:01:03.222200,Nenita,"there are tabs on the left hand side, but i dont see anything or know what to choose to change the sharing setting"
1475,2019-04-02T15:01:41.222400,Nenita,found it
1475,2019-04-02T15:02:35.222900,Nenita,alright settings are set to internal so you should be able to use the link
1475,2019-04-02T15:03:59.223100,Clemmie,"yup, can"
1475,2019-04-02T15:04:15.223300,Nenita,cool
1475,2019-04-02T15:05:33.223400,Clemmie,couple of comments just from glancing at it.
1475,2019-04-02T15:06:04.223600,Clemmie,"snake_case, not CamelCase is preferred for function names in python"
1475,2019-04-02T15:06:35.223800,Nenita,i keep getting them mixed up
1475,2019-04-02T15:07:17.224000,Nenita,the casing and spacing is probably the most I worry about at the moment because I have spent so much time speed learning everything else
1475,2019-04-02T15:12:01.224200,Clemmie,"you can replace the `if..elif` in `ConnectQB.AdjustCX` with `if any(x in str(data['FullName']) for x in ['Charges-2:','Colleen'])`"
1475,2019-04-02T15:13:51.224400,Nenita,never knew of that function
1475,2019-04-02T15:14:27.224600,Nenita,"anyhow, i dont expect anyone to go through all of it, but to just skim through and notice little things that could be adjust as per your reply."
1475,2019-04-02T15:15:14.224800,Clemmie,"ok, ill look at a more generall level"
1475,2019-04-02T15:16:14.225100,Clemmie,You don't need to compare to the `True` and `False` literals - so `if test == False` is just `if not test`
1475,2019-04-02T15:17:16.225300,Nenita,taking notes :notebook:
1475,2019-04-02T15:17:55.225500,Clemmie,There is a lot of repetition in SystemGUI
1475,2019-04-02T15:18:12.225700,Nenita,like what?
1475,2019-04-02T15:18:35.225900,Clemmie,I would do a couple of things - split each page into it's own function and call all the page function - easier  to read
1475,2019-04-02T15:19:02.226100,Clemmie,for all the elements with repeated argument use dictionary unpacking like so
1475,2019-04-02T15:19:16.226300,Clemmie,"you have
```   self.page1_bgn_date.pack(side='left', anchor='center', fill='none', expand=True)
        self.page1_to_label.pack(side='left', anchor='center', fill='none', expand=True)
        self.page1_end_date.pack(side='left', anchor='center', fill='none', expand=True)
```"
1475,2019-04-02T15:20:09.226700,Nenita,"yea, thats my biggest issue"
1475,2019-04-02T15:20:20.226900,Nenita,thats partly why i asked someone to possibly check into it.
1475,2019-04-02T15:20:36.227100,Nenita,i dont know of a simpler method of packing a lot of widgets
1475,2019-04-02T15:21:28.227300,Clemmie,"you can do
```
lcnt = {'side':'left', 'anchor':'center', 'fill':'none', 'expand':True}
self.page1_bgn_date.pack(**lcnt)
self.page1_to_label.pack(**lcnt)
self.page1_end_date.pack(**lcnt)
```"
1475,2019-04-02T15:23:55.227500,Clemmie,"you can even do it where multiple params are the same, but one is different `a(**unpack_dict, param=15)`"
1475,2019-04-02T15:24:24.227700,Nenita,see im not used to (at least to me) special syntax's like the **. i will need to read up on that.
1475,2019-04-02T15:28:38.227900,Clemmie,last one before i have to run - in SystemFunctions you have a pattern of `if x: one_val else: other_val` line lines 81-98
1475,2019-04-02T15:29:35.228100,Nenita,yea those are really ugly. i have no idea how to shorten them
1475,2019-04-02T15:30:30.228300,Nenita,i appreciate you taking the time to skim over it
1475,2019-04-02T15:33:05.228600,Clemmie,"you can make a function like
```
def set_tree(tree, data, var_loc, comparator, data_loc, good_val, bad_val):
    val = bad_val
    if strvar[var_loc].get() == comparator:
       val = good_val
   tree.set(data, data_loc, value=val)
```
and call like
```
set_tree(tree, data, 0, 1, 4, 'True', 'False')
&lt;skip a few...&gt;
set_tree(tree, data, 3, 1, 5, 'None', 'Short')
```"
1475,2019-04-02T15:36:00.228800,Nenita,let me know when you have finished looking at what you want because im going to be switching it back to private
1475,2019-04-02T15:37:20.229000,Nenita,"lastly, in your opinion, with a project this size, is it usually more than a one man project or would it just take a single person a good while (also depends on exp) to create a project of this scope?"
1475,2019-04-02T15:40:50.229200,Clemmie,If that is the extent of it - one person
1475,2019-04-02T15:41:34.229400,Nenita,well thats good to know. it tells me i wont be spending too long on it. or at least more than i need to.
1475,2019-04-02T15:42:02.229600,Clemmie,you can switch it to private - I gotta poke at other stuff
1475,2019-04-02T15:42:40.229800,Nenita,thanks. just be careful where you stick your fingers :smiley:

1477,2019-04-02T17:00:42.231000,Janis,I have like 8 buttons and I am connecting clicked event of each button to the same function. Now when the function gets triggered how do I tell which button got clicked in those 8 buttons
1477,2019-04-02T17:00:46.231200,Nenita,"Not sure, I dont post tkinter issues often, but i do get some help every now and then when needed"
1477,2019-04-02T17:01:40.231800,Janis,Hmm maybe you have an idea about it
1477,2019-04-02T17:02:48.232700,Nenita,"not sure on syntax or functions for pyqt. ive only used tkinter, but with using checkbuttons, tkinter uses stringvar() in order to store a textvaraible."
1477,2019-04-02T17:03:12.233300,Janis,Those are pushButtons not checkboxes
1477,2019-04-02T17:03:19.233500,Nenita,"i use that, not to tell which button was pressed, but because of what stringvar it is i can tell which button was pressed"
1477,2019-04-02T17:03:37.233900,Nenita,"yea i know, i just was pointing out i use stringvar with checkbuttons"
1477,2019-04-02T17:04:03.234600,Janis,Well i am using same text name for every button as they will be performing same operation
1477,2019-04-02T17:04:42.234800,Nenita,would you mind posting some code?
1477,2019-04-02T17:05:18.234900,Janis,None
1477,2019-04-02T17:05:57.235400,Janis,similar to above we have 7 more buttons
1477,2019-04-02T17:08:12.236400,Janis,and reset_one is the function where i want to know which button got pressed so that i can perform some action
1477,2019-04-02T17:11:05.236500,Nenita,"from the look of it, it seems similar to something i'd have to do in certain situations. i.e using the button name/id as the button variable in a function. Again, i apologize im not familiar with pyqt, but hopefully this will give some idea."
1477,2019-04-02T17:12:05.237300,Janis,I don't think that helps but nvm thanks for at least trying
1477,2019-04-02T17:13:38.238100,Nenita,"yea sorry. its even hard for me to find live help on tkinter from time to time, but thankfully tkinter is a little more strightforward imo."

1477,2019-04-02T17:18:27.239500,Janis,Lol thanks that was what I was looking aswell
1477,2019-04-02T17:30:21.240200,Demetrice,So i thought to myself as a project i'd build monopoly. And i sat down today to build it i realized i had no idea how to start
1477,2019-04-02T17:33:03.241200,Demetrice,Logically speaking i should write the board first. But i don't even know how to begin that conceptually. I'm looking into it and thinking i might have to use a grid.
1477,2019-04-02T17:34:04.241600,Nenita,"yep, thats basically me on everything lmao"
1477,2019-04-02T17:37:25.242200,Demetrice,This stuff is hard man. I know what monopoly looks like in my head. I play it all the time but i have no idea how to write it
1477,2019-04-02T17:38:44.243100,Nenita,"id work with the moment first (rolling die, taking turns, moving board pieces) first and then figure out the required math afterword."
1477,2019-04-02T17:39:14.243500,Nenita,because then you'd be working off the framework of taking turns and rotation
1477,2019-04-02T17:54:08.244300,Clemmie,<@Demetrice> if you are on during US work hours tomorrow ping me - I'm happy to work through a design brainstrom with you

1479,2019-04-02T21:12:17.248000,Rodrick,Hello all I was wondering in python if it is possible in a text file to see what line a string is one
1479,2019-04-02T21:12:52.248600,Carmen,"To clarify, you're wanting to find what the line number is that matches a specific string?"
1479,2019-04-02T21:12:57.248800,Rodrick,Correct
1479,2019-04-02T21:13:17.249300,Carmen,"Can the string be repeated in the file? If so, do you need just the first line, or all lines?"
1479,2019-04-02T21:13:43.249700,Rodrick,Uhhhh
1479,2019-04-02T21:13:46.250000,Rodrick,hmmm
1479,2019-04-02T21:13:51.250300,Rodrick,it would be like this
1479,2019-04-02T21:14:11.250800,Rodrick,`Line 1: ryan is cool`
1479,2019-04-02T21:14:22.251200,Rodrick,`Line 2: joe is cool`
1479,2019-04-02T21:14:37.251600,Rodrick,and thats in a whole library
1479,2019-04-02T21:14:49.252000,Rodrick,i want to find the string `ryan is cool`
1479,2019-04-02T21:17:37.255000,Carmen,"The snarky answer to your original question is, ""Yes, Python can do anything that any piece of software can do, including finding a string in a file.""

The slightly more helpful answer for someone just getting started is, ""Use the `readlines` method on the file object you're reading from, then iterate through the list of lines comparing them to your search string. Keep track of the line you're on through an integer you increment each loop. When you find a match, print the line integer and break out of the loop (if you only need to find the first match)."""
1479,2019-04-02T21:18:45.256400,Rodrick,"Ok, but is there a piece of code thats is like `linethestringison = readlineget(""joe is cool"")`"
1479,2019-04-02T21:18:59.256700,Sasha,"For something like this, `for i, line in enumerate(myfile)` would work well. Match against the data in `line`, and `i` will be the corresponding line number."
1479,2019-04-02T21:19:07.256900,Rodrick,ok
1479,2019-04-02T21:20:17.257300,Rodrick,What does `enumerate` do?
1479,2019-04-02T21:21:45.258700,Sasha,"It takes a list/iterator/whatever and gives you both the item number and the item as a tuple. So `enumerate(""foo"")` would give you `(0, ""f""), (1, ""o""), (2, ""o"")`."
1479,2019-04-02T21:22:46.259800,Sasha,Very handy when you want to keep track of a list index as well as access the data conveniently.
1479,2019-04-02T21:23:02.260200,Carmen,"You will need to define a function `readlineget` that takes your search string, does the searching process, and returns the line number. Python doesn't have a built-in function to do that."
1479,2019-04-02T21:24:11.261300,Carmen,"<@Sasha> Purely for my curiosity (and to avoid having to dig into the docs) do you know if enumerating a file object like that reads the entire file into a list, or if it uses a generator to do it lazily?"
1479,2019-04-02T21:25:02.262100,Sasha,"It should be lazy, give or take some amount of buffering in the file I/O."
1479,2019-04-02T21:25:21.262300,Carmen,About what I expected. Groovy.
1479,2019-04-02T21:25:59.263100,Carmen,"`enumerate` isn't in my normal toolkit, so I'm not familiar with its semantics."
1479,2019-04-02T21:29:05.264000,Sasha,"It's rarely required to solve a problem, but it'll often save you a line or two by eliminating manually incremented counter variables, etc."

1480,2019-04-02T22:03:07.268800,Frankie,FWIW request.path is the path it's headed to ... I needed `request.META['HTTP_REFERER']` and more specifically `request._request.META.get('HTTP_REFERER')` since it's a DRF request and not standard django HTTPRequest

1485,2019-04-03T03:11:14.290300,Rayford,So.. How to pass to a django view a request object via test?
1485,2019-04-03T03:12:23.290500,Valeri,What is Join?
1485,2019-04-03T03:12:56.290900,Valeri,Is join the view that you're talking about?
1485,2019-04-03T03:14:05.291100,Rayford,Join is the view
1485,2019-04-03T03:15:07.292500,Rayford,"It look like this:
```

    permission_classes = (AllowAny,)

1485,2019-04-03T03:15:31.293100,Rayford,It's a poorly designed project and now we start to fix it
1485,2019-04-03T03:20:21.296500,Russ,"Well, `json.dumps` returns a `string`, so that won't work.
You'd want to read about testing in Django. But in a few words: inherit your test class from `django.test.TestCase` and then do `<http://self.client.post|self.client.post>({'foo': 'bar'})` it will return you a response object where you can inspect response code, body, etc."
1485,2019-04-03T03:21:51.297400,Valeri,Views should be called using `as_view`
1485,2019-04-03T03:21:55.297700,Rayford,"<@Russ> Yes, I'm doing that in another place but since I want to swap an inner class that the view call I cannot use the client of django"
1485,2019-04-03T03:22:06.297900,Valeri,I meant there are other ways to do this ofcourse
1485,2019-04-03T03:22:25.298400,Valeri,But `as_view` has served me the best tbh
1485,2019-04-03T03:22:50.298800,Valeri,<https://stackoverflow.com/a/14957571/6403406>
1485,2019-04-03T03:22:55.299100,Rayford,But how can I invoke the post class?
1485,2019-04-03T03:23:05.299400,Rayford,post action*
1485,2019-04-03T03:23:05.299500,Valeri,That's what I'm talking about
1485,2019-04-03T03:24:19.300300,Valeri,`View.as_view({'post': 'post'})(request)` should probably work
1485,2019-04-03T03:25:31.300600,Rayford,And request should be the payload I'm testing?
1485,2019-04-03T03:30:43.301200,Valeri,request is an `HttpRequest` object
1485,2019-04-03T03:30:48.301300,Rayford,Like that `foo = Join.as_view({'post': 'post'})({'foo': 'bar'})`?
1485,2019-04-03T03:30:58.301500,Valeri,Nope
1485,2019-04-03T03:31:09.301800,Valeri,The payload goes in as keyword args
1485,2019-04-03T03:32:13.302200,Valeri,Oh wow
1485,2019-04-03T03:32:26.302600,Valeri,Your `post` does not accept `kwargs`
1485,2019-04-03T03:33:11.303700,Valeri,Well you'll have to make an `HttpRequest` object and pass your payload inside the `data` attribute of the object

1485,2019-04-03T03:34:17.305300,Rayford,I'm pretty knew to django and kind of conused. Any change for an example on how to do that in a test? This is what I'm trying to achieve here

1485,2019-04-03T04:19:15.309700,Rayford,Since the logic which interact with external service is in the view it self
1485,2019-04-03T04:19:27.310100,Rayford,They did not wrote a class that holds all the logic for that
1485,2019-04-03T04:20:19.310700,Rayford,"So i'm trinng to do this:

1491,2019-04-03T11:15:56.348600,Luise,I have a question posted on SO for some help which is based on ActiveMQ and OpenCV. You may want to answer that and help me out - <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55498543/how-to-poll-activemq-on-using-stomp-py>
1491,2019-04-03T11:35:57.349200,Azucena,"This should be straightforward but i'm having a hard time trying to create an sftp client using Paramiko (Python).

Code:
```
 transport = sftp.Transport(('myhost', port), 
    default_max_packet_size=10000, default_window_size=10000)
 transport.connect(username='myuser', password='mypassword')
 client_from_transport = sftp.SFTPClient.from_transport(transport)
```
Error:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):

    sftp_client = create_sftp_client()

```
Printing the transport object shows:
```
&lt;paramiko.Transport at 0x68d0c1d0 (cipher aes128-ctr, 128 bits) (connected; awaiting auth)&gt;
```
I got the same error when trying to create an sftp client using sftp_client = SSHClient() instead of going through a transport object. Also tried adding ```timeout=timeout``` when creating my transport object, did not help.

Any thoughts on this please?"

1497,2019-04-03T21:42:40.366500,Carmen,"Are you talking about RAM, CPUs, disk space, and so on? Or are you talking about more intangible project-level requirements for how the server and the software need to behave?"
1497,2019-04-03T21:42:45.366700,Rodrick,None
1497,2019-04-03T21:43:06.367500,Carmen,"Also, is the app built already, or are you doing a rough estimate for provisioning before the app gets built?"
1497,2019-04-03T21:44:50.369100,Russel,"<@Carmen> RAM, CPUs, disk space. I have built out a very small portion of the backend but I guess I would need more of a rough estimate before it is fully built."
1497,2019-04-03T22:08:03.374600,Carmen,"Some questions to help you wrap your head around what you need:
• How much raw processing is needed for what the app is doing? Is it crunching a lot of numbers per request? More processing means you need more processors.
• How many users will you need to support concurrently? More concurrent users = more connections at a time = more processors and more RAM.
• How large are your data structures and responses? If you have to load 500MB of data into memory for each request to do the processing, your RAM requirements are much higher than if you're doing iterative file processing line by line.
• Do you need to be storing data? User uploads, generated files being downloaded by users, etc. More of those means more disk space needed."
1497,2019-04-03T22:09:39.376100,Carmen,One thing that will absolutely help you out is to run some benchmarks on your existing code. Use a testing tool like Apache JMeter to simulate load on your app and see how it performs.
1497,2019-04-03T22:10:19.376800,Carmen,"Your goal is to see how your server behaves, and whether you start bogging down because of lack of RAM, lack of CPUs, or something else."
1497,2019-04-03T22:25:15.378000,Russel,"<@Carmen> Ok great, I'll look into the JMeter now. Thanks for your help!"

1498,2019-04-03T23:31:34.380900,Alishia,I'll greatly appreciate it if someone can provide a code example
1498,2019-04-03T23:36:49.382300,Sasha,"When iterating over an ordered collection, the items are returned in the exact order they were originally added. With an unordered collection, they can be produced in any arbitrary order (such as by hash value, memory address, etc.) as long as they're all included."
1498,2019-04-03T23:39:53.382400,Sasha,None
1498,2019-04-03T23:45:13.384200,Alishia,<@Sasha> so the word 'order' in this context means whether or not the sequence of the data will be kept intact when creating the collection?
1498,2019-04-03T23:45:28.384500,Sasha,Exactly.
1498,2019-04-03T23:45:44.384900,Sasha,"It doesn't imply that the data is alphabetically sorted, for instance."

1) SAML is much more complex and detailed protocol, somewhat difficult to implement and manage.
2) CAS is simpler and has easier implementation as compared to SAML

I like django-mama-cas and django-cs-ng as my choices for server and clients respectively. But as this is my first time getting involved with SSO so I get a little confused trying to wrap my head around these concepts.

1505,2019-04-04T10:14:45.423900,Cedrick,"When I am writing the __init__ method for a class and I would like to use an intermediary value, is it safe to just use a normal variable like below? Will it be cleaned up properly and gone once the method completes?

```
class Thing(object):
    def __init__(self, input):
        intermediary = input + 1
        self.value = intermediary + 1
```
(ignoring the over simplicity and pointlessness of the example)"
1505,2019-04-04T10:15:54.424900,Cedrick,I want to ensure that intermediary value is gone and not some class/static member
1505,2019-04-04T10:16:21.425600,Clemmie,"You sure can, but it doesn’t look like the best way to go"
1505,2019-04-04T10:16:34.426000,Clemmie,can you talk a little about why you want/need to do it?
1505,2019-04-04T10:18:22.427900,Cedrick,"well in my class I am consuming some xml and I'm using xpath to get a list of sub nodes (the intermediary) and then that list I pass to another function in a list comprehension. So the intermediary is there for readability, I could just be putting the xpath in the comprehension but that looks messy."

1505,2019-04-04T10:19:58.429000,Cedrick,this is unfortunately complicated by the api's xml schema that I am consuming

1505,2019-04-04T10:20:25.429600,Cedrick,"cool, thanks!"
1505,2019-04-04T10:24:40.432100,Cedrick,I guess I am also curious about how people would feel about my use of __dict__ there ... these objects need to be json serializable so I am using that for now... although there is the possibility of needing to write a .to_dict() method later down the road in case I don't want to serialize everything in it like a method.

1507,2019-04-04T11:20:32.434100,Dawn,is there a way to parse jsonL with the regular json pacakge in python?
1507,2019-04-04T11:20:51.434600,Dawn,it's basically every json object on a new line i think
1507,2019-04-04T11:22:49.435200,Clemmie,"I don’t think so, or at least not without munging first. A quick search found this package <https://github.com/wbolster/jsonlines>"
1507,2019-04-04T11:23:47.435800,Dawn,hm yeah wanted to prevent installing additional packages but i guess it's the only way to go

1509,2019-04-04T13:03:49.439500,Christal,"in pandas is there a way to append data to an existing csv file but save it as new file? I have df1, df2 and want to save it as df3"
1509,2019-04-04T13:04:22.439600,Nenita,"Alright, I've tried this two ways and it's beginning to frustrate me. The problem is in this line: for i, val in enumerate(lists[1].get(0, tk.END)), my list has 1 item. When the enumeration begins at 0 and hits its max len which is 1 item (rather 0), it just kills the function rather than continue. I cannot find a way to say ""if you've reached the end of the list and the item wasn't found, then add the item"""
1509,2019-04-04T13:08:28.440500,Nenita,"<@Christal> just create a new line for df3.to_csv(""new file name"")"
1509,2019-04-04T13:08:55.441000,Nenita,if you havent already done df = df.append(df2) or whatever your looking to do
1509,2019-04-04T13:10:19.441600,Nenita,although i hate append because it always appends vertically rather than horizontally. i usually use:
1509,2019-04-04T13:13:07.443200,Clemmie,<@Nenita> if I understand it correctly you want to use the `for...else` construct. Whatever is in the `else` clause will fire if the loop completes without `break`ing
1509,2019-04-04T13:13:45.443600,Nenita,correct. i just need to do something when it finishes the iterration
1509,2019-04-04T13:13:54.443900,Nenita,other than just ending
1509,2019-04-04T13:14:19.444800,Clemmie,"on the last element, regardless of whether it encountered a `break` or not?"
1509,2019-04-04T13:15:27.445300,Nenita,ill need the break at the last as long as its after if check == val
1509,2019-04-04T13:16:07.445400,Nenita,this works but even after break it still fires which i dont need it to
1509,2019-04-04T13:16:26.445900,Clemmie,right - use that but add an `else`
1509,2019-04-04T13:16:42.446000,Clemmie,None
1509,2019-04-04T13:16:54.446700,Nenita,wait! you can use for with else?
1509,2019-04-04T13:17:03.446900,Clemmie,that will run the final line if and only if the for loop completed without ever encountering a `break`
1509,2019-04-04T13:18:09.448200,Nenita,holy i never knew you could use else with for. that helps so much
1509,2019-04-04T13:18:11.448400,Clemmie,"it is esoteric, and you are probably better off figuring out a more understandable way of doing it (it will confuse many pythonistas, even fairly senior) but it is the stated behavior of the construct"
1509,2019-04-04T13:18:52.449100,Nenita,"with as much work as i am having to do along with learning at the same time, i usually create working code then go back to clean it up and then optimize it."
1510,2019-04-04T13:37:57.449400,Alline,"Hi everyone! Is there a way to test if my solution is using imported methods which have been deprecated? Just so that I can just pip install the target versions of my dependencies and fix everything that needs updating. I've only noted deprecation warning when such methods are actually called, and I fear that some of them might not be used that often (and usually when I write unit tests for my solution I mock third party library .. maybe THIS is the problem, in which case I'd rush immediately to the testing_ channel)"
1510,2019-04-04T13:47:45.451800,Nenita,"<@Alline> from what i've been reading online, deprecation warnings have to be declared therefore, if the methods don't contain a deprecation warning, i would check out this. it looks like you may be able to set it up for testing, but not sure if it's what you're looking for. other than that, i thankfully haven't received much deprecation warnings so i don't focus on it much, more over, have much knowledge on handing deprecation. <https://pypi.org/project/deprecation/>"

1511,2019-04-04T15:16:04.456700,Deirdre,I just need to hit the mock endpoint to avoid charging the real API for testing purposes
1511,2019-04-04T15:20:16.457000,Carmen,"In the past I've done this by setting up a small Flask app that accepts the appropriate requests and returns the desired response. If you have copies of what you're supposed to get back from the API, you can save those as text files and have the Flask app just return those as responses."
1511,2019-04-04T16:05:24.457400,Carmen,"Pretty much. Just have that method read from your saved response file, and return the contents."
1511,2019-04-04T18:50:17.459100,Carmen,"That's pretty much exactly how I'd do it, swapping SQLAlchemy for a different DB driver."

1513,2019-04-04T16:43:12.458000,Raguel,"I think one way would be that when you create your lambda function, in environment variables provide credentials, and then call them in your scripts like this
```usr = os.environ['usr']
pwd= os.environ['pwd']
path = os.environ['path']```
and then use sqlalchemy or any library to create connection."

I am using the IEX cloud API to gather some stock data and using the `pyEX` package from here but I'd like to monkey patch it to change the _URL_PREFIX in the _getJsonIEXCloud() function of common.py"
1514,2019-04-04T20:32:53.461100,Frankie,Here's the package: <https://github.com/timkpaine/pyEX>
1514,2019-04-04T20:37:20.461700,Frankie,basically I would like to monkey patch common.py like so
1514,2019-04-04T20:41:08.463700,Frankie,"actually now that I'm looking atit this would require patching every function across the whole package since they all call `_getJson(url, token, version)` (see `stocks.py` for example"
1514,2019-04-04T20:42:47.464500,Frankie,"is there a better way? main reason I want to do this is that this will only call the real API in its current state, which wastes messages that cost money during development."
1514,2019-04-04T20:46:39.465600,Sasha,"Is it possible to only apply the patch when you start up with a ""debug mode"" setting, rather than trying to pass in a runtime sandbox flag for each call?"
1514,2019-04-04T20:55:29.466100,Frankie,"sure, but I think the problem is still that the client doesn't actually control the call of the getJson() function"
1514,2019-04-04T20:56:15.466600,Frankie,I suppose I could just patch the _URL_PREFIX_2 variable in debug mode I guess?
1514,2019-04-04T20:57:34.467000,Sasha,Good thought.
1514,2019-04-04T20:58:10.467600,Frankie,"```
_URL_PREFIX2 = '<https://cloud.iexapis.com/{version}/>'

if os.environ.get('DJANGO_ENV') == 'DEV':
    _URL_PREFIX2 = '<https://sandbox.iexapis.com/{version}/>'
```
Anything wrong w/ that? This happens to be in a django project so I will have that set"
1514,2019-04-04T20:59:51.468900,Frankie,"Also is it possible to change that from outside the actual package file? like in my own code can I do something like
```
import pyEX
pyEX.common._URL_PREFIX2 = 'blah blah blah'
```?"
1514,2019-04-04T21:00:17.469300,Sasha,"Yep, that's both possible and recommended."
1514,2019-04-04T21:00:32.469700,Frankie,I didn't know you could actually override a variable from outside the module. huh...TIL
1514,2019-04-04T21:00:43.469900,Frankie,that makes this 1000 times simpler
1514,2019-04-04T21:02:47.470700,Sasha,"I'm not 100% sure whether you need to import the common module directly to do that, but if you run into trouble, that's something to try."
1514,2019-04-04T21:03:37.470900,Frankie,well we're about to find out :slightly_smiling_face:
1514,2019-04-04T21:08:16.471100,Frankie,sweeeet it worked!
1514,2019-04-04T21:08:20.471300,Frankie,that was simple

1514,2019-04-04T21:27:10.478000,Sasha,"No, but it does allow optional parameters."
1515,2019-04-04T21:26:32.477700,Alishia,"Hello, I came across this function called range(), and I realised in the documentation, that there are 2 ways to call the function.
1. range(stop)

What I don't understand is that in the documentation, it seems like there is 2 function declaration. (or is it a class?)
```
class range(stop)

Does python allow repeated function declaration?"
1515,2019-04-04T21:27:52.479100,Alishia,"Hi Ed, in the function declaration, all 3 params for range(start, stop[, step]) are optional"
1515,2019-04-04T21:28:48.480800,Alishia,"since the order is start, stop, step"
1515,2019-04-04T21:29:21.481400,Sasha,"Probably internally it's defined like `def range(first=None, second=None, third=None)` or something arbitrary like that, and the code takes care of figuring out what to do."
1515,2019-04-04T21:30:49.482500,Alishia,"so it probably checks if second arg is present. and if its present, they set it as the 'stop'?"

1516,2019-04-04T22:41:43.487000,Conchita,Are you a wizard <@Sasha>? You always seem to have good answers!
1517,2019-04-04T22:34:11.486000,Sasha,"You need a `global df2` inside the function if you intend to modify global variables, as opposed to just read them."
1517,2019-04-04T22:34:45.486400,Sasha,In the first example all the code was executing in the global context instead of inside a function scope.
1517,2019-04-04T22:42:39.487600,Sasha,"I've just made thousands of errors over the years, including that one.  :sweat:"
1517,2019-04-04T22:52:07.488100,Marth,I just learned too!  :taco: <@Sasha>
1517,2019-04-04T22:55:22.490000,Sasha,"BTW, this can be subtle. You only need the `global` if you are *reassigning* the variable. If you are, say, appending an item to a global list, it's still the same list object, so it's not necessary, even though the contents are being modified."
1517,2019-04-04T23:39:10.492300,Sasha,"Often that's handled by your source control system, in that you can work on a branch of the code until your change is finalized and ready to be incorporated for release."
1518,2019-04-04T23:34:09.491000,Chuck,Is there a function naming convention used by the Python community when you need to make a copy of a function so you can work on significant code changes without breaking existing code?
1518,2019-04-04T23:34:57.491400,Chuck,"Or, perhaps, a convention for doing that that has nothing to with naming?"
1518,2019-04-04T23:44:02.494800,Carmen,"Normally if I have to do something like that and it doesn't make sense to put it in a branch for development, I have 3 functions: the public function everything else uses, and then two internal functions that the public function calls based on its own logic. One internal function is the old function, and the other is the new function."
1518,2019-04-04T23:44:17.495300,Chuck,"Hmmm, how often would you branch for a single function rewrite? I guess that depends on the coder"
1518,2019-04-04T23:44:28.495900,Chuck,<@Carmen> I like that approach
1518,2019-04-04T23:44:33.496100,Carmen,Normally you'd use a configuration switch to dictate which internal function gets executed.
1518,2019-04-04T23:44:56.496700,Carmen,That also lets you A/B test for specific users.
1518,2019-04-04T23:45:22.497600,Carmen,"That said, if you're making significant changes, often you really should be doing it on a separate branch so that you can make the switch wholesale."
1518,2019-04-04T23:45:49.498200,Chuck,"I do need to wrap my brain around creating branches in Git, and absorbing the changes back into my main code base -- even though I'm the only dev and the only user of the code, it would be useful to understand"
1518,2019-04-04T23:46:35.498900,Carmen,"`git checkout &lt;branch name&gt;`
`git commit`
`git checkout master`
`git merge &lt;branch name&gt;`"
1518,2019-04-04T23:47:13.499400,Carmen,Branches are even easier to create in Git than they are in other source control systems.
1518,2019-04-04T23:48:47.500300,Chuck,"So... let's say I have a (windows 7) directory called ""MyProject"" in which my current code resides... How do I work on a branch while also being able to execute the non-branch version of the code?"
1518,2019-04-04T23:52:20.501000,Sasha,"If you want them both to be simultaneously accessible, you'd want to checkout a second copy of your git repo in a different directory."
1518,2019-04-04T23:53:33.502200,Chuck,"Okay, so I could have ""MyProject"" and ""MyProject_Branch"". I leave ""MyProject"" untouched, I work on the code in ""MyProject_Branch"", and when I'm ready, I merge the changes in ""MyProject_Branch"" back into ""MyProject""..."
1518,2019-04-04T23:54:30.503200,Sasha,"Well, this is only if you need to run them both side-by-side. Any git repo can be on any branch, and can change branches easily."
1518,2019-04-04T23:57:00.504100,Sasha,So people typically will just switch back and forth in their main git directory as needed.
1518,2019-04-04T23:58:33.504500,Chuck,how do I change between the master and the branch in the same directory?
1518,2019-04-04T23:59:16.504900,Chuck,(unless I misunderstood what you meant by this: `So people typically will just switch back and forth in their main git directory as needed.`)
1518,2019-04-05T00:01:32.505700,Sasha,The `git checkout [branch]` command that <@Carmen> referenced changes it.
1518,2019-04-05T00:02:58.505900,Chuck,"okay, here goes"
1518,2019-04-05T00:03:58.506500,Sasha,"Hang on. Don't ever say ""okay, here goes"" with git. Look up the docs and understand the command, please..."
1518,2019-04-05T00:04:11.506900,Chuck,"lol, good advice :slightly_smiling_face:"

1518,2019-04-05T00:08:21.509200,Chuck,"<@Sasha> and <@Carmen> -- thanks both, this was a very useful conversation to me :taco:"
1518,2019-04-05T00:12:38.509700,Chuck,Do either of you use PyCharm?
1518,2019-04-05T00:13:06.510300,Chuck,Just wondering if there is any way in PyCharm to see at a glance which 'branch' you currently have activated
1518,2019-04-05T00:13:59.510600,Chuck,ah... bottom right
1518,2019-04-05T01:36:32.511700,Chuck,"okay, so that went okay... i created a branch, and merged it back into the master -- although I wish it had been a little more guided than throwing conflict text into the source code."
1518,2019-04-05T01:37:07.512500,Chuck,"I think the only real 'downside' I could see was that the branch changes have to be committed before you can go back to the master, and vice versa -- although this does make sense"
1518,2019-04-05T01:37:34.512900,Sasha,There's `git stash` if you want to save uncommitted changes temporarily.
1518,2019-04-05T01:37:48.513400,Chuck,it looks like PyCharm can do that as well
1518,2019-04-05T01:38:38.514300,Chuck,is it normal on a merge that you get all the conflicted code in  the source code and then you manually go remove / resolve the conflicts by editing the source?
1518,2019-04-05T01:38:49.514600,Chuck,or did I do that part non-optimally?
1518,2019-04-05T01:40:28.515900,Sasha,"There are graphical tools which can make that friendlier, and if you know you want to keep one version or the other, you can force a ""mine or theirs"" merge, but yeah, generally the philosophy is that in case of conflict, you want to have human eyes on it."
1518,2019-04-05T01:40:53.516300,Chuck,that must be a huge task if you're merging in a lot of changes across a complex project
1518,2019-04-05T01:42:00.517600,Chuck,or if you're trying to resolve conflicts from a branch when the master has moved along significantly via other branch merges...
1518,2019-04-05T01:44:42.519900,Sasha,"Depends. Many changes in large codebases tend to merge without manual intervention, since people aren't editing the same lines simultaneously."
1518,2019-04-05T02:07:43.520800,Chuck,"Yep, that might have been my mistake... I think I commented out the change I had started on in the 'master' after I created the branch, so there were probably changes outstanding in both"
1518,2019-04-05T02:08:25.521300,Chuck,<@Sasha> Have another one of :taco:
1518,2019-04-05T02:12:49.522400,Chuck,"You're absolutely right -- I just tested creating a branch, and merging it back with a known committed master, and no conflicts, just brought the change in from the branch"
1518,2019-04-05T02:13:42.523000,Chuck,"Last question, is it standard to remove branches that have been merged back into the master? or do you leave them there as a history?"
1518,2019-04-05T02:20:15.525300,Sasha,"That's a good question, and I'm not quite sure, but I think common best practice would be to remove the branch if you don't plan any further work on it. A branch is basically just a label for a particular commit that shows up in a list of branches, so all the history is preserved either way, and you can recreate it later pointing to the same or a different commit if you want."
1518,2019-04-05T02:21:34.526100,Sasha,"The exception would be that some people use release branches, so it's useful to keep the ""v1.2"" release tagged in the repo indefinitely."
1518,2019-04-05T02:23:10.526900,Chuck,Fair enough... some conversation on SO seeming to indicate a general consensus to remove merged branches

1519,2019-04-05T03:29:11.531400,Chelsey,"Any VS Code gurus out there? I'm really liking the IDE, but sometimes it fails a bit on recognising imports, which flags warnings, and then doesn't format code properly (since it doesn't recognise eg. a model). The code is fine, as it runs OK, it's just display in the IDE itself.

I'm using flake8 for linting, intellisense is turned on, jedi is disabled. Any suggestions? I find it really irritating :slightly_smiling_face:

Here's an example:"
1520,2019-04-05T03:32:27.532000,Jimmy,does the python extension point to the correct virtualenv ?
1520,2019-04-05T05:00:06.533100,Chelsey,<@Jimmy>. Yep :slightly_smiling_face: Should have mentioned that as well.
1520,2019-04-05T05:00:29.533600,Chelsey,"(If it didn't the rest_framework imports would also be underlined, as it's the only env with that installed...)"
1520,2019-04-05T05:01:00.534000,Jimmy,then idk but I think I had the same happens in some projects
1520,2019-04-05T05:17:14.535500,Chelsey,"That's what I seem to be landing on - that it ""just happens"" sometimes. Bloody annoying though, and I'm a little compulsive when it comes to warnings and errors, so it really grates :slightly_smiling_face: Hopefully some release in the near future will sort out the intellisense for python ..."
1520,2019-04-05T06:04:20.541100,Chelsey,"If anybody is interested. I think the problem is that intellisense doesn't recognise my python project directory.

I have this kind of setup:

```
root project dir
|
-&gt; .vscode
-&gt; djangoproj
    |-&gt; Project
    |-&gt; App1
    |-&gt; App2
-&gt; docker-compose.yml
-&gt; Dockerfile
-&gt; requirements.txt
-&gt; etc.
```
Within the project, the code runs fine with `from app1.model import ModelX`, but intellisense thinks it's starting in the root project dir, not in the Django project dir. If I change the line to `from djangoproj.app1.model import ModelX` the intellisense is happy, but of course that doesn't run.

I can't find any workspace setting to amend the root directory that intellisense uses to look for modules within the project itself."

If they have specific requirements for protocols, that makes the determination for you as well. If not, if everyone is going to be  integrating after the fact with your internal solution, I'd pick the easiest and cheapest one to setup. You can always transition later to a different piece of software as your identity provider (though that can admittedly be a difficult task)."
1523,2019-04-05T09:08:50.559100,Carmen,"<@Sasha> <@Chuck> I know I'm chiming in rather late on this, but a few thoughts from my experience:

• Removing branches is not so common in other SCMs like SVN, but I see it fairly commonly in Git repos. Branch early, branch often, and throw them away when you don't need them anymore.
• `git tag` should be your go-to for release versioning."

1531,2019-04-05T16:25:42.594000,Hiroko,I don’t know if that’ll work for anything other than just telling the files are different
1531,2019-04-05T16:26:10.594600,Hiroko,"if you want to know what has changed, there’s a few options but are highly depedent on the format of the data"

1531,2019-04-05T16:33:34.600000,Aura,Is there any other approach I can take without reading the file that you can think of?
1531,2019-04-05T16:35:15.601500,Sasha,"It depends what your goal is. If you just want to detect changes, you could look at just the size and modification timestamp, for instance. Or you could do a stochastic sample of a subset of the file bytes and hash those. But in the general case, if you don't read every byte of the file, you'll miss any changes that involve the bytes you didn't read."
1531,2019-04-05T16:39:33.603400,Aura,sampling seems like a good way to do  it. Ill give making the accuracy a parameter for acceptance rate. Thanks again. Just joined the community and hoping to contribute

didnt realize you're not supposed to use the `fieldnames` argument in *csv.DictReader* if your file already has the header row in it"

1533,2019-04-05T19:26:11.616700,Sasha,"<@Melia> Generally looks pretty good. A few small points: (1) You have some extra spaces in your `angles` keys and values that may cause problems. (2) In your `while` loop, `and` doesn't quite work like that. You would want `while angle1 in angles and angle2 in angles` instead. (3) You might want to switch to a `while True` loop and `break` out of it on invalid input, which would avoid the duplication of the `input` statements. (4) It's sometime confusing to reuse the same variable for different purposes. Here you have `angle1` being an angle string for some parts of the code, and a hex character for other parts. You could do `hex1 = angles[angle1]` or something like that to be clearer."

So what exactly is happening
User is filling some form (or say writing some blogs on medium) , now the tab he/she is writing is logged in and now another tab opens logged out the user and closes
So currently the tab in which the user is writing blogs shows that user is logged in but actually his/her session get expired
So now when user save the blogs then blog will not get saved and response from server shows that the user has been logged out and now when we redirect user for login again then at that time all the data will get lost(the written blog)
So my main question is to how to save the blog"

I was using vagrant and was trying to do port forwarding when the 400 response first came up. "
1536,2019-04-06T23:27:22.641900,Sasha,"That's not a lot of info to go on, but my first instincts would be to (a) try to undo whatever change you did that started causing the errors, (b) look at the logs of whatever server you're using to handle those requests."

1536,2019-04-06T23:32:45.642100,Erline,I see that Apache has error logs and access logs. The access logs don’t say all that much. Are there other places to look for logs that should be considered?
1536,2019-04-06T23:33:36.642900,Sasha,"It depends what you're running. Are you just using Apache with static pages, or is it a frontend for a Django / Flask / PHP / something dynamic site?"
1536,2019-04-06T23:37:14.643000,Erline,I hope I can answer your question. I think my local machine was already running it. 
1536,2019-04-06T23:37:48.643100,Erline,I say that because before the 400 I had seen the “it works” generic message you’d normally see from Apache.

1537,2019-04-07T00:29:23.657400,Erline,"Venv mode is to ensure you know that you are in a virtual environment, and if you ultimately name your virtual environments different names, you know which one you’re in. "
1537,2019-04-07T00:31:15.657600,Erline,You wouldn’t want everything installed directly on to your machine because different projects may need different versions of things.

1538,2019-04-07T01:01:53.662900,Valeri,You basically activate one to tell python to use a specific set of libraries
1538,2019-04-07T01:02:52.663200,Valeri,Does that clear up things? <@Eliseo>
1538,2019-04-07T01:37:08.664500,Eliseo,<@Valeri> Yes thank you
1538,2019-04-07T02:04:59.664600,Erline,"<@Eliseo> yes, your clone is something entirely different. Clones are just some files and folders. Nothing special. It just so happened that you got those files and folders from some outside place instead of creating them on your computer in that moment. "
1539,2019-04-07T02:07:03.664700,Erline,The term just is shorthand for “make me an identical set of these files and folders from this outside place onto my actual computer” in your specific case. 
1539,2019-04-07T09:29:58.674000,Carmen,<@Erline> I've got a bit of experience getting local Django environments working inside Vagrant. Are you still experiencing your problem?
1540,2019-04-07T06:24:14.670100,Leida,"hi, im mucking around in django and need to have my `FormModel` not to replace the existing value in the db but rather add to the value. It seems to me that if you want to do extra stuff on form save you put it into the view and dont commit until you are done editing. But i dont want to write the value to the db rather than add to it so i should override the `save` function of the `FormModel` in my custom model and use an `F` function to do it?"
1540,2019-04-07T06:25:12.670600,Leida,and should i ask this in the django channel instead?

1542,2019-04-07T10:51:39.677000,Valeri,<@Donnell> If you're on wifi you're already on the same network
1542,2019-04-07T10:52:05.677700,Valeri,You just need to expose your database port number to your local network
1542,2019-04-07T10:52:29.678400,Valeri,And access it from elsewhere using the server IP and port number
1542,2019-04-07T11:03:19.680300,Donnell,<@Valeri> Our systems are wired. We are connected using Ethernet from a switch. Router is connected to Switch.
1542,2019-04-07T11:03:41.680800,Donnell,"From this switch, the ethernet cables are connected to computers."
1542,2019-04-07T11:04:30.681000,Valeri,Cool
1542,2019-04-07T11:04:46.681600,Valeri,Just expose the database on your local network
1542,2019-04-07T11:05:55.682000,Donnell,umm Can you give an example?
1542,2019-04-07T11:33:37.684400,Donnell,thanks <@Leida> :thumbsup:
1542,2019-04-07T11:37:16.687000,Donnell,"I have a doubt. If everything works with LAN thing, do I just need to install MySql DB in a system that will be used by other systems to connect and retrieve data? Or I need to install a Server?

In a conversation with my manager, he said should make a system as our local server for development purpose where you all will access MySql database and work with it."
1543,2019-04-07T11:23:47.683800,Leida,"often, opening an app to the network is the difference of configuring the IP:PORT from 127.0.0.1:PORT to 0.0.0.0:PORT. Dont know about MySQL instance tho. Heres a discussion that might help <https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=960675>"
1543,2019-04-07T11:35:30.685000,Leida,you are welcome
1543,2019-04-07T11:39:12.687600,Leida,to have access from LAN you need something that would serve up the database - the server
1543,2019-04-07T11:39:17.687800,Leida,what OS are you on?
1543,2019-04-07T11:39:32.688200,Donnell,We run Windows 10 on all the systems.
1543,2019-04-07T11:42:13.689100,Leida,<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-installation.html> this seems quite comprehensive but it also means there is alot to read xD
1543,2019-04-07T11:44:14.690200,Leida,you will probably want to install the server as a service so that you dont have to manually start it every time the computer restarts: <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/windows-start-service.html>
1543,2019-04-07T11:44:20.690400,Donnell,Yeah. We downloaded *MySQL Community Server* from <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/>
1543,2019-04-07T11:44:51.690800,Donnell,and Installed in our computers and status is active.
1543,2019-04-07T11:45:11.691200,Donnell,Did we do it right?
1543,2019-04-07T11:46:35.691700,Leida,<https://medium.com/@kasunsiyambalapitiya/how-to-setup-a-mysql-server-on-local-area-network-lan-c3c5012c7d6b> here it explain how to open it up to lan on both linux and windows
1543,2019-04-07T11:47:15.692400,Leida,something about creating a cnf file setting the IP
1543,2019-04-07T11:47:20.692600,Donnell,Oh great! thanks for the article <@Leida>
1543,2019-04-07T11:49:08.694500,Donnell,"And we have now the LAN as barrier. Trying to figure out how to setup. This is new to me. I've found some YouTube videos on software configuration on systems that are to be connected to each other. But before that, I want to get confirmation if we are good with Hardware setup and go to software configuration."
1543,2019-04-07T11:50:25.695300,Donnell,"Our ISP's Internet cable is connected to Router.
Router --&gt; Switch

1543,2019-04-07T11:51:43.695600,Donnell,Are we good to go?
1543,2019-04-07T12:05:25.696300,Virgil,"<@Carmen>
1) Yes, there 4 existing systems but they work independent of each other, communicating with the same DBs. But moving them from regular auth structure to SSO is upto me as well, so no specific requirement.
2) Do you have some experience with CAS or SAML?"
1543,2019-04-07T12:26:54.702500,Virgil,"There 2 or 3 options available for Django, I like django-mama-cas with django-cas-ng for clients."
1543,2019-04-07T12:27:10.702700,Virgil,Thanks for your time :slightly_smiling_face: I really appreciate it
1544,2019-04-07T12:07:17.698100,Sasha,"Yep, that's pretty standard. For local network comms, the machines should be able to access each other through the switch. However, your router is probably giving everyone dynamic network addresses, which may or may not be constant over time. You might need to configure the router to give a predictable address to the machine acting as the MySQL server so that the other machines know how to find it. For the mean time, you can get things tested using whatever address is happens to have, though."
1544,2019-04-07T12:09:45.698200,Carmen,I do not have direct experience with it. I've just done a decent bit of research on it in the past.
1544,2019-04-07T12:10:45.698400,Carmen,"So if I were you I'd set up one of the existing SSO identity providers, whichever one is easiest and least expensive for you to setup, and then integrate the other systems with it."
1544,2019-04-07T12:11:35.698600,Carmen,Which protocol you decide on for those other integrations once again boils down to which library is most convenient for you to work with.
1544,2019-04-07T12:13:56.700600,Carmen,"It seems like there might be a bit of terminology confusion here. ""Server"" has two separate meanings in this context. You have the database server software, MySQL Server. That's what is listening on your network and what your clients connect to. You also have the database server hardware, which is whatever machine is connected to the network and running MySQL Server."
1544,2019-04-07T12:14:42.701600,Carmen,"Any computer can be a server, but typically for something like that you want a dedicated server, which is just a machine that's always on and isn't running other things (e.g. being used as a desktop for the secretary or another developer)."
1544,2019-04-07T12:18:44.701900,Donnell,"<@Carmen> Yes little bit confusion with terminology. So for our project, we need to have centralized database. But in conversation with our project manager, he was saying we need to have a computer working as Server and should have database. So maybe he is saying a dedicated server for this?"
1544,2019-04-07T12:19:19.702100,Donnell,So XAMP would help me make the computer as dedicated server ?
1544,2019-04-07T12:24:21.702300,Carmen,"Whether something is a server or not is entirely dependent on what you do with it and whether it's dedicated to that task. If you install MySQL on it, and it's dedicated to providing those database services to other apps, it's now your dedicated database server."
1544,2019-04-07T12:37:04.702900,Donnell,Oh ok. So I will confirm with him and I'll be back if I have any doubts regarding it. Thanks a lot <@Carmen>
1545,2019-04-07T12:16:42.701700,Donnell,Sure <@Sasha> thanks for confirmation.

1547,2019-04-07T14:50:02.706900,Hiroko,There's documentation on jetbrains website to use a specific interpreter 
1547,2019-04-07T14:50:07.707100,Hiroko,Look at that 
1547,2019-04-07T14:50:56.707700,Marceline,Do you guys use global environments or a file with keys for an app on a server
1547,2019-04-07T14:53:22.708300,Hiroko,Env vars or a key vault
1547,2019-04-07T14:54:20.708600,Marceline,Howcome
1547,2019-04-07T14:58:49.709100,Hiroko,Env vars are easy to use
1547,2019-04-07T14:59:17.710000,Hiroko,"And when you build an image for deployment, you can integrate a key vault to populate the env vars "
1547,2019-04-07T14:59:32.710400,Hiroko,So everything is as secure as it can be 
1547,2019-04-07T15:00:11.711500,Hiroko,"Of course, if you get hacked with root privilege escalation,there's not much you can do"
1547,2019-04-07T15:00:26.712000,Hiroko,Or if your credentials are compromised 
1547,2019-04-07T15:02:11.712700,Marceline,"Okay thanks. I will take a look at it. As of now, Env vars and keys in a file are the same security wise right?"
1547,2019-04-07T15:04:00.713200,Hiroko,Where's the key file going to come from?
1547,2019-04-07T15:04:17.714000,Hiroko,You can't include it in source control 
1547,2019-04-07T15:04:53.714800,Marceline,"A flask app, but I am going to use .gitignore"
1547,2019-04-07T15:06:11.715400,Marceline,I was thinking of just importing the keys where I need and not including them in source control.
1547,2019-04-07T15:06:31.715800,Marceline,"Like you said, if someone hacks in, they would have access to everything anyways"
1547,2019-04-07T15:07:11.716400,Marceline,Another reason I am asking is because I can't store certain characters as a global environment
1547,2019-04-07T15:07:25.716600,Marceline,like certain api keys

I get a 200 or 201 response depending on my code. My issue is everything I have attempted with the ""method"" returns a 201 with a message saying ""Method signature missing"". Of course the documentation is limited. I can only provide so much because I have to maintain confidentiality.  Any help would be most appreciated! :blush:"

1553,2019-04-07T19:22:59.774500,Sparkle,What are u trying to clean? Are you trying to just trim the values that have trailing spaces

1555,2019-04-08T04:47:59.786700,Jimmy,looks like logging as changed and your configuration is not appropriate
1555,2019-04-08T04:48:15.787000,Jimmy,`logging_config_func(LOGGING)` &lt;- what's in `LOGGING` ?
1555,2019-04-08T04:59:34.787900,Alejandrina,This message was deleted.
1555,2019-04-08T05:09:04.790800,Conchita,"Ok so I have a few hundred csv files I need to work with, that have a bit messed up structure. The header looks like this
```Address	Amount	Last deposit block	Last deposit timestamp	Last withdrawal block	Last withdrawal timestamp```
And the data is separated by commas like this:
```""NQd9pW2TZq9Eiemtb,5110061149.38249,407355,2018-04-30 03:17:25,407357,2018-04-30 03:24:43""
```"
1555,2019-04-08T05:09:50.791500,Conchita,I'm a bit confused on how to solve this as a column can be `Last deposit block` so I can't really use spaces as a delimiter
1555,2019-04-08T05:11:11.792200,Jimmy,something in your logging configuration is not supported in 3.7 I guess
1555,2019-04-08T05:11:27.792600,Jimmy,looks like tab is the header delimiter
1555,2019-04-08T05:14:38.793900,Conchita,"Yeah that could be. When I run the following, I get the whole row of data though;

```with open(csv_path, 'r') as csv_file:

    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter='\t') 
    next(csv_reader, None)

    for row in csv_reader:

        for char in "","":
            address = row[0]

            print(address)```"
1555,2019-04-08T05:15:11.794900,Conchita,Where I would expect to get only `NQd9pW2TZq9Eiemtb` contrary to the whole row
1555,2019-04-08T05:15:32.795700,Jimmy,I'm not super familiar with `csv.reader ` but there might be a way to have a separate delimiter for the headers vs the rows
1555,2019-04-08T05:15:39.796100,Jimmy,I doubt it but maybe
1555,2019-04-08T05:15:41.796300,Linda,"Yeah, the data is comma seperated, only first row has tab delimited columns from what i can see"
1555,2019-04-08T05:16:30.796700,Jimmy,or parse the header and data separately
1555,2019-04-08T05:18:30.797100,Conchita,Can I skip the header and just parse the data?
1555,2019-04-08T05:18:44.797500,Conchita,I don't need the column names for any purpose
1555,2019-04-08T05:18:55.797900,Jimmy,pretty sure you can. look at the doc :slightly_smiling_face:

1561,2019-04-08T10:46:23.845700,Johna,"hey all! i was trying this experiment over the weekend… my brother has a dungeons and dragons character generator spreadsheet in google sheets. he added some functions to generate them with a click of a button based on the predetermined stats he has for each monster in another sheet. he said it works okay but has some issues around managing states, it’s sluggish, and it’s missing a few features he’d like. i was trying to write a no-database application so i wrote a character dataclass and tried to instantiate a bunch of instances of that class in memory with the instances named based on their names (row data) in the csv. that is to say he had a csv that is like:
```
Creature_Name, Max_HP
Bat, 1
Hero, 20
```
and I wrote a dataclass for character then was trying to “grab” each character to generate the objects, where i’d want the output to be the same result as hand typing:
```
bat = character(name='Bat', max_hp=1)
hero = character(name='Hero', max_hp=20)
```
(there are a looooot of characters in his sheet so hand typing it is a nightmare)"
1561,2019-04-08T10:47:14.846600,Johna,though the end goal is probably a flask app so i’m thinking this may be a bad approach? store the data in a database and call it as needed?
1561,2019-04-08T10:48:08.847300,Johna,"but let’s say it wasn’t a flask app and i wanted to create characters in like, pygame or kivy or something… would a database still be the best approach?"
1561,2019-04-08T10:49:27.848300,Johna,i started getting into that terrible space of looping through a csv and using `exec()` with f strings which i know is not usually a good idea…. but i can’t think of another way to do it?
1561,2019-04-08T10:49:50.848500,Jimmy,I would use sqlite
1561,2019-04-08T10:50:01.849000,Jimmy,you don't need a whole database server and it's easy to move around
1561,2019-04-08T10:50:09.849300,Johna,yeah… i saw that pandas has a to_sqlite function i think
1561,2019-04-08T10:50:25.849700,Johna,might be an easy way to convert a csv to a database
1561,2019-04-08T10:50:43.850000,Johna,"i see, i didn’t know that about sqlite"
1561,2019-04-08T10:52:08.851200,Jimmy,your brother could even use something like sqllite browser to go and modify some values
1561,2019-04-08T10:52:15.851400,Johna,oh? i’ll check that out

1561,2019-04-08T13:04:42.855200,Sasha,"<@Johna> In the absence of a database, you could create the objects in a data structure. Like instead of having a separate variable for each one, use a dict where the objects are the values: `chars[name] = character(name=name, max_hp=hp)`."

1563,2019-04-08T13:22:43.859200,Ludie,Nothing prints when i check against the second iteration there
1563,2019-04-08T13:24:22.860300,Sasha,"I think you would want something like:
```for item in data['components']:
   for subitem in item['components']:```"
1563,2019-04-08T13:24:59.860600,Ludie,let me try it out
1563,2019-04-08T13:25:23.861100,Sasha,"Although in this case the second item has no `'components'` entry, so you may need a check for that too."
1563,2019-04-08T13:26:29.861500,Ludie,it orked! but it didn’t return the second components nested array
1563,2019-04-08T13:27:09.861700,Sasha,Can you clarify?
1563,2019-04-08T13:27:20.862000,Ludie,"Yes, sorry"
1563,2019-04-08T13:27:51.862800,Ludie,"```for item in data['components']:
   for subitem in item['components']:
      print(subitem['URL'])```"
1563,2019-04-08T13:28:02.863100,Ludie,only printed the first URL
1563,2019-04-08T13:28:40.863800,Sasha,"Did it throw an exception? As I mentioned, the second item (TITLE) has no components, so it may have errored out there."
1563,2019-04-08T13:28:55.864000,Ludie,"no, it ran fine"
1563,2019-04-08T13:29:19.864500,Ludie,(i’m using flask and the loops are within the jinja templates if that makes a difference)
1563,2019-04-08T13:30:25.865800,Sasha,"Just for kicks, try putting a check on it:
```for item in data['components']:
   if 'components' in item:
      for subitem in item['components']:
         print(subitem['URL'])```"
1563,2019-04-08T13:31:16.866000,Nola,I think I have some indentation issues in my loop and can't seem to locate how to make it work. the loop i created will only show the last data point which is red
1563,2019-04-08T13:31:36.866600,Ludie,"```{% for component in component s%}        
    {% if component.role == ""container"" %}
                {% for subcontainer in component['components'] %}
                    {% if subcontainer.role == ""photo"" %}
                        &lt;img src=""{{subcontainer.URL}}""&gt;
                    {% endif %}
                {% endfor %}
            {% endif %}
           {% endfor %}```"
1563,2019-04-08T13:31:42.866800,Ludie,apologies for the bad indentation
1563,2019-04-08T13:32:24.867400,Sasha,You have an `elif` without an `if`?
1563,2019-04-08T13:32:45.867800,Ludie,"sorry, only copied the relevant code to save you the reading time"
1563,2019-04-08T13:32:47.868100,Ludie,corrected
1563,2019-04-08T13:33:15.868200,Raguel,"after `for loop`, you need indentation (tab or 4 spaces) -- in your snippet, at line 5 and 15"
1563,2019-04-08T13:34:06.868800,Sasha,Hmmm. That looks good at first glance. You say it's running correctly but only outputting the first photo URL?
1563,2019-04-08T13:34:12.869000,Ludie,correct
1563,2019-04-08T13:34:56.869500,Ludie,oh my lord…
1563,2019-04-08T13:34:57.869800,Ludie,sorry
1563,2019-04-08T13:35:03.870000,Sasha,Is the `component s` extra space in the original code?
1563,2019-04-08T13:35:20.870500,Ludie,the second url is actually in an additional array….
1563,2019-04-08T13:35:40.871000,Ludie,so the initial solution you gave me should be enough to figure out the rest
1563,2019-04-08T13:35:43.871200,Ludie,Thanks!!!!
1563,2019-04-08T13:35:48.871500,Sasha,"Ah, fun..."
1563,2019-04-08T13:40:45.872000,Nola,"should I also indent and stack each loop?

1563,2019-04-08T14:17:03.877700,Jolanda,So I could navigate using html/body/div[2]/span[3]/p[1]
1563,2019-04-08T14:19:25.878300,Ashley,<@Jolanda> you mean xpath?
1563,2019-04-08T14:20:45.878900,Jolanda,I want to create a Dict from a html file to the end create a dynamic xpath
1563,2019-04-08T14:21:29.879300,Ashley,what are you looking to do with that? there might be an easier way
1563,2019-04-08T14:24:06.881500,Jolanda,"I need monitor changes in a website, so I 'm trying to built a tree with tags and contents so if the content of a tag changes I can detect it and drawn  a red box around the element using css"
1563,2019-04-08T14:24:34.881700,Ashley,are you monitoring this manually?
1563,2019-04-08T14:24:54.882000,Jolanda,"No, I'm using scrapy"
1563,2019-04-08T14:25:21.882200,Ashley,what's your end goal?
1563,2019-04-08T14:25:52.882800,Ashley,to just monitor changing elements?
1563,2019-04-08T14:26:22.883300,Jolanda,And draw a box around it using css:grin:
1563,2019-04-08T14:26:31.883600,Jolanda,I thought thaat should be easy
1563,2019-04-08T14:26:35.883800,Jolanda,But isn't so simple
1563,2019-04-08T14:26:36.884000,Jolanda,haha
1563,2019-04-08T14:26:43.884200,Jolanda,at least to me
1563,2019-04-08T14:28:14.884600,Ashley,why highlight if you're scraping it anyway?
1563,2019-04-08T14:28:25.884900,Ashley,or is that just your means to point scrapy at the changing elements?
1563,2019-04-08T14:29:11.885400,Jolanda,Because I need a visual evidence of changes
1563,2019-04-08T14:29:26.885700,Hiroko,is that your requirement or someone else’s?
1563,2019-04-08T14:30:26.886100,Jolanda,"Yes, client requeriment..."
1563,2019-04-08T14:30:57.886900,Ashley,what exactly is the client asking for?
1563,2019-04-08T14:31:57.888100,Clayton,What is the 'rule of thumb' for envs in Anaconda with Spyder other than the 'base' env ? Do we need a new env for every Python/ML/DL package we want to use with Spyder ?
1563,2019-04-08T14:32:32.888900,Clayton,"Also, does the new Anaconda version 2109.3 help or hinder Spyder ?"
1563,2019-04-08T14:34:05.890200,Jolanda,"<@Ashley> is exactally what I said, monitor changes in some website, take a screenshot of page highlight changed areas"
1563,2019-04-08T14:34:28.890500,Ashley,"ah, gotcha"
1563,2019-04-08T14:34:35.890800,Jolanda,I'm using scrapy + splash for that
1563,2019-04-08T14:34:56.891300,Jolanda,I tried create a dict with all elements
1563,2019-04-08T14:35:22.891900,Jolanda,from the odl html and from the new and do a intersection
1563,2019-04-08T14:35:46.892200,Jolanda,however isn't a good approach
1563,2019-04-08T14:37:22.892400,Ashley,hmmm
1563,2019-04-08T14:37:27.892700,Ashley,there may be an easier way
1563,2019-04-08T14:37:29.893000,Ashley,give me a few minutes
1563,2019-04-08T14:39:19.893800,Jolanda,I was thinking about stacks but I haven't implemented yet
1563,2019-04-08T14:43:38.895200,Ashley,"could you not just have the whole body have an onchange event listener, and then have the call back look at the actual event target and just change that?"
1563,2019-04-08T14:46:04.896200,Jolanda,"But this onchange should be implemented on the website that Am wahcing, don't? We don't have access"
1563,2019-04-08T14:53:00.898600,Ashley,so how are you planning on monitoring the elements? are you just gonna process the whole dom at certain intervals?
1563,2019-04-08T14:54:14.900100,Ashley,"(sorry, just not sure what your stack is at the moment)"
1563,2019-04-08T14:54:43.900700,Jolanda,"My scraper download the monitored pages on a folder, so I am create a hashtable of all page files, so if one change the scraper will download and compare with the cached html file"
1563,2019-04-08T14:55:06.901200,Ashley,ahhhh I gotcha
1563,2019-04-08T14:55:08.901400,Jolanda,this will be done some times during the day
1563,2019-04-08T14:55:10.901500,Ashley,I thought this was a live thing
1563,2019-04-08T14:55:16.901800,Jolanda,No no
1563,2019-04-08T14:55:17.901900,Ashley,like without reloading the page
1563,2019-04-08T14:55:57.902300,Ashley,"ok, I would just ""prettify"" the HTML, and call a diff on it"
1563,2019-04-08T14:56:31.902900,Ashley,"when there's a line with a diff, find the wrapping tag on the line before it, and then generate an XPATH for that"
1563,2019-04-08T14:57:21.903400,Jolanda,"Yeah, the problem is generate the xpath using this style"
1563,2019-04-08T14:58:16.904300,Ashley,you can rely on the indentation from the prettifying process
1563,2019-04-08T14:58:46.904600,Ashley,start at the line of the wrapping tag
1563,2019-04-08T14:58:53.904900,Ashley,then work your way up the file line by line
1563,2019-04-08T15:00:27.905700,Ashley,"check the indentation, and if it matches the wrapping tag, then you know it's not the parent, but if it's the same indentation and tag name, then you can increase the count for that layer"
1563,2019-04-08T15:00:46.906100,Ashley,"if the indentation is more, then you can ignor the line, and if it's less, you have the parent"
1563,2019-04-08T15:01:05.906600,Ashley,"if it's less, you can then update the indentation amount you check for to be that"
1563,2019-04-08T15:02:29.906800,Ashley,that'll build your xpath
1563,2019-04-08T15:05:12.907700,Jolanda,"Nice, <@Ashley> I never would think in this approach"
1563,2019-04-08T15:05:22.908000,Jolanda,I'm going to try it
1563,2019-04-08T15:05:30.908200,Ashley,:+1:
1563,2019-04-08T15:05:34.908500,Ashley,good luck!

If the keys are themselves data, coming from user input, or a file, or whatever, then you probably want a dict. If the keys are under your control as a programmer and are more or less fixed in your code, then you probably want a class instead."

this is very similar to <@Chuck>'s approach, but this goes for partial matches, isn't a list comprehension so it won't give you a list of indexes back, and will stop on the first match it finds instead of iterating over the whole list, so it's faster. But if you need all indexes that it's found in, go with <@Chuck>’s approach (but switch `==` for `in` and flip them around).

if you do know the complete string:

```
index = my_list.index(my_string)

If you need all matches though, <@Chuck> approach will find them all"

1589,2019-04-09T15:29:49.031100,Frankie,FYI I ended up finding a decent way to handle multiple time formats

1589,2019-04-09T15:33:04.032800,Frankie,Feel free to critique if you see any way to make it better but it works well so far for handling all the formats I've come across :slightly_smiling_face:
1590,2019-04-09T17:19:02.038900,Mi,"Hi! Is there anybody who uses behave? I need to find the way how to parametrize Example based on environment I use. Something like:
```
    @use.with_stage=develop
    Examples: Araxas
      | name  | birthyear |
      | Alice |  1985     |

    @use.with_stage=integration
    Examples:
      | name   | birthyear |
      | Charly |  1995     |
```
I tried to use that way but
1. It tries to find develop or integration folders (like  `develop_steps`) but the example from docs uses the default folder…have no idea my version looks folder"

1592,2019-04-09T23:18:05.003400,Scot,Why 5^2 equals 7 but 5**2 equals 25 in python?I thought the answer to be 25 for both the cases.
1592,2019-04-09T23:18:29.003800,Scot,What does '^' mean in python?
1592,2019-04-09T23:24:40.004900,Sasha,It's the exclusive-or (XOR) bitwise operator. So `0b0101 ^ 0b0010 == 0b0111` in binary.
1592,2019-04-10T00:24:57.006100,Scot,Thanks <@Sasha>
1593,2019-04-10T00:49:04.006500,Scot,"I am having problem in understanding how the assignment of variables are taking place,what value is assigned in a and b throughout the iterations."
1593,2019-04-10T00:59:26.009100,Sasha,"The comma is essentially doing two assignments at once, so `a, b = b, a+b` is equivalent to:
```temp1 = b
temp2 = a+b
a = temp1
b = temp2```
But note that it's not quite equivalent to:
```a = b
b = a+b```
because you don't want `a` to be altered before its old value can be used in the second part."

1594,2019-04-10T02:38:04.011700,Leida,depends on your frontend but sure
1594,2019-04-10T02:38:36.011900,Leida,stuff like <https://www.qt.io/qt-for-python>

1597,2019-04-10T07:15:39.022800,Conchita,I started working on some other people's code today (for the first time ever). One thing I see is that in one function they have added to `if` statements after eachother and no else block. My reflex is that the second `if` statement should be converted to `else`
1597,2019-04-10T07:16:39.024100,Jimmy,it depends what it does
1597,2019-04-10T07:16:48.024300,Conchita,"```
def foo():
    if x == 'poo':
         # do this
    if x == 'shoo':
         # do this```"
1597,2019-04-10T07:17:15.024700,Jimmy,in this case it looks like it could be `if` &amp; `elif`
1597,2019-04-10T07:18:08.026200,Jimmy,"```
if x % 2 == 0:
  # stuff
if x % 3 == 0:
  # stuff
```"
1597,2019-04-10T07:18:18.026500,Jimmy,in a case like that the behavior would change
1597,2019-04-10T07:18:32.026900,Jimmy,because if `x ` is 6 it would execute both `if`
1597,2019-04-10T07:20:03.028400,Conchita,Aha. Well in this case it's one or the other. What happens in the first `if` statement will never execute the second `if` statement
1597,2019-04-10T07:20:55.029100,Hiroko,not really
1597,2019-04-10T07:21:09.029800,Hiroko,multiple `if` statements will execute if the conditions match
1597,2019-04-10T07:21:35.030200,Hiroko,`if` and `elif` will execute only one of the many you can put in sequence
1597,2019-04-10T07:21:48.030800,Hiroko,`else` will always execute if none of the others have
1597,2019-04-10T07:22:11.031400,Hiroko,is that what you’re curious about?
1597,2019-04-10T07:22:41.031800,Conchita,"I meant that with the specific code I'm working on now, the conditions will only match with one of the `if` blocks."
1597,2019-04-10T07:23:51.033200,Hiroko,"ok, but can the params change to match the others?"
1597,2019-04-10T07:24:06.033800,Hiroko,"you said its a function, are there arguments for the function?"
1597,2019-04-10T07:25:59.035700,Conchita,It takes in a JSON request and the `if` condition is checking the source of the post request (not sure if I'm using the correct terms here)
1597,2019-04-10T07:27:33.036800,Conchita,ie `if request['source']['Slack'] == True` or `if request['source']['Discord'] == True`
1597,2019-04-10T07:28:11.037100,Hiroko,ok.   so that function is flexible
1597,2019-04-10T07:28:36.037600,Hiroko,you can pass in a json request from whatever sources it looks for and it’ll handle the thing with specific logic
1597,2019-04-10T07:28:55.038200,Hiroko,"if its not being used now, it could have been in the past or is anticipated to be used in the future"
1597,2019-04-10T07:31:06.039200,Conchita,"Gotcha, makes more sense now. Thanks for the help <@Jimmy> <@Hiroko> this is a :taco: One thing I'm learning in this process is that its much easier writing code than reading it lol"
1597,2019-04-10T07:31:15.039400,Hiroko,yep
1597,2019-04-10T07:31:36.039900,Hiroko,but you might have had a similar experience if you look at your own code you wrote last year :slightly_smiling_face:
1597,2019-04-10T07:31:54.040600,Hiroko,since all the details for the “why” are long gone from short term memory
1597,2019-04-10T07:32:21.041600,Hiroko,lets just say I’ve had more than a few instances of “what idiot wrote this stuff?”  … said idiot was me
1597,2019-04-10T07:32:25.041900,Hiroko,:smile:
1597,2019-04-10T07:32:29.042000,Conchita,Exactly had this experience a few days ago when taking a look at the first script I made
1597,2019-04-10T07:32:33.042200,Conchita,hahaha
1597,2019-04-10T07:32:59.042900,Hiroko,thats why there’s such a focus on readability with code
1597,2019-04-10T07:33:02.043100,Conchita,Well my goal is to make future me think present me is a complete imbecile
1597,2019-04-10T07:33:12.043400,Hiroko,a very admirable one!
1597,2019-04-10T07:33:39.043800,Jimmy,I'd start to worry when that's not the case :smile:
1597,2019-04-10T07:33:53.044000,Hiroko,yep
1597,2019-04-10T07:34:13.044800,Hiroko,that’s when you start to fossilize and not keep growing in knowledge and competence
1597,2019-04-10T07:34:42.046000,Hiroko,thinking you know everythign and don’t need to learn because it was tried 5 years ago and didn’t work is the worst place to be
1597,2019-04-10T07:34:54.046300,Conchita,I have this rule that if I can't remember something that I'm embarrassed about from the previous month I need to change something. Meaning I'm too relaxed with xyz
1597,2019-04-10T07:35:37.046500,Conchita,Ah one more thing
1597,2019-04-10T07:36:05.047300,Conchita,Is `if condition` the same as `if condition == True` equal?
1597,2019-04-10T07:36:47.047600,Jimmy,no
1597,2019-04-10T07:37:46.048100,Jimmy,`if x` check that x is `thruthy`
1597,2019-04-10T07:38:03.048600,Jimmy,a non-empty string would enter it for example
1597,2019-04-10T07:38:08.048800,Conchita,"""truthy"" lol"
1597,2019-04-10T07:38:18.049000,Jimmy,yeah no idea how to say that :smile:
1597,2019-04-10T07:38:48.049600,Conchita,"So it checks that ""condition is not NaN"""

1604,2019-04-10T12:18:19.093100,Elwanda,this is for a school project
1604,2019-04-10T12:18:20.093200,Elwanda,thats y
1604,2019-04-10T12:18:39.093600,Claudine,"see the plus button on the left of where you're typing? hit that and click ""code or text snippet"" and post code in there"

1604,2019-04-10T12:19:07.094600,Claudine,your issue is you're missing a closing `)`
1604,2019-04-10T12:19:14.094900,Elwanda,None
1604,2019-04-10T12:19:20.095300,Claudine,the one immediately after your `elif` is not closed at the end
1604,2019-04-10T12:19:57.095500,Elwanda,should i close it after or ?
1604,2019-04-10T12:20:36.096000,Claudine,"it seems like you're trying to wrap that whole thing, so i'd close it at the very end after `won a game"")`"
1604,2019-04-10T12:20:57.096500,Claudine,"```
You originally typed:
elif  (button1 [""text""] == ""O"" and button2 [""text""] == ""O"" and button3 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button4 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button6 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button7 [""text""] == ""O"" and button8 [""text""] == ""O"" and button9 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button3 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button7 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button1 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button9 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button1 [""text""] == ""O"" and button4 [""text""] == ""O"" and button7 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button2 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button8 [""text""] == ""O"" or

          tkinter.messagebox.showinfo(""Winner O"", ""You have just won a game"")

You probabaly want:
elif  (button1 [""text""] == ""O"" and button2 [""text""] == ""O"" and button3 [""text""] == ""O"" or
         button4 [""text""] == ""O"" and button5 [""text""] == ""O"" and button6 [""text""] == ""O"" or

1604,2019-04-10T12:21:33.096800,Elwanda,ok thanks man u saved my ass :joy:
1604,2019-04-10T12:22:14.097200,Elwanda,its still showing invalid syntax :disappointed_relieved:
1604,2019-04-10T12:22:45.097600,Claudine,do you need a `:` at the end too? and to fill out that `elif` statement?
1604,2019-04-10T12:23:26.097800,Elwanda,no ithink so
1604,2019-04-10T12:24:24.098500,Claudine,in th ebig chunk of unformatted code you posted there are two `elif` statements that do not have the `:` at the end
1604,2019-04-10T12:24:42.099100,Claudine,"you have one of those statements, then
```
     #123
     #456
     #789
```
then a second"
1604,2019-04-10T12:24:52.099500,Elwanda,where should i put : ?
1604,2019-04-10T12:26:39.101300,Claudine,"see how before you did `elif buttons [""text""] == "" "" and click == False:`?
the `:` just means it's the end of the `if` or `elif` check and everything after is what your doing if that statement is true.
in the case of your broken code it goes in the same spot, just a bit confusing since that statment is spread across so many lines
the `:` would go here: `... won a game"")):`"
1604,2019-04-10T12:27:20.102000,Claudine,"everything in between the open parenthesis `elif (` and the closing parenthesis `game""))` is part of that same `elif`"
1604,2019-04-10T12:27:46.102100,Elwanda,now this problem i have
1604,2019-04-10T12:28:57.102500,Claudine,yea that makes sense
1604,2019-04-10T12:29:51.103400,Claudine,"see where you have:
```
   #123
   #456
   #789
```
those are commented out lines, so essentially the `elif` before those numbers has no body, so it doesn't expect to see another `elif`"
1604,2019-04-10T12:30:10.103900,Elwanda,so i remove it ?
1604,2019-04-10T12:30:15.104100,Claudine,"so you'd have to add some boyd logic to that first `elif`, even just a `print('hey') or something would work"
1604,2019-04-10T12:30:33.104500,Claudine,"if you remove it youll still have the problem, you just need some sort of operation or logic in between"
1604,2019-04-10T12:30:40.104900,Elwanda,like ?
1604,2019-04-10T12:31:05.105300,Claudine,"literally anything
`foo = 1`
`1 + 1`"
1604,2019-04-10T12:31:17.105600,Claudine,`print()`
1604,2019-04-10T12:31:18.105700,Elwanda,replace with elif right ?
1604,2019-04-10T12:32:49.105800,Elwanda,wht about this ?
1604,2019-04-10T12:33:08.106200,Claudine,no
1604,2019-04-10T12:33:13.106400,Claudine,here....
1604,2019-04-10T12:33:25.106800,Claudine,None
1604,2019-04-10T12:33:29.107200,Genesis,Wow... I feel like there has got to be a better way to write that logic
1604,2019-04-10T12:33:44.107400,Claudine,What i posted was your original code
1604,2019-04-10T12:33:49.107700,Elwanda,oh k
1604,2019-04-10T12:33:51.107900,Claudine,you want to  make these updates:
1604,2019-04-10T12:33:54.108200,Elwanda,ok
1604,2019-04-10T12:34:54.109400,Genesis,What about `all([button['text'] == 'x' for button in buttons])`
1604,2019-04-10T12:35:09.110100,Genesis,Your entire if statement can be written like that :point_up:
1604,2019-04-10T12:35:16.110200,Elwanda,i thought of that. Will it work ? :point_up_2:
1604,2019-04-10T12:35:18.110300,Claudine,None
1604,2019-04-10T12:36:05.111800,Genesis,"You can also do 
```
If 'x' == button1 == button2 == buttton3:
```"
1604,2019-04-10T12:36:11.112100,Genesis,No need for all the ands
1604,2019-04-10T12:36:39.112700,Claudine,yea you can simplify a whole ton
1604,2019-04-10T12:37:48.112900,Elwanda,now it comes like this? Wht the heck is wrong
1604,2019-04-10T12:39:57.113900,Claudine,"the error message is correct, python requires very specific indenting"
1604,2019-04-10T12:40:19.114600,Elwanda,i am failing in my python project

1604,2019-04-10T12:40:31.115100,Claudine,"in this case you're doing
```
if (somecondition):
foo()

you need
```
if (somcondition):
    foo()

1604,2019-04-10T12:40:41.115400,Claudine,dont worry about it man :slightly_smiling_face:
1604,2019-04-10T12:41:09.116100,Elwanda,None
1604,2019-04-10T12:41:35.116800,Claudine,"the body of an `if` or `elif` statements needs to be indented, python only knows the `if`/`elif` statement has ended when it sees stuff on the same indentation level as the `if`"
1604,2019-04-10T12:42:04.117400,Claudine,whatcha doing with `buttons=StringVar ()` there that looks odd
1604,2019-04-10T12:42:17.117800,Claudine,all that stuff should be indented consistently
1604,2019-04-10T12:42:24.118000,Elwanda,i am actually creating an game
1604,2019-04-10T12:42:54.118300,Claudine,do this:
1604,2019-04-10T12:43:19.118400,Claudine,None
1604,2019-04-10T12:43:56.119100,Elwanda,whats the change ?
1604,2019-04-10T12:44:01.119300,Claudine,the indentation
1604,2019-04-10T12:44:10.119700,Claudine,see how they are all indented consistently?
1604,2019-04-10T12:44:48.120400,Claudine,"in yours you have
```
buttons=...
    button1...
```
in this it's
```
buttons=...
button1...
```"
1604,2019-04-10T12:44:58.120700,Claudine,python is strict about indentation
1604,2019-04-10T12:45:09.121000,Elwanda,ok
1604,2019-04-10T12:45:13.121300,Elwanda,let me try
1604,2019-04-10T12:45:20.121500,Claudine,it was awkward for me at first too but once you get used to it it makes a lot of sense and keeps your code neat and readable
1604,2019-04-10T12:46:07.121800,Elwanda,still the same error is coming :disappointed_relieved:
1604,2019-04-10T12:47:13.122100,Claudine,oh it's because those all come right after the `elif` above that
1604,2019-04-10T12:47:44.122800,Claudine,if they are supposed to be part of that `elif` statment they need to be indented 1 level more than the `elif`
1604,2019-04-10T12:47:59.123300,Elwanda,so i should ?
1604,2019-04-10T12:48:05.123500,Claudine,if they are not supposed to part of the `elif` than you just need something in the body of the `elif`
1604,2019-04-10T12:49:07.124700,Claudine,im not 100% sure what your trying to do so it's hard to say. do you want to run all that `button` stuff from within the `elif` statement right above them? if so then indent them 1 level more than the elif. if they're not part of the elif then give the elif some body logic
1604,2019-04-10T12:49:52.125200,Claudine,it could help to brush up on some python tutorials about indentation and formatting too
1604,2019-04-10T12:50:12.125700,Elwanda,Do you know the game X and O?
1604,2019-04-10T12:50:16.126100,Elwanda,i am making that
1604,2019-04-10T12:50:23.126300,Claudine,tic tac toe yea i saw it in your code
1604,2019-04-10T12:50:37.126700,Elwanda,yeah :joy::stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
1604,2019-04-10T12:50:54.127100,Claudine,"im also just trying to point you in the right direction so you recognize your own mistakes, rather than just give you correct code"
1604,2019-04-10T12:51:12.127300,Elwanda,oh..
1604,2019-04-10T12:51:16.127500,Elwanda,yeah
1604,2019-04-10T12:51:18.127700,Claudine,:smile:
1604,2019-04-10T12:51:23.127900,Claudine,i dont wanna do your homework for you :smile:
1604,2019-04-10T12:51:26.128200,Elwanda,:ok_hand:
1604,2019-04-10T12:53:01.128400,Elwanda,So what do i do now ?
1604,2019-04-10T12:55:56.129500,Elwanda,i got it correct
1604,2019-04-10T12:55:56.129600,Claudine,lol i dunno dude. let me rephrase what I said and walk you through it again
1604,2019-04-10T12:55:59.129900,Claudine,oh you got it?
1604,2019-04-10T12:56:00.130000,Elwanda,yeahh....
1604,2019-04-10T12:56:04.130200,Elwanda,but i prob
1604,2019-04-10T12:56:08.130400,Elwanda,when i run it
1604,2019-04-10T12:56:35.130900,Claudine,i mean step 1 is getting it to actually run so thats great
1604,2019-04-10T12:56:43.131100,Elwanda,None
1604,2019-04-10T12:57:19.132000,Claudine,well that's a pretty straightforward error isn't it? it's telling you that no such thing as `T1` exists
1604,2019-04-10T12:57:32.132300,Claudine,did you define something called `T1` in your file?
1604,2019-04-10T12:57:39.132500,Elwanda,wait let me see
1604,2019-04-10T12:57:51.132700,Elwanda,tk = t1
1604,2019-04-10T12:57:59.132900,Elwanda,tk = t1()
1604,2019-04-10T12:58:02.133100,Elwanda,i did this
1604,2019-04-10T12:58:24.133400,Elwanda,its suppose to be tk not tl
1604,2019-04-10T12:58:30.133700,Elwanda,i am soo dumb :joy:
1604,2019-04-10T12:58:31.133800,Claudine,well there ya go

I have that all working but just realized that the transactions need to be grouped and summed by the hour and minute they occurred or else they override each other.   I could put all the data into a dictionary, and before inserting each record, search the dictionary and add a sum of the values to any  matching record with the same minute and hour.  I am wondering if there is a cleaner way to do it though.  It’s the equivalent of inserting all the data into a sql table and then issuing a select statement with a group by."

For some reason a recent Homebrew update on my Mac (Mojave) got messed up and shat all over itself — I can no longer access Python 2.7, etc. I decided that I’d remove and reinstall Homebrew: get it back to system Python, and then reinstall Homebrew fresh atop a clean Mojave system Python.

I uninstalled via the usual call to the uninstall script, which completed, but said that there was a problem with the Ruby environment manager, `rbenv`. Isn’t rbenv maintained by homebrew?

Can I get away with removing rbenv too? Or even just by blowing away the dotfolder for it?"

I use a Raspberry Pi as a little web server to help me get to grips with Python, and to familiarize myself with general linux type syntax at the same time. I come from a Windows background, so i'm no pro at Linux at all.

My issue is this : The Pi comes with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 pre-installed. From what i can see ""pip"" is also installed by default, so...

I have installed some flask packages ( modules ?? ) with pip install &lt;package&gt;, but unbeknownst to me, when i tried to import some flask modules using the Python3 interpreter ( think that's what you call it ), it complains that those packages cannot be imported as they don't ""exist"". My research led me to understand that pip installed the packages to the Python 2.7 site-packages folder instead of the site-packages for python3 ( as this is my default interpreter ). I verified that this was the case by running :

pip show &lt;package name&gt;

So my question is - how do i now move these packages from the Python 2.7 site-packages folder to the Python3 site-packages folder, and then force pip to install all future packages inside Python3's site-packages folder ?

Thanks"
1635,2019-04-12T01:51:20.015800,Virgil,"<@Celinda> The simplest way would be to install packages using `pip3`, like `pip3 install flask`
If it gives you an error, saying that pip3 was not found, just try `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`"
1635,2019-04-12T01:52:44.016700,Celinda,thanks <@Virgil> - would i have to uninstall the other packages i mistakenly installed under 2.7 first ?
1635,2019-04-12T01:54:01.018000,Virgil,"You don't have to, they would not conflict with your Python3 packages. I would suggest you to use virtual environments instead of using global packages."
1635,2019-04-12T01:55:01.018900,Celinda,"Yeah - I head about venv - I'll have to go read up on how to enable that. Thing is my web app is already built, so im not sure how to move all of it under a venv ?"
1635,2019-04-12T01:57:12.020700,Virgil,"if you want to use python3, just install `sudo apt-get install python3-venv` and then inside your project directory or somewhere else (your preference) create a venv using `python3 -m venv &lt;any_name_for_venv&gt;`
To activate the venv, `source '&lt;path_to_venv&gt;/bin/activate`"
1635,2019-04-12T01:57:52.021500,Virgil,"after activating the venv, you can install specific packages inside that venv"
1635,2019-04-12T02:15:31.022000,Celinda,Thank you - also watched this video which was very helpful : <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5vscPTWKOk>
1635,2019-04-12T02:16:38.022400,Virgil,Cool!
1635,2019-04-12T05:32:16.024700,Celinda,OK great <@Virgil> ! - your command actually worked for me and the command in the video above didn't work for me ( maybe it's MAC only ). I think i understand how virtual environments work now. Its pretty neat !

1636,2019-04-12T06:06:41.034000,Wilber,Ah probably has to do with how google functions is calling it then? Sorry I'm not familiar with them.  Does the error give a stack trace? You can also try adding an argument to your `publish` method and then logging it to see what its expecting
1636,2019-04-12T06:12:56.034800,Conchita,Yeah this stuff is a bit confusing. I'll try a few different approaches here
1636,2019-04-12T06:17:34.035400,Wilber,"Oh, my assumption is that when google functions is trying to run the function it always passes the `request` argument"
1636,2019-04-12T06:18:25.035800,Wilber,So you might need to define the publish function with that argument (like it is with `run`)
1636,2019-04-12T06:19:40.036000,Conchita,"Aha, gotcha!"
1636,2019-04-12T06:19:42.036300,Conchita,That makes sense

1637,2019-04-12T05:53:42.028200,Wilber,Can you post the code where you call `publish`?
1637,2019-04-12T05:55:00.029100,Wilber,If its being called as a class method then it will be automatically passing the class instance as the first argument

The words should appear at same position they would when sorting normally. Thee series of functions I've laid out cannot handle 'DRUGS'. They throw a ValueError.

1641,2019-04-12T13:52:01.089600,Nenita,per that link - random question here - but i saw 'if key in mapping'. Does the keyword 'in' work like enumerate or like a dictionary pointer(dict[key])?
1641,2019-04-12T13:58:49.091300,Clemmie,that formula asks “is the value held by `key` in the iterable `mapping`
1641,2019-04-12T13:59:45.092100,Nenita,i see
1641,2019-04-12T14:00:04.092700,Sasha,"The behavior can vary depending on what `mapping` is. If it's an iterable, it'll loop through and see whether one of the values is equal to `key`. If it's a dict, it will directly see whether `key` is one of the keys in the dict."
1641,2019-04-12T14:00:33.093200,Nenita,ah thanks. that definitely clears the fog up

so i kind of lose my spot, and after the first iteration, i'm at the end of the file

1646,2019-04-12T16:17:59.113500,Sasha,Then `collections.Counter()` is probably your friend.
1646,2019-04-12T16:18:15.113800,Clemmie,what flexibility do you need? for this sort of question SQL sure sounds like the right ansewer
1646,2019-04-12T16:18:54.114800,Sasha,"(I mean, normally the more data you're dealing with, the more you want to get the database to deal with locally.)"

1646,2019-04-12T16:19:12.115400,Joette,if not SQL - which would be the first thing I'd reach for too - then Pandas
1646,2019-04-12T16:19:40.116100,Nenita,pandas is my best friend. i just am trying to figure a good formula that i can just shove all the data into.
1646,2019-04-12T16:20:08.116800,Joette,though if the query is taking forever that suggests other issues (e.g. indexing) and not the DB per se
1646,2019-04-12T16:20:24.117900,Nenita,i did this to step by step figure out what the best method would be
1646,2019-04-12T16:20:57.119000,Nenita,"yea, our db is setup with ms access over firebird odbc and ms access is a pain, but effective."
1646,2019-04-12T16:21:16.119700,Nenita,"and sometimes when i run queries on certain tables, access just crashes so im looking to avoid that all together"
1646,2019-04-12T16:21:18.119900,Joette,"... I cannot remember the method/function but Pandas does have a facility for aggregating by say, the hour, of a timestamp in a column"
1646,2019-04-12T16:21:37.120400,Joette,I spent a lot of time researching how to do it but then abandoned it b/c it wasn't the right fit for what I was working on
1646,2019-04-12T16:22:15.121000,Nenita,"but with this screenshot, i dont even know if i am doing the math right"
1646,2019-04-12T16:22:46.121600,Joette,in Excel I'd create a column extracting the hour from each time and then use a PivotTable
1646,2019-04-12T16:23:38.122600,Nenita,"a pivot table is a good idea to start, havent had much reason to use a pivottable, but that will surely speed things up"

1646,2019-04-12T17:51:42.136000,Hiroko,I’ve found you need to invalidate caches and restart sometimes with pycharm to pick up new packages when you install outside it
1646,2019-04-12T17:52:03.136500,Hiroko,"so if you’re hsing troulble picking up packages, <@Clayton>, that could be why"

1651,2019-04-13T00:47:25.155200,Tam,"Hello everyone, thanks for the enormous help you've been providing us in the channels. I do have a small question about how apps like Slack here, Telegram, WhatsApp or those Android app clients used to speak in real time are implemented, theoretically speaking.

I'm not sure how it works, so I think of this scenario, assuming Slack here is Telegram one-on-one private chat:

I'm texting you now, this message gets sent to the Telegram server(and the government maybe?), then to your client and it appears almost immediately as if it wasn't routed to any intermediaries. Your Telegram client picks it up almost immediately I send it here. How do you think your Telegram client gets the message? Does it *probe/poke* the Telegram server on timely basis checking for any updates or does the Telegram server just notify the client app magically? I mean sort of like how `conditional_variable::wait()` and `::notify()` works locally when used with mutexes from different threads."
1652,2019-04-13T02:18:05.155800,Serina,"Hi! I'd really appreciate your help.
I am new to python and was trying to write unit tests. I am kind of stuck trying to mock user input. Is there something I am missing?
This is what my code looks like:

```
class GetInput:

    def __init__(self):
        self.key1 = os.environ['key1']
        self.key2 = os.environ['key2']
        self.fruits = []

    def get(self):
        try:
            while True:
                user_input = self.fruit_input()
                if user_input == 'apple':
                    print('you entered apple')
                    return

                self.fruits.append(user_input)

                if user_input == 'mango':
                    # call other method(user_input)
                    return
        except:
            #log error

    def fruit_input(self):
        user_input = input('Enter Fruit')
        return user_input

rs = GetInput()
rs.get()

```

Test Cases:
```
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from fruit import GetInput

class FruitTest(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('fruit.GetInput.fruit_input', return_value='apple')
    def test_user_input(self, input):
        self.assertEqual(GetInput.get(), 'you entered apple')
```"
1652,2019-04-13T02:22:19.156700,Sasha,"So one thing that looks weird is `GetInput.get()`, since you're calling it like a class method. You should probably create an object, like `GetInput().get()`."
1652,2019-04-13T02:26:57.156800,Serina,"I did that <@Sasha>; This is what it throws
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'GetInput()`"
1652,2019-04-13T02:28:26.157100,Serina,"Also made this change `@patch('GetInput().get().fruit_input', return_value='apple')` in test case"
1652,2019-04-13T02:28:36.157300,Sasha,"I meant in your `assertEqual` statement, not the `patch`."
1652,2019-04-13T02:29:58.157500,Serina,I did that in `assert`. But I think its not going past `patch`. It's throwing error there
1652,2019-04-13T02:31:04.157800,Sasha,"I agree, that's definitely going to be wrong in your patch. You probably want `'fruit.GetInput.fruit_input'` there, but I'm not 100% sure."
1652,2019-04-13T02:33:12.158100,Serina,"Sure. Thanks though! :+1::slightly_smiling_face:
I will keep trying"
1652,2019-04-13T02:34:30.158300,Sasha,Are you still getting an error?
1652,2019-04-13T02:39:04.158600,Serina,"Yes.
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fruit.GetInput'; 'fruit' is not a package`

This is how my patch looks like
`@patch('fruit.GetInput.get.self.fruit_input', return_value='apple')`"
1652,2019-04-13T02:40:03.158900,Sasha,"You may want to ask for further help in #testing_, as this is probably an easy question for someone more familiar with mocks."
1652,2019-04-13T02:40:44.159100,Sasha,"You might need `patch.object()`, for instance."
1652,2019-04-13T02:42:46.159400,Serina,"So, something like this?
a = patch.object()

@a('fruit.GetInput.get.self.fruit_input', return_value='apple')"
1652,2019-04-13T02:47:37.159600,Sasha,"Heh, I'm sure that's wrong, but I couldn't tell you the right way, sorry."
1652,2019-04-13T02:50:11.159800,Serina,No problem. Thank you <@Sasha>

1655,2019-04-13T08:19:56.173200,Monica,"what do you mean, specifically?

Well, what aspect of Python are you using?"

1655,2019-04-13T08:24:10.177800,Erika,i'm willing to learn any framework/package to make that happen :slightly_smiling_face:
1655,2019-04-13T08:24:14.177900,Monica,"to be honest, if you're struggling with it, I would consider trying out Expo/React"
1655,2019-04-13T08:25:42.179700,Monica,it's a framework that reminds of Ruby on Rails for mobile apps. Really easy to get an app testable on Android. You'll see what I mean
1655,2019-04-13T08:26:01.180200,Erika,i understand what you are saying
1655,2019-04-13T08:26:15.181000,Erika,okay so here is a stupid question:
1655,2019-04-13T08:26:18.181200,Monica,sorry I should have said Expo + React Native
1655,2019-04-13T08:26:29.181500,Erika,how do I use a python class in a Java application?
1655,2019-04-13T08:26:40.181800,Monica,what do you need it to do?
1655,2019-04-13T08:27:23.182600,Erika,apologies I can't disclose sensitive IP
1655,2019-04-13T08:27:28.182900,Erika,but essetially
1655,2019-04-13T08:27:37.183300,Monica,I don't need the IP.
1655,2019-04-13T08:27:57.183900,Monica,"Just a 30,000 foot view"
1655,2019-04-13T08:28:25.185200,Erika,in python classes
1655,2019-04-13T08:29:31.186900,Monica,"When it comes to opencv, you're asking for some real hell if you try to use it outside of a Python script"
1655,2019-04-13T08:29:38.187100,Monica,but the other things ...
1655,2019-04-13T08:29:48.187300,Erika,hehehe i assumed as much
1655,2019-04-13T08:29:56.187700,Monica,the others aren't nearly as bad
1655,2019-04-13T08:30:02.187800,Erika,that's why i was pushing for a native python app
1655,2019-04-13T08:30:07.188100,Monica,Gotcha
1655,2019-04-13T08:30:09.188300,Monica,that makes sense
1655,2019-04-13T08:30:15.188500,Monica,and that's why I was asking
1655,2019-04-13T08:30:27.188800,Monica,is OpenCv crucial to your application?
1655,2019-04-13T08:30:31.189000,Erika,yes
1655,2019-04-13T08:30:47.189300,Monica,"ok, in that case, scrap what I said about Expo + React"
1655,2019-04-13T08:31:10.189700,Erika,hehe
1655,2019-04-13T08:31:32.190200,Erika,i think a good start would be to say hello world and then I can take it from there
1655,2019-04-13T08:31:51.190800,Erika,"so I can learn the python build pipeline, you know?"
1655,2019-04-13T08:31:58.191000,Erika,so let me rephrase the question:
1655,2019-04-13T08:34:03.193600,Erika,"I know that I am going to end up devving a custom solution away, i just need a base that works"
1655,2019-04-13T08:35:24.195000,Monica,"as a python developer, I haven't written any code for android, so I'm definitely not the best to answer that question.

As a general rule, the further you get from creating a to-do list, the more fundamental software development knowledge you will need. An android app with CV capability is about as far as you can get from it.

I see that buildozer has an installation guide. Have you followed at least those steps?"
1655,2019-04-13T08:36:50.196100,Erika,i have downloaded the buildozer and python-for-anroid master branches but keep having to alter the source code to move past building and config errors
1655,2019-04-13T08:37:33.197100,Monica,did you make sure you're running python 3?
1655,2019-04-13T08:37:34.197200,Erika,"so i'm running two projects parralel:
project 1: Buildozer and p4a route
project 2: any alternative method"
1655,2019-04-13T08:37:45.197500,Erika,yeah python3 all the way
1655,2019-04-13T08:38:35.199000,Erika,"i'll get the buildozer approach working eventually, but I just feel like somewhere there has to be a better way. what are other devs doing? you know?"
1655,2019-04-13T08:39:37.200000,Monica,"I would expect other devs to write the Android app in Java, since that's the main language for the android platform and it also has OpenCV api in Java"
1655,2019-04-13T08:40:08.200600,Erika,"""and it also has OpenCV api in Java"" -- this makes my life easier"
1655,2019-04-13T08:40:23.200900,Monica,it would probably be less work in the long run for you to learn Java than to try to sort this out in Python
1655,2019-04-13T08:40:33.201300,Monica,"^ that may sound crazy, but I'm telling you that from experience"
1655,2019-04-13T08:40:55.201800,Erika,"i know java well etc. I want to take the route that minimises technical debt, you know?"
1655,2019-04-13T08:41:27.202500,Monica,always go with the more documented option when doing nontrivial things the first time. There are just way too many things you have no way of knowing otherwise.
1655,2019-04-13T08:42:39.202800,Monica,"Have you looked at these?
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMHK6NDVlCM>"
1655,2019-04-13T08:43:48.204000,Erika,"hehe yeah I have thanks. most of them don't reference package the app itself, and those who do reference packaging, do so very high level"
1655,2019-04-13T08:44:09.204800,Monica,"yeah, I would just do it in Java then"
1655,2019-04-13T08:44:19.205100,Erika,thanks :slightly_smiling_face:

1655,2019-04-13T09:19:52.206600,Monica,I do have a question

1655,2019-04-13T09:26:09.208800,Erika,hmm that sounds like a difficult one
1655,2019-04-13T09:26:55.209600,Erika,"pip is just a package manager, so go look at pip source code and determine how to do it manually?"
1655,2019-04-13T09:27:10.210100,Erika,probably like one or two lines that need to be altered?
1655,2019-04-13T09:27:15.210300,Erika,my 2 cents
1655,2019-04-13T09:31:17.210900,Monica,"say for example, I want to have access to numpy in my ED. What do I need to do to accomplish that?"
1655,2019-04-13T09:32:33.211700,Erika,damn that's a hard question. i'm going to look into it and come back to you?
1655,2019-04-13T09:32:37.211800,Monica,and how would one do an embedded distribution for a platform besides windows
1655,2019-04-13T09:33:00.212500,Monica,"they have the .zip for windows, but it contains a .exe"
1655,2019-04-13T09:33:24.213100,Raven,Most Python environments have a `Lib\site-packages` directory. 3rd party packages like Numpy live in there.
1655,2019-04-13T09:34:30.213500,Erika,yeah but those site-packages need to be built dont they?
1655,2019-04-13T09:34:37.213800,Erika,like setup.py build ?
1655,2019-04-13T09:34:40.214100,Erika,or am I wrong?
1655,2019-04-13T09:35:15.214700,Monica,the ED .zip archive for windows doesn't have that dir in there
1655,2019-04-13T09:35:23.215000,Raven,Mostly they're just plain packages
1655,2019-04-13T09:35:52.215300,Monica,ok
1655,2019-04-13T09:36:07.215700,Monica,why does windows have a very clear way to do ED and Mac doesn't?
1655,2019-04-13T09:36:27.216100,Raven,You would set the search path to whichever library directory you want

1656,2019-04-13T08:32:35.191900,Erika,what is the easiest and most reliable way to package a hello word for Android? Written in native python?
1657,2019-04-13T09:47:57.216400,Gia,Has anyone here used python in powerbi
1657,2019-04-13T09:53:11.216600,Erika,i've used R in powerbi
1657,2019-04-13T09:53:16.216800,Erika,python should be the same
1657,2019-04-13T09:53:22.217100,Erika,what are you struggling with?
1657,2019-04-13T09:53:27.217400,Gia,I want to 
1657,2019-04-13T09:53:33.217600,Gia,Use this data set
1657,2019-04-13T09:53:55.218000,Gia,Or

1657,2019-04-13T09:59:40.222000,Gia,Let me try that
1657,2019-04-13T09:59:46.222400,Gia,That is for Python
1657,2019-04-13T09:59:55.222700,Erika,df=pd.DataFrame(d)
1657,2019-04-13T09:59:55.222800,Gia,Or R
1657,2019-04-13T10:00:01.223000,Erika,that's python lol
1657,2019-04-13T10:00:05.223300,Gia,Ok
1657,2019-04-13T10:00:30.224000,Gia,Did you see that counties.json file
1657,2019-04-13T10:00:52.224500,Erika,"here is the full code:

import pandas as pd
import json
with open('countries.jon,'r') as f:
       data=f.read()

d=json.loads(data)
df=pd.DataFrame(d)"
1657,2019-04-13T10:01:57.225000,Erika,"depending on whether powerbi wants that in array or dataframe, jsut change the last step"
1657,2019-04-13T10:02:15.225600,Gia,It probably dataframe
1657,2019-04-13T10:02:23.225900,Erika,"you want to paste that code in PowerQuery, just like you would paste SQL code in custom query"
1657,2019-04-13T10:02:46.226500,Erika,is it hooked up to a SQL 2017 database? MSSQL?
1657,2019-04-13T10:03:50.227300,Gia,No
1657,2019-04-13T10:03:55.227500,Erika,"anyway it would be better to rather make the ETL process run in native python, populate a table and then hidrate it"
1657,2019-04-13T10:04:06.227900,Gia,Ahh yea
1657,2019-04-13T10:04:10.228100,Gia,I should create a sql table
1657,2019-04-13T10:04:15.228400,Erika,yeah :slightly_smiling_face:
1657,2019-04-13T10:04:17.228600,Gia,And use python native
1657,2019-04-13T10:04:26.229000,Gia,I do have psycharm on my laptop
1657,2019-04-13T10:04:30.229300,Gia,I never done that before
1657,2019-04-13T10:04:33.229400,Erika,be careful of trying to hammer a nail with a saw
1657,2019-04-13T10:04:44.229800,Gia,Oh I see
1657,2019-04-13T10:05:01.230700,Erika,PowerBI is meant to be hooked up to a relational data soure
1657,2019-04-13T10:05:03.230900,Erika,*source
1657,2019-04-13T10:05:12.231600,Gia,"This is only giving me counties names, can I use some fips code to match to a state"
1657,2019-04-13T10:05:18.231900,Gia,Oh yea
1657,2019-04-13T10:05:25.232300,Gia,I noticed that I spent until 10 am last night
1657,2019-04-13T10:05:30.232600,Gia,Fighting with power bi 
1657,2019-04-13T10:05:30.232700,Erika,trying to build a pipeline from non-relational straight to powerbi will provide too much of a technical debt
1657,2019-04-13T10:05:31.232900,Gia,And json
1657,2019-04-13T10:05:49.233200,Erika,"and as soon as the json becomes nested, your pipeline fails"
1657,2019-04-13T10:05:59.233500,Gia,Yea if you saw this file it is nested
1657,2019-04-13T10:06:12.233800,Erika,ah yeah then you don't want that
1657,2019-04-13T10:06:22.234300,Erika,you need  an intermediary step to flatten
1657,2019-04-13T10:06:26.234600,Gia,Opening pycharm
1657,2019-04-13T10:06:40.235300,Gia,Can I have python create a csv file 
1657,2019-04-13T10:06:56.235800,Gia,Oh I forgot I got sql express on this laptop
1657,2019-04-13T10:07:02.236000,Erika,"if you don't  have a db at hand, then unflatten into dataframe and save as csv's with df.to_csv('file.csv')"
1657,2019-04-13T10:07:22.236300,Gia,Cool
1657,2019-04-13T10:07:28.236600,Erika,"but if you are planning to scale this, then you need a db"
1657,2019-04-13T10:07:30.236900,Gia,I am opening up pycharm
1657,2019-04-13T10:07:39.237300,Gia,Na this is one time project
1657,2019-04-13T10:07:41.237500,Erika,but if i were you i would try and avoid powerbi without a db
1657,2019-04-13T10:07:59.237900,Gia,Okay I will use sql express
1657,2019-04-13T10:08:41.238700,Erika,what is your main goal?
1657,2019-04-13T10:08:48.239100,Gia,My main goal is this
1657,2019-04-13T10:09:25.239600,Gia,And also a map
1657,2019-04-13T10:09:39.239800,Erika,no more high level please
1657,2019-04-13T10:09:47.240200,Erika,like you would explain to your grandmother
1657,2019-04-13T10:09:53.240700,Gia,Okay
1657,2019-04-13T10:09:54.240800,Erika,then we can go low level from there
1657,2019-04-13T10:10:25.241600,Gia,My end goal is to be able to be able to tell how many knicks fans are in X county
1657,2019-04-13T10:10:50.242000,Erika,who is your audiance?
1657,2019-04-13T10:10:53.242300,Erika,you or someone else?
1657,2019-04-13T10:10:59.242500,Gia,My manager
1657,2019-04-13T10:11:04.242800,Gia,It a proof of concept
1657,2019-04-13T10:11:10.243100,Gia,To show what powerbi can do
1657,2019-04-13T10:11:25.243500,Gia,While also probably solving a business thing
1657,2019-04-13T10:12:16.244700,Erika,apologies but I can only help if it is in a personal capacity
1657,2019-04-13T10:12:28.245200,Gia,Ahh yea sorry
1657,2019-04-13T10:12:36.245700,Gia,That fine I totally forgot the rules
1657,2019-04-13T10:12:36.245800,Erika,if it is for your work then we need to speak legalities
1657,2019-04-13T10:12:47.246100,Gia,Yea I can’t say much 
1657,2019-04-13T10:12:55.246600,Gia,But I will use pycharm to flat it
1657,2019-04-13T10:13:51.247200,Gia,Thanks for the tips
1657,2019-04-13T10:13:52.247300,Gia,Sorry
1657,2019-04-13T10:14:01.247700,Erika,it's okay :slightly_smiling_face:
1657,2019-04-13T10:14:04.248100,Erika,and pleasure for the tips

1657,2019-04-13T10:15:09.249600,Gia,Anyways I should go get my dry cleaning and breakfast and then come back home and just code
1657,2019-04-13T10:15:16.249900,Gia,Until I have a solution before monday
1657,2019-04-13T10:15:39.250200,Gia,Just one last quesiton none work realted
1657,2019-04-13T10:15:48.250600,Gia,Python support mssql right
1657,2019-04-13T10:17:24.251200,Erika,have you used sql server manager before?
1657,2019-04-13T10:17:40.251800,Erika,"where you would say ""select top 10 * from table with (nolock)"" ?"
1657,2019-04-13T10:17:50.252000,Gia,Yea I have
1657,2019-04-13T10:18:02.252300,Erika,okay now when you execute it in sql server manager
1657,2019-04-13T10:18:13.252700,Erika,you automatically login to the db
1657,2019-04-13T10:18:17.253000,Gia,Yea
1657,2019-04-13T10:18:21.253300,Erika,you parse a string to the server
1657,2019-04-13T10:18:29.253600,Erika,the server reads it and spits out the results
1657,2019-04-13T10:18:34.253900,Gia,Yea
1657,2019-04-13T10:18:48.254300,Erika,"now in the same way, you can connect to ANY sql server from python"
1657,2019-04-13T10:18:55.254600,Erika,and send a string to it
1657,2019-04-13T10:19:10.255000,Erika,the connection is called a *odbc* connection
1657,2019-04-13T10:19:17.255200,Erika,you will need pyodbc
1657,2019-04-13T10:19:52.256000,Erika,and look at Microsoft docs on how to set up a odbc connection between your python environment and the SQL server
1657,2019-04-13T10:20:25.256200,Gia,Ahh I see
1657,2019-04-13T10:24:02.256800,Gia,Thanks for the tip
1658,2019-04-13T09:53:23.217200,Gia,In power query
1659,2019-04-13T11:13:16.257300,Cherish,<#C5CAD2J67|editors> is probably your best bet
1659,2019-04-13T11:13:51.257600,Cammie,"Can someone help me out with a random coding problem? I swear this is easy and I'm just being stupid.

I have dates that are in this format:

`2013.500`

The portion to the left of the `.` is the year. This is good. The portion to the right of the `.` is the percentage into the year, by month. So for example this says we're `50`% through the year, so we'd figure out that that means month 6 of of 12, or June.

I need to write a method to convert that fractional value to the month,. where just the numerical representation of the month is great [1-12]."
1659,2019-04-13T11:16:18.257900,Cammie,"Came up with:

```
def month_decimal_to_index(s: str):
    """"""Converts the weird encoding deciaml that this data set had to an actual month.
    EX: '2013.250' -&gt; 3, for March, the third month of the year
    
    """"""
    DECIMAL_VALUE_PER_MONTH = 1.00/12
    return float('.' + s.split('.')[1])//DECIMAL_VALUE_PER_MONTH + 1 # we reattach the '.' we split on, as it is a decimal and we want to use it
```"
1659,2019-04-13T11:35:48.258500,Raven,In what way does your attempt not work?
1659,2019-04-13T11:38:10.259700,Sasha,"A handy trick is to use the modulus operator to get the fractional part of a float, so `(float(s) % 1) * 12` would give you the month."
1659,2019-04-13T11:40:58.261900,Raven,"A more accurate approach, depending on what exactly the fraction means, might be to work out if it's a leap year, to multiply that fractional part by 365 or 366 accordingly, add that number of days to a datetime object for Jan 1st of that year, then extract the month"
1660,2019-04-13T11:38:44.260300,Sasha,"However, the representation is a little weird. If 0.500 is supposed to be June, how is December specified?"
1660,2019-04-13T13:03:34.262500,Stan,"<@Bruna>
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = [('A1', u'Country'), ('B1', u'Invoice required for Ancillary Supply Import License?'), ('C1', u'Notification of shipment to be provided to (AS)')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; values = [d[1] for d in data]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(values)
[u'Country', u'Invoice required for Ancillary Supply Import License?', u'Notification of shipment to be provided to (AS)']
```

`[d[1] for d in data]` This is called a list-comprehension. Look it up. `d` in `data` refers to  a tuple like `('A1', u'Country')`. Within `d`, `d[0]` would be `A1` and `d[1]` would be `Country`.

The whole logic enclosed in `[..]` is building a new list with results (hence ""comprehension"")."

1662,2019-04-13T15:27:47.268000,Carmen,"Abusing terminology a little bit, a shallow copy is effectively just a new pointer to an existing object. You'd want one of these when you want to modify something in-place (or you just want read-only access to it, no modifications needed). You want a deep copy of something when you need to modify the new copy, but retain the old copy as it was at the time of the copy (or do something else to modify it that won't affect the new copy)."
1662,2019-04-13T15:28:37.268700,Carmen,"Shallow copies are great for when you've got a gigantic object in memory, and you don't want to make copies of it for no good reason."
1662,2019-04-13T15:29:03.269400,Carmen,"Deep copies are good for when you want to keep concurrent, independent copies of an object that can be modified at-will without affecting each other."

1662,2019-04-13T17:05:59.272200,Carmen,The raw build won't include those modules. You have to add them yourself afterwards.
1662,2019-04-13T17:06:11.272500,Carmen,`Third-party packages should be installed by the application installer alongside the embedded distribution.`
1662,2019-04-13T17:07:31.273800,Carmen,"Basically, that boils down to ""drop the module files in the standard library directory"", either during final install or between your build step and your installer finalization step."

but also, with that, I was wondering if this is also possible to do on a Mac? I noticed that Python has embedded distributions that are downloadable as a zip, and contain an exe, but I'm surprised they don't just have it ready to go for a Mac as well, unless I'm missing something?"
1662,2019-04-13T17:26:45.277700,Carmen,"That's because Mac is Linux-based, so AFAIK typically they have a system Python included already."
1662,2019-04-13T17:27:03.277900,Carmen,For values of linux-based anyway.

1662,2019-04-13T17:30:49.280600,Hiroko,<@Hai> have you looked in the groovy docs?
1662,2019-04-13T17:31:06.281200,Monica,"&gt; That's because Mac is Linux-based, so AFAIK typically they have a system Python included already.

So that means that I should be able to use something like `pip` just by using a mac right?"
1662,2019-04-13T17:31:08.281400,Hiroko,"also, not sure you’ll get any response here because its a fairly niche JVM language, and this is a python community"
1662,2019-04-13T17:31:53.281800,Hiroko,<@Monica> might help if you describe exactly what you’re trying to do
1662,2019-04-13T17:32:17.282800,Hiroko,"right now, I have little idea of what you’re trying to do, or how its supposed to work?"

1662,2019-04-13T17:33:17.284600,Hiroko,that’s probably because the string is not valid json at all
1662,2019-04-13T17:33:20.284700,Hiroko,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1662,2019-04-13T17:34:00.285800,Hai,am getting values from a valid json and then again am trying to convert that values to a valid json
1662,2019-04-13T17:34:02.286000,Hai,yes
1662,2019-04-13T17:34:23.286500,Monica,"<@Hiroko> yeah. I am building an electron desktop app and part of it relies on Python, so I want to have a way to package python 3.6 with Numpy + other things installed when the app itself is installed"
1662,2019-04-13T17:34:56.287100,Hiroko,js + electron + python + numpy?
1662,2019-04-13T17:35:08.287800,Hiroko,that sounds like an unholy mess to get going

It's hell. I'm thinking about switching back to Java just to save myself"
1662,2019-04-13T17:36:03.290000,Monica,haven't done Java in over 4 years
1662,2019-04-13T17:36:35.290900,Carmen,"<@Monica> If you download the embedded python zipfile from <http://Python.org|Python.org>, you can unzip it to see what's inside. In there will be another zipfile called `python36.zip`. That's your libraries folder. You'll need to copy the relevant files from your 3rd party modules into that zipfile."
1662,2019-04-13T17:36:36.291000,Hiroko,"if its a desktop app, why not use one of the python gui frameworks?"
1662,2019-04-13T17:37:00.292000,Monica,I like node :disappointed:
1662,2019-04-13T17:37:09.292500,Hiroko,sounds like you’ll have similar issues if you go to java/swing/etc
1662,2019-04-13T17:37:20.293100,Carmen,"Python has a module to manipulate zipfiles, so you should be able to write a script to do it automatically."
1662,2019-04-13T17:37:26.293300,Hiroko,use the right tool for the job :wink:
1662,2019-04-13T17:38:22.294900,Hiroko,node is ok.  electron is a steaming pile of a mess
1662,2019-04-13T17:38:23.295000,Monica,"<@Carmen> yeah, I'm looking at that. It contains a lot of `.pyc` files. Not entirely sure how this relates to the modules"
1662,2019-04-13T17:38:42.295600,Carmen,`.pyc` files are just python scripts that have been compiled.
1662,2019-04-13T17:38:48.296000,Hiroko,pyc == compiled python bytecode
1662,2019-04-13T17:38:50.296200,Monica,right
1662,2019-04-13T17:38:53.296300,Carmen,"They're bytecode, and they're what the Python interpreter actually executes."
1662,2019-04-13T17:40:11.297900,Monica,"so I need to compile a module to bytecode and put it in the `python36` folder is all, correct?"
1662,2019-04-13T17:40:58.298500,Monica,<@Hiroko> do you know if the python GUI frameworks allow for good cross-platform development?
1662,2019-04-13T17:41:12.298800,Hiroko,take a look at Calibre
1662,2019-04-13T17:41:31.299300,Hiroko,its a pretty good desktop application for managing ebooks on a computer
1662,2019-04-13T17:41:42.299500,Hiroko,that’s all written in python

1662,2019-04-13T17:43:13.300100,Monica,I used that when I wrote my novels!
1662,2019-04-13T17:43:17.300300,Monica,didn't know that!
1662,2019-04-13T17:44:33.302000,Carmen,"Realistically, I'd assume the modules should mostly already be pre-compiled. If not, yeah, you'll want to compile them down to bytecode."
1662,2019-04-13T17:44:35.302200,Monica,the reason I was using electron is because I already get it. And it's easy to upgrade the UX of the app. I don't have that kind of faith in the many python GUI frameworkds
1662,2019-04-13T17:44:45.302500,Carmen,You probably have a specific module folder structure that you'll need to preserve as well.
1662,2019-04-13T17:45:08.302800,Monica,"&gt; You probably have a specific module folder structure that you'll need to preserve as well.
right, and that's why I am asking all these questiosn"
1662,2019-04-13T17:45:46.303400,Carmen,"You'll want to review the Python documentation for module development, then. That'll give you the background you need for preserving module structure."
1662,2019-04-13T17:48:53.303700,Monica,Ok thanks!
1662,2019-04-13T17:55:23.304800,Monica,Would you guys happen to know which python GUI framework allows for the better-looking and more user-friendly building?
1662,2019-04-13T18:06:30.305700,Sasha,It's a mix of hex escape characters plus some regular ASCII ones.

1666,2019-04-13T18:09:32.307900,Sasha,"No, the `\xNN` pattern has only two hex digits in it. So it's parsed as `\x1b ""d001"" \x02 \x1b ""h00""`, etc."

&gt; Third-party packages should be installed by the application installer alongside the embedded distribution. Using pip to manage dependencies as for a regular Python installation is not supported with this distribution,

okay, so that is effectively saying, 3rd-party packages should be installed without using `pip`.  Then, regarding Embedding Python, which is what I am doing, it says:

&gt; packages can be installed to any location as there is an opportunity to specify search paths before initializing the interpreter. Otherwise, there is no fundamental differences between using the embedded distribution and a regular installation."
1667,2019-04-13T19:46:00.318400,Monica,"oh and it also says ...

1677,2019-04-14T10:10:10.335200,Frankie,I think it's just bad the way I've designed it so I'm trying to rearrange things a bit
1677,2019-04-14T10:12:49.337800,Frankie,"basically the problem is I have an API which I built as a project app, which supplies all the data for my site and it uses DRF. However, I also have a blog app, which uses wagtail, which also uses DRF. So I had to do some custom permissions magic cause Wagtail was trying to send its API requests through my personal API's custom permissions classes, and now I've got a permissions module in my API app which I need in my `settings.py`, but the permissions module requires some things out of `settings.py` to determine the permissions. Lol"
1677,2019-04-14T10:26:27.347500,Frankie,"Here is some relevant info if it helps.

My API's *custom_permissions.py:*

Snippet of my API's *views.py*:
```
from rest_framework.viewsets import ViewSet
from rest_framework.decorators import action
from django.conf import settings

# Get default perms from settings, so I can change it in only one place if needed, or add more perms
LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS = settings.LFA_API_SETTINGS['DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES']

    permission_classes = LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS

    def some_other_different_action(self, request, format=None):
        # Do other different stuff

# ... lots more ViewSets and APIViews
```

The actual issue is that when I launch it into my staging environment on AWS (elastic beanstalk) the `SECRET_KEY` is coming back as empty, I think because the circular dependency is causing it to fail loading the settings. In staging, I use a staging.py settings file which basically is just `from base import *` and adds a few other variables for AWS and my live database and stuff."
1677,2019-04-14T10:49:34.350000,Frankie,"So it turns out if I remove the `IsPremium` import from base.py and the one setting that uses it, and instead import `IsPremium` directly into custom_permissions.py, the app deploys normally but fails data migrations. That's a different problem, but I'm still wondering if anyone can see a way to be able to control the default permissions class in settings.py instead of having to do it in the API views like this:

```
from .permissions.custom_permissions import IsPremium
LFA_DEFAULT_PERMS = (IsPremium,)
```

It would just be nice to have a single place to manage everything where the settings for DRF already live. :man-shrugging:"

1678,2019-04-14T13:08:39.357500,Hai,yaa its my mistake i was just curious if someone know's groovy
1678,2019-04-14T13:09:00.357900,Frankie,no worries. I thought this was strictly for python help but I guess I could be wrong.
1678,2019-04-14T13:09:09.358100,Hai,okay
1678,2019-04-14T13:09:37.358500,Frankie,Maybe try this discord channel? <https://discordapp.com/channels/181866934353133570/181871712151928834> it seems like it's for general programming.

1679,2019-04-14T17:21:54.363100,Reanna,"Hi guys. Anyone familiar with django internationalization? I'm getting some weird behavior in my views.py:
```
from django.utils import translation
print(request.session[translation.LANGUAGE_SESSION_KEY])  # Outputs the proper active language
print(translation.get_language())  # Always outputs the default language defined in settings.py
```
also translation.activate() doesn't persist across requests. And translation.gettext() always uses the default language. Any ideas?"
1679,2019-04-14T17:22:53.363700,Reanna,I'm using the built-in i18n set_language route to toggle languages.
1679,2019-04-14T17:25:04.364300,Hiroko,"just checking, but are you following the location rules for setting the middleware?"
1679,2019-04-14T17:25:11.364500,Hiroko,<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/i18n/translation/#how-django-discovers-language-preference>
1679,2019-04-14T17:27:26.365900,Reanna,"Yes, the middleware is included and in the correct location. Url language prefixes are functional so the middleware must be working.."
1679,2019-04-14T17:27:41.366300,Hiroko,gotcha
1679,2019-04-14T17:27:54.366700,Hiroko,having `activate` not persist across requests is probably standard behavior
1679,2019-04-14T17:28:08.366900,Hiroko,<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/i18n/translation/#explicitly-setting-the-active-language>
1679,2019-04-14T17:28:16.367100,Hiroko,"&gt;&gt;&gt;You’ve already been introduced to django.utils.translation.activate(). That applies to the current thread only. To persist the language for the entire session, also modify LANGUAGE_SESSION_KEY in the session:"
1679,2019-04-14T17:28:35.367300,Hiroko,"&gt;&gt;&gt;You would typically want to use both: django.utils.translation.activate() will change the language for this thread, and modifying the session makes this preference persist in future requests."
1679,2019-04-14T17:29:52.368500,Reanna,"I see. So now this is quite strange... the session has the corrent language set, but gettext() always uses the default language - this is the bug I'm originally trying to solve."
1679,2019-04-14T17:30:33.369200,Reanna,And translation.get_language() is also not correct... I wonder how where it get's the language from if not from the request object
1679,2019-04-14T17:31:10.369600,Hiroko,have you tried using with lazy?

```    # If we don't have a real translation object, assume it's the default language.

1679,2019-04-14T17:47:06.373200,Hiroko,that’s a pretty old version
1679,2019-04-14T17:47:35.373600,Reanna,I started the project a while ago...
1679,2019-04-14T17:47:36.373700,Hiroko,can you update?
1679,2019-04-14T17:47:49.374200,Reanna,Sure
1679,2019-04-14T17:47:52.374400,Hiroko,"there’s been lots of changes since, so it might be that this is fixed"
1679,2019-04-14T17:48:03.374700,Hiroko,current version is 2.2 LTS
1679,2019-04-14T17:48:33.375100,Reanna,"Ok, installing v2.2"
1679,2019-04-14T17:48:43.375400,Hiroko,there’s been 23 releases of django across versions since 2.0.1
1679,2019-04-14T17:49:19.375700,Reanna,gotta update mysqlclient too :smile:
1679,2019-04-14T17:50:37.376100,Reanna,unfortunately there's the same behaviour
1679,2019-04-14T17:55:37.376900,Reanna,for what it's work... translations in the templates work fine too. I guess that's using the request session language..

1679,2019-04-14T18:04:28.377800,Hiroko,"my guess is for whatever reason, `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE` is always used in your case."
1679,2019-04-14T18:06:46.379700,Reanna,"Yes.. i guess the i18n set_language route isn't setting the language correctly. But then again, according to the django docs, updating the session should persist the language change (which isn't happening) but for whatever reason util.translation get's it's translation object from somewhere else.."
1680,2019-04-14T18:45:10.379900,Monica,ok brand new question
1680,2019-04-14T18:45:18.380200,Monica,i was thinking this yesterday
1680,2019-04-14T18:45:45.380700,Monica,for embedded distributions of python ... why can't I use pip to install third party packages?
1680,2019-04-14T18:55:58.381400,Monica,"I am assuming that it's because of this warning by <http://Pypa.io|Pypa.io> ?

```Create a programme that uses any text file with random content as an input, and checks all the words contained in such text file for letter combinations consisting of more than 3 letters.
Programme output will consist in up to 10 most common letter combinations and their difference in percentage displayed as a table and a bar chart.

1684,2019-04-15T07:35:44.403700,Leida,"Sample solution:```
The content of the input file:
hall feels heels

Frequencies:

feels: 14.29%
heels: 14.29%

1684,2019-04-15T07:35:59.403900,Leida,"My solution:```
1. Character stream -&gt; 2. word detector and input buffer -&gt; 3. combinations finder -&gt; 4. storage. -&gt; End of file -&gt; 5. sorting -&gt; 6. table/graph output.

1. Character stream.
Reads the file one character at a time.

2. Word detector and input buffer.
Has internal memory for several characters. When an invalid character is received the buffer is reset to empty. When there are 4 or more characters in the buffer, the contents of the buffer are emited to the next function in the pipeline. Even after emitting, the contents are kept. Only invalid characters reset the buffer.

3. Combinations finder.
The received word is the first combination. It gets emitted into the following function. Remove the first character in the word. If the length is atleast 4 emit that too. Keep removing the first letter and emitting until there are less than 4 characters. 

4. Storage.
Stores the combination and the occurance count. If the combination exists add 1 to the counter. If it doesnt exist set it to 1. After adding each occurance add 1 to total counter.

End of file reached.

5. Sorting.
Read through the stored data and keep track of the 10 most used combinations.

6. Print table and diagram.
Table - each row is the combination + the occurance percentage. Percentage is the number of occurances/total combinations * 100%.
Diagram can be an ascii of |-------. Percentage * “-” as the bar.
Both need some formating to look nice.

1685,2019-04-15T08:29:24.409400,Renay,"probably better for performance, but i think PEP8 prefers if all imports are at the top of the file. I might be wrong though

<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports>"
1685,2019-04-15T08:29:30.409700,Leida,so `split()` should be replaced by some `tokenize()`
1685,2019-04-15T08:37:36.410800,Leida,umm i think i have seen it used in the wild but in general if you have a function in a file that needs some imports but its never used then why have the function?
1685,2019-04-15T08:39:02.412200,Leida,what happens when you try to import again?
1685,2019-04-15T08:39:16.412500,Leida,wouldnt that incur some overhead?
1685,2019-04-15T08:39:33.412900,Jimmy,import are cached so not really
1685,2019-04-15T08:39:51.413400,Jimmy,but I think it's considered good practice to have all imports at the same place (the top)
1685,2019-04-15T08:40:36.414100,Jimmy,I could see an use case if importing a module takes a lot of time otherwise meh
1685,2019-04-15T08:40:46.414400,Conchita,The functions are there because they are sometime used
1685,2019-04-15T08:40:56.414900,Jimmy,because you'll need to duplicate import for each function to be sure it's imported there
1685,2019-04-15T08:41:03.415300,Jimmy,so more work for almost no gain
1685,2019-04-15T08:41:36.416100,Conchita,Yes someone linked me the pep-8 guide where it states you should have all imports in the first lines
1685,2019-04-15T08:41:48.416200,Conchita,Yep it does say that! Thanks!
1685,2019-04-15T08:54:20.416900,Hiroko,the only case I can see using imports locally in a function is if you’re doing something with async tasks that don’t get called frequently
1685,2019-04-15T08:55:06.417400,Hiroko,I would also say that its a negative for readability and knowing what stuff is being used
1685,2019-04-15T08:55:49.418200,Hiroko,"for example, you have a file with lots of functions in it that are dedicated to a thing.  If you continually import locally, you get lots of duplicated imports"
1685,2019-04-15T08:57:06.419200,Jonas,The other case is if you have circular imports
1685,2019-04-15T08:57:36.420100,Jonas,"which happens in some specific cases that are hard to avoid. But in general, no, please don't do that kind of import :smile: Add them to the top."
1685,2019-04-15T08:58:56.421000,Renay,if you have circular imports you ought to look at refactoring your code. There are ways around it
1685,2019-04-15T08:59:02.421100,Jonas,I think you want <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product> for tha
1685,2019-04-15T08:59:13.421900,Jonas,not always unfortunately :disappointed:
1685,2019-04-15T08:59:33.422500,Jonas,and in some cases refactoring the code is worse
1685,2019-04-15T08:59:44.422800,Jonas,you end up splitting your code out in illogical places just to avoid it
1685,2019-04-15T09:01:06.423000,Jonas,but in general your approach is sound <@Leida>. Try and code it and we can give more feedback
1685,2019-04-15T09:03:28.423200,Leida,thank you for taking a look!
1686,2019-04-15T10:03:47.431800,Hildegard,"Meh. In C-like languages, declaring all variables at the top of the scope used to be required, then it held on as a style guide rule, and then finally fell out of favor a long time ago. Because declaring names close to the point of use is useful. Python imports are a similar mechanism, so the PEP8 rule always seemed wrong as a hard rule. Prefer the top, but don't insist on it."
1686,2019-04-15T10:13:47.438300,Hildegard,"Sure, so the widely used ones go at the top. In general, doing a good job at organizing will probably lead to that. But maybe in a less critical script I'm defining a CLI at the bottom and that's where I want argparse and sys if that's the only place I need it"
1686,2019-04-15T10:27:52.441300,Hildegard,"Sure, but I'm arguing that the reasons that familiar idiom is useful don't vanish in literally all other cases"
1686,2019-04-15T10:29:12.444700,Jonas,"Interesting brain teaser from our CEO today:
&gt; Write down the equation:
&gt; 65 – 43 = 21.
&gt; You’ll notice that this is not correct. 65 minus 43 equals 22, not 21. The object is to move exactly two of the digits to create a correct equation. There is no trick in the puzzle’s wording. In the answer, the minus and equal signs do not move.

I had a go using itertools to enumerate all possible swaps, and no equation is correct. But then I realised you can move digits rather than swap them: ie. `654 + 3 = 21`"

1686,2019-04-15T10:38:47.449700,Carlo,I was going on about some solution using all permutations then moving operands around but kinda forgot about the two movements thing lol
1686,2019-04-15T10:39:43.450100,Jettie,options?
1686,2019-04-15T10:40:15.450800,Jettie,"kwargs is a convention when you declare a function, but apart from that if you create a dict to later unpack into another function call you're free to use any name"
1686,2019-04-15T10:41:19.450900,Jimmy,it reminds me when <@Genesis> used to ask some trick question :stuck_out_tongue:
1686,2019-04-15T10:41:52.451100,Jonas,"If it was one we could just do something super hacky: `[eval(x) for x in itertools.permutations(['6', '5', '-', '4', '3', '==', '2', '1'])]`"

1686,2019-04-15T10:42:11.451500,Jonas,"obviously catching any invalid syntax errors, but it would enumerate all possible movements."
1686,2019-04-15T10:42:32.451700,Jonas,"but yeah, accounting for exactly two moves? I'm really not sure how to do that"
1686,2019-04-15T10:44:29.451900,Hildegard,"To handle shifts, maybe start by getting a list of each digit. And then do some slicing. Not sure that will pan out"
1686,2019-04-15T10:44:42.452100,Genesis,This is fun. I'll write you up an answer in 30ish minutes
1686,2019-04-15T10:46:03.453800,Hildegard,"Fwiw, matplotlob uses `subplot_kws`, `scatter_kws`."

1687,2019-04-15T10:06:19.432900,Hiroko,"problem I see with that is when you’re declaring at points of multiple usage, the scope of the import doesn’t bubble up"
1687,2019-04-15T10:06:38.433300,Hiroko,so you end up having to import the same thing multiple times
1687,2019-04-15T10:06:47.433700,Hiroko,and whats the “point of usage”?
1687,2019-04-15T10:07:21.434300,Hiroko,"that can work the first time around for a simple thing, but I can see that being a pain in the butt for a larger project"
1687,2019-04-15T10:18:49.439300,Hildegard,Extreme point of usage example `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`
1687,2019-04-15T10:24:53.439600,Hiroko,"I use that alot, FWIW"
1687,2019-04-15T10:25:00.439900,Hiroko,but it never makes it to a code commit
1688,2019-04-15T11:06:38.455500,Carlo,"&gt; There is no trick in the puzzle’s wording
<@Jonas> if that's the case I have a feeling this doesn't mean ""there is no trick at all"""
1688,2019-04-15T11:07:02.455800,Clemmie,what python version?
1688,2019-04-15T11:07:40.456000,Nenita,3
1688,2019-04-15T11:08:01.456700,Nenita,"it did say that in 2 you can use .keys()[index], but was hoping there was some method in 3"
1688,2019-04-15T11:08:40.458100,Cherish,"I think in 3 they changed `.keys()` to return a `dict_keys` object instead of a standard list, which might be causing that issue"
1688,2019-04-15T11:08:48.458300,Clemmie,"yeah, in python 3 `keys()` is a view object - you want to do `list(d.keys())[0]`"
1688,2019-04-15T11:08:50.458500,Cherish,"```python -c ""d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}; print(type(d.keys()))""
&lt;class 'dict_keys'&gt;```"
1688,2019-04-15T11:10:03.459400,Nenita,"alright, perfectly solved my problem. Thank you. List seems to be a very power function (if its a function :confused:, i read that len() isn't considered a function)."
1688,2019-04-15T11:11:44.459800,Clemmie,list isn’t a function - when you call that around an iterable you are `cast` ing
1688,2019-04-15T11:13:10.459900,Genesis,<@Jonas>  doesnt look like you considered changing the answer as well
1688,2019-04-15T11:14:22.460100,Jonas,"I think I did? that's `c_group`. In any case, the apparent solution was `65 - 4^3 = 1^2` :joy:"

1688,2019-04-15T11:21:12.460800,Jimmy,a bit tricky
1689,2019-04-15T11:31:18.463300,Nicholle,"I may be opening a can of worms with this question, but I'm a little confused on which tool I should use to handle python environments and packages. In my research I'm coming across things like `virtualenv`, `pipenv`, `poetry`, `conda`/`anaconda`. What's _good_, or what is considered _best practice_?"
1689,2019-04-15T11:47:07.463800,Lance,"I personally use Pyenv and virtualenvwrapper. The first is to “install” any python version you want either globally or locally and the second is to create environments, super convenient… check out this gist <https://gist.github.com/SebastiaAgramunt/5185ccf8637e69f611bd1217a98289b2>"
1689,2019-04-15T11:48:34.464000,Lance,if you start now with python and data science anaconda is perhaps the  easiest approach. Let me know if it helps or need me to explain something
1689,2019-04-15T11:58:41.464400,Nicholle,"Thanks, that makes sense. I think my problem is that I'm coming from languages with a _de-facto_ package management system (`npm`, `cargo`, `stack`, etc), and I'm finding that python doesn't have a _standard_ per se, and there are benefits and disadvantages to each approach."
1689,2019-04-15T12:04:42.464600,Lance,"Well, in Python the package manager is pip. If you look at a typical python project there’s always a requirements.txt (you do ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install those in your environment) with all the packages you need and in the docu the python version the developer has used. I don’t know a lot of software development though…"
1689,2019-04-15T12:06:23.464900,Lance,here’s the way to package your software <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/>
1689,2019-04-15T12:24:58.465200,Carmen,"Part of your confusion about a standard is that Python has been around for longer than most of those other languages, so they got to benefit from starting out with a single officially-approved package management system. They knew it was needed, and included it from the start. Python didn't have that benefit, so it has a bunch of different options available."
1690,2019-04-15T12:25:18.465400,Carmen,"*from where people rolled their own solutions, and so did everyone else."
1690,2019-04-15T12:37:08.465700,Carlo,a bit disingenuous honestly
1690,2019-04-15T12:38:03.465900,Carlo,"""There is no trick in the puzzle’s wording"" but ""moving"" didn't mean what was implied :stuck_out_tongue:"
1690,2019-04-15T12:39:29.467700,Nenita,"ok, i just ran into a huge pickle. I have a single dictionary that is assigned across a multitude of dates. Therefore, each date has its own dictionary. The problem is when I update a value in any of the dictionaries, every date's dictionary updates with the same value. In other words, its acting as a single dictionary rather than each date having its own independant dictionary. How can i get around this?]"
1690,2019-04-15T12:40:32.468700,Nenita,I need to assign each date it's own dictionary but how can i do that with a for loop and keep it from using the same dictionary? I just need it to copy the dictionary structure and keep it independant to its' date.
1690,2019-04-15T12:41:29.469100,Carmen,We need to see some code to figure out exactly what's going wrong.
1690,2019-04-15T12:41:55.469900,Carmen,"My first guess without seeing anything is that you're probably declaring a single dictionary to start, and then assigning that dictionary reference to multiple variables."
1690,2019-04-15T12:41:58.470100,Carlo,"<@Nenita> you'll have to make a copy of the dictionary for each date, not assign the same dict"
1690,2019-04-15T12:42:42.470600,Nenita,None
1690,2019-04-15T12:42:52.471200,Carmen,`copy.deepcopy` is your friend. <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/copy.html>
1690,2019-04-15T12:42:55.471400,Carlo,`copy.deepcopy(dict)`

1690,2019-04-15T12:43:13.472300,Carlo,<@Carmen> damn you're just tiny bit quicker than I am haha
1690,2019-04-15T12:43:26.472500,Carlo,<@Nenita> youll have to import `copy`
1690,2019-04-15T12:43:38.472700,Nenita,so it'd be?
1690,2019-04-15T12:43:43.473100,Carmen,Correct.
1690,2019-04-15T12:43:52.473300,Nenita,that god that solution was easy
1690,2019-04-15T12:44:20.473400,Nenita,will i need copy for this structure as well?
1690,2019-04-15T12:55:39.473800,Carmen,No.
1690,2019-04-15T12:55:57.474200,Carmen,"Because you're creating the dict inside the loop, it's creating and assigning a new object each iteration"
1690,2019-04-15T12:59:37.475200,Nenita,"alright thank. i feel stupid, but what would be the most accurate way of getting the average of averages. this link proves that getting the average of averages will have differing results. <https://lemire.me/blog/2005/10/28/average-of-averages-is-not-the-average/>"
1690,2019-04-15T13:00:02.475900,Nenita,"i figure (avg1 + avg2) / 2, but supposedly that gives different results"
1690,2019-04-15T13:04:07.476400,Nenita,i guess disregard that. doing the math myself gives close enough results.
1690,2019-04-15T13:08:59.477000,Jettie,"you can trivially fix this, if you know the sizes of every subset"

&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(big) / len(big)
4.5

4.5  # right

1690,2019-04-15T13:11:02.477700,Jettie,i.e. you need to assign weights to your sub-averages

1694,2019-04-15T16:31:48.483600,Hiroko,I would say that’s highly dependent on the specs for the meter
1694,2019-04-15T16:32:08.484100,Hiroko,"eg, is there a good overall specification, or does each model have its own variants?"
1694,2019-04-15T16:37:06.486000,Sasha,"Yeah, I'd suspect that every brand has its own protocol language, unfortunately."
1694,2019-04-15T16:37:38.486600,Cherish,"each model of multimeter could have its own specs on how it's sending data through the RS-232 connection, there might be some similarities between them, but I'd guess you'd need something written for each individual meter"

1696,2019-04-15T19:12:07.493100,Sasha,"I mean, it's a little weird that you're reusing the function name as a variable, but that shouldn't actually cause it to run twice. How are you calling it?"
1696,2019-04-15T19:28:42.493300,Priscilla,the `ser_num_check()` is to check if the serial number is valid
1696,2019-04-15T19:28:59.493800,Priscilla,"and ill change the variable name, thanks!"
1696,2019-04-15T19:39:32.495800,Sasha,"On an unrelated note, `if` and `elif` are not functions, so PEP 8 style suggests `if a == b:` rather than `if(a == b):`."
1696,2019-04-15T19:42:36.496800,Priscilla,ser_num_check() is not calling ser_num() that was my first thought too
1696,2019-04-15T19:43:27.498100,Priscilla,edKeyes really? thats how I used to write it! i started using () because my dumb professor told me too... rat bastard

1696,2019-04-15T19:44:20.499000,Priscilla,"not the last wrong thing i was taught, im sure"
1696,2019-04-15T19:45:38.499500,Sasha,"At this point I'd just do a ""find"" command for ""ser_num()"" and see where it's being called from."
1696,2019-04-15T19:47:18.001000,Sasha,There is also the possibility that you have something strange going on with function references and have accidentally done a statement like `ser_num_check = ser_num` such that you've reassigned another function to also be `ser_num`.

I expect something like

1701,2019-04-16T02:34:11.017500,Monet,Understood . These columns names are of data frame .. I have to specify sheet columns in some other field ..not sure if can easily be done

1705,2019-04-16T10:57:35.031600,Johna,you could do something really basic or you could go nuts and try something like this <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01496.pdf>

1705,2019-04-16T11:02:54.033300,Clemmie,<@Alysia> I would search out the specifications themselves (or even the wikipedia pages) those generally have an example of the algorithm written and explained (jpeg for example <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG>)

My front end skills are pretty rusty so I am looking for something I can just drop in to allow my users to edit this data in a web UI, maybe a grid too, or like a forms wizard or something…  I was looking at the django packages and there are soooo many. Does anyone have any suggestions on one they have used and liked so I can have a place to start?"
1706,2019-04-16T11:42:35.039700,Eliana,if that really exists that sounds crazy awesome. you could use django’s admin interface to do something like that i imagine.
1706,2019-04-16T11:43:26.040400,Eliana,i haven’t heard of a drop in type of thing. sounds difficult as each cell would need to do some backend (ajax) request.
1706,2019-04-16T11:56:25.041500,Kit,ok :disappointed:  Some of it would be doable in django  admin but some of it would be much faster in a grid mode and I may have a hard time getting these people away from there excel sheets… lol

1708,2019-04-16T18:40:25.054100,Pasquale,Start by trying to solve some real world problems.  Automate some tasks on your computer.    As for how long it takes - that is very much dependent on the individual.  Since you have no programming experience it will take longer than someone who knows other languages.   A good way to get practical experience is to help answer questions on Stack Overflow or <http://Codementor.io|Codementor.io>.  That experience will make you dig deep and provide some pre-job experience.

1709,2019-04-16T21:10:24.072000,Eliana,"<@Isabel> It depends on a number of things which makes it really hard to pin down a number of years. I taught myself python when i was already working as a database administrator. I used python on the job off and on for ~3 years and then moved to a developer role. This hints at what <@Pasquale> was saying about solving real world problems. This can be difficult for someone who may not have real world business problems to get the “trigger time”. These problems are also unique to particular areas like web development, networking, databases, analytics, data science, etc. This is when the beauty of open-source comes into play. If I had to start all over and go from “zero to hero” this would be my plan of attack.

1. Understand that software development is a craft like any other. The old saying goes, “It’s the journey not the destination”. It builds from basic concepts to more advanced ones and requires time and dedication.
2. Become really good at the basics. Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, if/then, for/while loops .etc. Figure out different ways to use these. They will be the things that drag you down later on if you don’t have a good understanding of them.
3. Find a community like this one to ask questions and talk with real programmers. Lose the ego. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and be curious. Feel the need to tinker and break things. Failure == learning. Be relentless in your pursuit to learning.
4. Read source code as much as you can. Find the really good projects and study the code line by line. Take it apart, reverse engineer, and learn the inner workings.
5. Find an open source project to contribute to. We have community projects here btw. This gives you experience with working with version control in a collaborative manner. You also have something to point to in a resume. Being a developer is SO much more than just producing code. There is testing, communication, collaboration, reading other’s code, etc.
6. Rinse and repeat."

1721,2019-04-17T10:48:49.123100,Clemmie,"<@Ambrose> I haven’t used VS, but I’m pretty sure you want to run `manage` in a command prompt. The docs about that are here <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs> . you can also ask for more help in <#C5CAD2J67|editors> - it looks like people talk about VS in there some"
1721,2019-04-17T10:53:03.123400,Ambrose,"<@Clemmie> great, i will try here too thanks! :slightly_smiling_face:"
1721,2019-04-17T11:03:54.126200,Eliana,ah i see. back when i used Django there was a `manage.py` file in the project directory. From what I remember that was in the root.  if you open a terminal to that directory with the proper virtualenv activated you could run commands like `python manage.py startapp my_app`
1721,2019-04-17T11:05:30.127400,Clemmie,that is all correct. I think the current issue is a question of an active virtual environment
1721,2019-04-17T11:05:43.127700,Ambrose,"<@Eliana> yup, but that's this part i missing! the venv is open, everything works good, but unable to find the good console to execute the command line"
1721,2019-04-17T11:07:54.130100,Clemmie,the console may start without a venv active. You (might) have 2 options - the first is the activate the venv in the console in the standard cli way for your tooling. The other is there might be a way to trigger the virtual environment when a console starts. The specifics are probably somewhere in VS docs or tutorials
1721,2019-04-17T11:09:34.131800,Clemmie,"also, some ides have the ability to run a script (say manage.py) but to prompt you for inputs prior to actually running. So you would click, say “run-&gt;manage” and it would open an input box for you to type “loaddata …“. Again, you would have to configure it to do that, if it is available. to the docs again!"
1721,2019-04-17T11:10:54.132800,Ambrose,"<@Clemmie> thanks i will take a look on that.. i hope to finally resolve the problem, that's the point i have using VS.. i prefer VSCode or oldschool vim! :slightly_smiling_face:"
1721,2019-04-17T11:25:32.133600,Eliana,it’s interesting that we’re discussing virtualenvs right now as I write some documentation on virtualenvs for one of our projects.
1721,2019-04-17T11:28:05.135700,Eliana,Are you tied to Visual Studio 2019? Another option is PyCharm which is a really good Python IDE. You could potentially be working with 2 editors jumping from C#/VB.Net but if it’s solely for Python that might be a good option. A downside is Pycharm is not free.
1721,2019-04-17T11:36:02.140200,Ambrose,"yes, i have PyCharm. It's working really good on it. But like VS2019 it's just come out, i would try to get the same thing on it. VS2019. If i can't, that not useful to use it for django project."

1725,2019-04-17T15:50:32.158700,Gemma,"<@Avis>, you can do that with standard library string methods or using the `re` module."
1725,2019-04-17T15:51:19.160500,Patrica,"<@Avis> I think understand what you’re saying. A simple solution would be to split the string on the hyphen and take the second element of that result.
```
s = 'logs-2019.01.10'
d = s.split('-')[1]
```
A more robust solution would be to use a regular expression"
1725,2019-04-17T15:52:11.161100,Monika,regular expressions are heavy
1725,2019-04-17T15:52:39.162100,Avis,yes that's idea but then i would have the time datetime module read the element the make a decision  based on the results
1725,2019-04-17T15:55:05.164800,Patrica,<@Monika> heavy?
1725,2019-04-17T15:55:06.164900,Gemma,"I think you have all that you need. I would organize your steps, write and test them!"
1725,2019-04-17T15:56:35.165500,Avis,<@Gemma> Thanks again I'll give it another go
1725,2019-04-17T16:01:18.166400,Monika,"just add `datetime.strptime(d, '%Y.%m.%d').date()` to the <@Patrica> solution"
1725,2019-04-17T16:03:51.168900,Monika,<@Patrica> Depends of the use case regular expressions may be not the right choice

1726,2019-04-17T16:05:41.171500,Patrica,"<@Granville> Have you looked into `asyncio` and the use of the `yield` keyword? Without knowing more about your specific situation it’s hard to say what the right solution would look like. Potentially, <#C7PFU2B2Q|rxpy> might have some good insights."
1726,2019-04-17T16:07:50.173300,Granville,"mmm, not yet. I'm stuck on trying to parse a streaming file or essentially either getting the next four lines from a matched line or finding all the lines in the stream file matching a keyword"
1726,2019-04-17T16:58:43.179300,Gemma,Looks like <@Granville> has some googling to do to narrow down the scope of his question!
1727,2019-04-17T16:31:16.175000,Pasquale,If you are parsing large volumes of data you may want to consider a 3rd party application such as Apache Kafka or IBM Streams Studio and then call your Python from inside the stream parser.  Parsing high volumes of streaming data is difficult to do well.
1727,2019-04-17T16:48:14.176100,Carmen,"By streaming data/file, do you mean a file containing data from e.g. a video stream a'la Twitch, or are you meaning a realtime appended file, a'la a logfile?"
1727,2019-04-17T16:49:36.177100,Carmen,"I'm assuming the latter, in which case you honestly need to be using infinite loops to regularly pull data from the end of the file and apply your parsing to that."
1727,2019-04-17T16:50:43.178300,Carmen,"And of course, depending on the processing that needs to be done vs the amount of data being added to the file, you might need to apply some parallel processing and task queues to the mix to get your results done in real-time."
1727,2019-04-17T17:05:38.179500,Granville,It's something like this: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5832856/how-to-read-file-n-lines-at-a-time-in-python>
1727,2019-04-17T17:06:17.180100,Granville,It's parsing a simple log file that never has an EOF because information is constantly being written to it
1727,2019-04-17T17:07:21.180800,Granville,"<@Carmen> yep, that would be more like it. I don't see anything on Real Python for this kind of stuff"

1732,2019-04-18T00:42:09.197800,Kam,it prints nothing in second case.
1732,2019-04-18T00:42:48.198500,Kam,i want to be able to assign those return values in other function.
1732,2019-04-18T00:43:28.199200,Kam,no errors in second case but no result on stdout.
1732,2019-04-18T00:44:08.200000,Kam,when i return and don't do print explicitly from within the function.
1732,2019-04-18T00:52:11.200800,Mildred,"sorry, not ignoring, looking into it.

Not something ive come up against, and not something im incredibly familiar with, but i will try anyway"
1732,2019-04-18T00:53:25.201000,Kam,It's no problem.
1732,2019-04-18T00:53:53.201400,Kam,"it's something i don't understand, maybe it's an issue with decorator"
1732,2019-04-18T00:58:31.202100,Mildred,"printing from inside the main is fine.

I would suggest its more about the fact that you are trying to print the main() function."
1732,2019-04-18T00:59:51.203200,Kam,well i mean even if I do an assignment like `result=main() print(result)`
1732,2019-04-18T01:00:00.203500,Kam,that doesn't work either.
1732,2019-04-18T01:00:29.204500,Kam,shouldn't it assign returned values from main function to `result`?
1732,2019-04-18T01:01:24.205900,Sasha,It looks like there are some code paths where invoking `main()` could lead to an error case where Click just calls `sys.exit()`. So it may be aborting the program instead of just not printing anything. Could you try to disambiguate that case by printing something before and after the `print(main())` call?
1732,2019-04-18T01:02:16.206200,Kam,$? is 0 though
1732,2019-04-18T01:02:23.206400,Kam,I can.
1732,2019-04-18T01:02:51.207200,Sasha,"That's probably not it, then, if you get a good exit code."
1732,2019-04-18T01:03:17.208100,Mildred,"<@Sasha>
i think its the way its returning the values, even by commiting main() to a variable, theres nothing there"
1732,2019-04-18T01:03:36.208600,Mildred,"i can print them inside the main, i just cant get them out"
1732,2019-04-18T01:03:39.208900,Sasha,"(As an aside, Click is weird. I've seen it come up in these channels before and the behavior is always odd in convoluted ways...)"
1732,2019-04-18T01:03:53.209200,Kam,ok so  I am trying this
1732,2019-04-18T01:03:57.209400,Kam,"```if __name__ == '__main__':
     print('test 1')
     l=main()
     print(l)
     print('test 2')```"
1732,2019-04-18T01:04:32.209700,Mildred,test 2 doesnt print does it
1732,2019-04-18T01:04:49.210200,Kam,only 'test 1' got printed.
1732,2019-04-18T01:04:55.210400,Kam,yeah.
1732,2019-04-18T01:05:03.210800,Mildred,"def main(date, instrument):
    print(""inside main: "",date, instrument)
    return date, instrument

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(""test"")
    items = main()
    print(items)
    print(""test2"")"
1732,2019-04-18T01:05:10.211100,Mildred,i get the inside and test 1 to print
1732,2019-04-18T01:05:23.211500,Kam,"The thing is i could do all my logic in one function, i just wanted to nest the logic to different functions"
1732,2019-04-18T01:05:40.211900,Kam,But since I can't use return values it makes it impossible.
1732,2019-04-18T01:06:02.212100,Kam,"yeah, same here."
1732,2019-04-18T01:06:34.212700,Kam,"I can just use argparse, it's fine. I've spent too much time already."

1732,2019-04-18T01:07:16.213800,Kam,It would of been noticed by now.
1732,2019-04-18T01:07:44.214400,Kam,and if i change the name from main to any other name i get same result as well.
1732,2019-04-18T01:31:42.215800,Kam,<@Sasha> <@Mildred> i just straced and it seem that @click.command() decorator makes a function as a command
1732,2019-04-18T01:32:15.216300,Kam,so i see after `test 1` rt_sigaction(SIGINT being called by click
1732,2019-04-18T01:33:21.217100,Kam,"which makes sense since click is trying to make the function into a good command-line citizen, so when it exit the function, it calls sys.exit() with the appropriate exit number"
1732,2019-04-18T01:33:26.217300,Kam,just FYI

Maybe passing `pages.language` and `pages.id` in function will reduce queries."

1736,2019-04-18T06:38:36.234900,Mildred,"<@Tanja> if you are plotting the nodes, why do you need the distances between them?"
1736,2019-04-18T06:40:31.237200,Jettie,"<@Darcie>
there are 6 whitespace-separated entries in each cron expression
5 of them define the time, and the last one is a path to a script"
1736,2019-04-18T06:42:31.238200,Darcie,Ok thank you.
1736,2019-04-18T06:43:21.239600,Jettie,"time format is not the most straightforward, but still not very hard
`*` or N entries in a form of `TIME/DIVISOR` or just `TIME`, separated by a comma"
1737,2019-04-18T06:40:24.236700,Kam,this one should help

1738,2019-04-18T09:21:17.240500,Deangelo,Hello
1738,2019-04-18T09:21:40.241000,Deangelo,"given:
```
a = [   a1,    a2,    a3,    a4]
```
can I build the following lists in one shot using comprehension:
```
b = [a1+c1, a2+c2, a3+c3, a4+c4]
c = [    0,    b1,    b2,    b3]
```"
1738,2019-04-18T09:22:27.241700,Carmen,"This is 90% correct. The final entry isn't just a path to a script, but a full-on shell command to run. We normally have it run a script, but just saying it's a path to a script ignores that you can redirect the outputs as with any other command, which is highly useful.

Also, if the cron entry is an entry in `/etc/crontab`, there are 7 entries. Immediately after the first 5 time entries is a parameter specifying the user to run the final command as. If it's an entry in the user crontab, then the 6-entry description is accurate."
1738,2019-04-18T09:22:32.241900,Deangelo,returning a tuple. the trick here is c takes the b value from the previous iteration
1738,2019-04-18T09:25:32.243200,Carmen,"It's not immediately clear what you're trying to produce inside each list. Are those strings, or variables defined elsewhere and expressions to calculate with them?"
1738,2019-04-18T09:25:51.243500,Deangelo,just numbers
1738,2019-04-18T09:26:44.244700,Carmen,So `a1-c1` is literally subtracting the value of `c1` from the value of `a1`?
1738,2019-04-18T09:27:02.245200,Deangelo,"a1, a2, a3 just mean first, second, third numeric elements in a"
1738,2019-04-18T09:27:10.245400,Deangelo,yes
1738,2019-04-18T09:27:24.245800,Deangelo,let me try with some real values
1738,2019-04-18T09:29:14.248900,Carmen,"If you're using those as placeholders for the lists, not just variables defined elsewhere, then the main issue I'm seeing with that is that you're defining a circular relationship between lists `b` and `c`. There's no way to calculate those values in plain Python. You'd need to use an equation solver module."
1738,2019-04-18T09:30:32.250300,Deangelo,"```
a = [2530, -23299, 2143, 2331]
b = [2530, -20769, -18626, -16294]
c = [0, 2530, -20769, -18626]
```"
1738,2019-04-18T09:31:55.251100,Carmen,Ah. I see what you're aiming for now.
1738,2019-04-18T09:32:30.251800,Deangelo,"yeah, just a substruction and a carry on of the previous element"
1738,2019-04-18T09:33:54.253300,Carmen,"I think you might be able to build something using generators, rather than a straight up list comprehension, but I think you'd be better off defining a function that builds the lists for you. Inside that function you'd just iterate as many times as you want to, appending the calculation results to each list as you go."
1738,2019-04-18T09:35:58.256000,Deangelo,"thanks <@Carmen>, I'll give generators a shot"

What do you mean by that ? sqlite ?"
1741,2019-04-18T11:16:34.261700,Nenita,that was one idea - sqlite
1741,2019-04-18T11:16:57.262300,Nenita,"but i was also trying to find a way to use odbc over vm, but i always come back to just sticking the db in a shared folder"
1741,2019-04-18T11:17:46.263100,Clemmie,what is your overarching goal? By that description things sound a little confused
1741,2019-04-18T11:17:52.263300,Jimmy,:point_up:
1741,2019-04-18T11:19:09.264400,Nenita,"long story short, im comparing two tables from two db's. One of the db's is on a vm. one db is firebird and the other is mariadb"
1741,2019-04-18T11:19:40.265400,Clemmie,"As a one off, or as a continuing process?"

1741,2019-04-18T11:20:28.266900,Nenita,"using python, ill do all the backend stuff, i just need to know the best way to access my db on my vm"
1741,2019-04-18T11:21:35.268800,Clemmie,"usually for remote db access you provide a host/port/user/pass to the client, and the remote db is open for remote connections"
1741,2019-04-18T11:21:48.269400,Jimmy,best way would have to have the db listening on the network and bridge the vms on your local network
1741,2019-04-18T11:21:56.269700,Clemmie,"being on a vm is no different, you just need to get the networking set up correctly"
1741,2019-04-18T11:22:08.269900,Deangelo,"<@Carmen> I came up with this solution using generators. Is this good enough or is there a faster alternative?
```
# given a, calculate b and c as follows
# b = [a[0]+c[0], a[1]+c[1], a[2]+c[2], a[3]+c[3]]
# c = [0,b[0],b[1],b[2]]
----
# solution:

def cycle(alist):
  b = 0
  for i, a in enumerate(alist):
    c = b
    b = a + c
    yield b, c

alist = [2530, -23299, 2143, 2331]
blist, clist = map(list, zip(*[(t[0], t[1]) for t in cycle(alist)]))
# blist = [t[0] for t in tup]
# clist = [t[1] for t in tup]
print(alist) # [2530, -23299, 2143, 2331]
print(blist) # [2530, -20769, -18626, -16295]
print(clist) # [0, 2530, -20769, -18626]
```"
1741,2019-04-18T11:22:55.270400,Nenita,"well thats good to know. never had to work with a db on vm, but really nice to know its just a simple (or should be)"
1741,2019-04-18T11:23:02.270800,Nenita,thanks ill look into the networking side of it
1741,2019-04-18T11:23:32.271400,Clemmie,"vm networking can be a bit of a hassle, but networking in general can be …. interesting"
1741,2019-04-18T11:28:04.271700,Jimmy,is that on a laptop ? server ?
1741,2019-04-18T11:28:32.272300,Nenita,its ubuntu server 18.0.4 and it will be on a desktop in the future. currently run on a desktop now.

1741,2019-04-18T11:30:41.273500,Nenita,"na, for what im trying to do it should be fairly simple."
1742,2019-04-18T12:24:27.275300,Carmen,<@Deangelo> That seems like a reasonable solution.
1743,2019-04-18T12:24:55.275800,Jamey,Hi all. I install `python3.7` on Ubuntu 18.04 alongside the system Python. Is it possible to use `venv` with it or I should just use `virtualenv`?
1743,2019-04-18T12:26:56.276100,Kam,either should work
1743,2019-04-18T12:28:01.276400,Jamey,`venv` isn't working :cry:

1743,2019-04-18T12:29:56.277200,Jamey,The above is output from `python3.7 -m venv venv`
1743,2019-04-18T12:33:17.278300,Kam,what does this do `python3.7 -m venv /tmp/my_python37`
1743,2019-04-18T12:33:50.278800,Jimmy,:point_up: `python -m venv` is the documented way now
1743,2019-04-18T12:34:16.279100,Jimmy,but looks like there is a problem in installing pip :thinking_face:
1743,2019-04-18T12:36:51.279800,Jamey,I installed pip like this `wget <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py>` and  `sudo -H python3.7 get-pip.py`.
1743,2019-04-18T12:38:39.280700,Jimmy,looks wrong
1743,2019-04-18T12:38:44.281000,Jimmy,how did you install python ?
1743,2019-04-18T12:39:09.281400,Jamey,So the system `pip`... I may have upgraded the system `pip`. Maybe that's the problem? Since Ubuntu installs `python-pip` as a package and not in the way I've done
1743,2019-04-18T12:39:35.281900,Jimmy,I don't know
1743,2019-04-18T12:39:54.282400,Jimmy,what I would do is remove the python3.7 you installed and reinstall `python-pip`
1743,2019-04-18T12:40:13.282800,Jimmy,then reinstall python3.7 (preferably with pyenv)
1743,2019-04-18T12:40:35.283200,Jimmy,afaik `pip` should be included in standard python now
1743,2019-04-18T12:41:48.284100,Jamey,I installed `python3.7` like this: `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa` &gt; `sudo apt update` &gt; `sudo apt install python3.7`
1743,2019-04-18T12:42:46.284600,Jimmy,hmm I'm not familiar with that ppa but I don't use ubuntu
1743,2019-04-18T12:43:11.285200,Jimmy,you may want to look into pyenv or maybe there is a `python3.7-pip` packages to install ?
1743,2019-04-18T13:09:40.286000,Jamey,<@Jimmy> it's alright. I removed 3.7. It is causing too much conflict.
1743,2019-04-18T13:09:43.286100,Jamey,¯\_(ツ)_/¯

1744,2019-04-18T14:05:31.292300,Karoline,then there's not a whole lot you can do aside from potentially deploying endpoints closer to the user

1748,2019-04-18T16:03:27.302000,Monika,"We are trying to apply DDD to our project (php) recently, and I really like the concepts behind it. We have a decoupled architecture and a extensive use of dependency injection and i think that is a nice approach for large app. But i don't see many of this concepts in the Python world. So the question is , what do you think about Python, dependency injection and DDD?. Thanks in advanced"
1749,2019-04-18T16:10:34.305800,Clemmie,"It’s amazing to me that consultants make money selling DDD concepts - it is just good systems design practice. In a way it is the same with Dependency injection, we don’t really talk about it much. Mostly it is because, in statically type languages dependency injection is a Big Difficult Idea :tm: leading to frameworks that abstract away the difficulties. Python is dynamically typed and so it is easy to build up Inversion of Control, to a degree that you might look at some python code and say “You are using dependency injection? I love it” and the response is “What’s dependency injection?”"
1750,2019-04-18T16:17:05.307600,Danae,"Hi all, is there any library in python which would help with creating dynamic web page (with graphics/charts) where I could hover over some items and it would display some kind of pop up with additional information ?"

1753,2019-04-18T19:22:24.321800,Lawrence,I'm unfamiliar with lexicon or azure but could it be a bad request? perhaps something with the uri?

1755,2019-04-18T22:20:04.334100,Sasha,"For Python, honestly I just use emacs. For other stuff, usually Eclipse derivatives. I'm probably not a good person to learn IDE habits from, though."

1755,2019-04-18T22:27:59.337700,Priscilla,have you used rust?
1755,2019-04-18T22:29:18.338100,Sasha,Afraid not. Worth digging into?
1755,2019-04-18T22:31:21.340300,Priscilla,"i think it is. I used it a tiny amount but found it very readable just getting started. I was interested in it because of its memory safety aspects which I didnt quite understand with C. I hear that may be why many devs dont like it, not as much control as C but I wouldn't know that lol."

1759,2019-04-19T06:51:42.345600,Kalyn,i want the info from ips or def getIpAddresses in the message
1759,2019-04-19T06:52:37.346100,Susan,note for beginner: <http://pep8.org|pep8.org> :slightly_smiling_face: snake_case and spaces
1759,2019-04-19T06:54:03.346400,Kalyn,thats something I need to work on :wink:
1759,2019-04-19T06:54:24.346700,Susan,maybe <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html> would be handy
1759,2019-04-19T06:54:56.347200,Susan,"`messages = [ ""announce flow route { match { destination"" "" ips ""  ""/32;  } then { discard;  }  }"" ]` that's just a list of one element"
1759,2019-04-19T06:55:57.348200,Kalyn,can’t use data from for loop in element?
1759,2019-04-19T06:56:00.348300,Susan,and `ips` equals None
1759,2019-04-19T06:57:05.348900,Susan,"`stdout.write(... + '\n'); flush` -&gt; `print(..., flush=True)`"
1759,2019-04-19T06:57:50.349600,Susan,"`""destination "" "" ips "" "" /32""` just equals `""destination  ips  /32""`"
1759,2019-04-19T06:58:46.350400,Kalyn,yeah trying to get that data in there but I guess I have to make a sum of lists elements

`[""prefix"", *ips, ""suffix""]`"
1759,2019-04-19T06:59:42.351100,Susan,`getIpAddresses` should `return ip_range`

1761,2019-04-19T07:59:43.364500,Nieves,Pretty sure Python has the ability to tell the datatype or whatever natively?
1761,2019-04-19T07:59:55.364900,Nieves,One sec...
1761,2019-04-19T08:00:29.365900,Ashley,"<@Nieves> yeah, selenium is slow because it's dependent on a web browser, and I don't recommend it for scraping (not just because it's dependent on a browser, but because it uses the WebDriver protocol, which can be limiting). Bs4 and requests make a very solid combo, but there's no JS engine involved, so that may limit you in other ways. There's also scrapy which is built for scraping, but I don't believe it uses a JS engine either (I could be wrong though)"
1761,2019-04-19T08:01:03.366900,Nieves,Yeah... no Selenium. Webdriver protocol needs to die btw. Thinking a mix of PhantomJS and the like...
1761,2019-04-19T08:01:22.368000,Nieves,I could always parse for JS manually
1761,2019-04-19T08:01:25.368200,Ashley,WebDriver is actually fantastic. It's just not built for scraping ;)
1761,2019-04-19T08:01:45.369400,Ashley,PhantomJS is dead though I think
1761,2019-04-19T08:01:47.369500,Nieves,all the tools I have seen for scraping use selenium and I always shake my head
1761,2019-04-19T08:01:48.369800,Nieves,No

1761,2019-04-19T08:01:52.370300,Nieves,PhantomJS is alive and well

1761,2019-04-19T08:03:14.374300,Alvina,you can still push buttons and all of that stuff? I know i am navigating through pages and people have some weird date selection popups which threw me off when I tried bs4 or whatever (this is years ago)
1761,2019-04-19T08:03:17.374500,Ashley,Very true
1761,2019-04-19T08:03:37.375500,Ashley,"However, it may not be worth it, since chromium is open source and now has a headless mode"
1761,2019-04-19T08:03:44.375800,Nieves,I have been going through some very bad Perl code for a tool and well... been thinking of modifying it and make it more modern.
1761,2019-04-19T08:03:58.376400,Nieves,but whatever... time to get going
1761,2019-04-19T08:04:07.376700,Nieves,Let's see how many swear words I say over python
1761,2019-04-19T08:07:10.380800,Ashley,"<@Alvina> with bs4, you can't really click buttons. It's just an XML parser that was designed with HTML in mind and there's no JS engine involved, but IIRC it knows how to emulate certain behavior should you want to click certain buttons. It's pretty simple to do though if you know how HTML forms work (it boils down to a web request to the server at the designated endpoint with the values from the form in a certain format)"
1761,2019-04-19T08:07:28.381200,Nieves,buttons are in html
1761,2019-04-19T08:07:41.381700,Nieves,Or forms... which is still html
1761,2019-04-19T08:07:46.381900,Ashley,"Yeah, but bs4 can't ""click"" them"
1761,2019-04-19T08:07:52.382200,Ashley,As in there's no click event
1761,2019-04-19T08:07:57.382500,Nieves,not really click them
1761,2019-04-19T08:08:00.382900,Nieves,xD
1761,2019-04-19T08:08:33.384800,Alvina,selenium was a bit easier to wrap my head around because it was literally the steps I would do manually
1761,2019-04-19T08:08:34.385000,Nieves,"I can't remember exactly how buttons work, but don't they have a link coded into them?"
1761,2019-04-19T08:08:41.385500,Ashley,"But it can try to look at what sort of requests that would send to the server if it's a standard form and no JS trickery is going on, and it might be able to send a request like it"
1761,2019-04-19T08:08:50.385900,Ashley,Not exactly
1761,2019-04-19T08:08:52.386100,Alvina,even headless was easy to set up with some intermediate screenshots and trial and error
1761,2019-04-19T08:08:52.386200,Nieves,JS can be blocked?
1761,2019-04-19T08:09:10.387200,Nieves,I know on FF... you can disable JS
1761,2019-04-19T08:09:13.387700,Nieves,and others
1761,2019-04-19T08:09:18.388300,Alvina,"yeah, some of our sites are custom company made ones with a ton of javascript and mess"
1761,2019-04-19T08:09:22.388600,Nieves,Not a web-dev
1761,2019-04-19T08:09:23.388900,Nieves,lol
1761,2019-04-19T08:09:33.389500,Alvina,"so I am not pulling data from standard nice websites, most of the time"
1761,2019-04-19T08:09:33.389600,Nieves,<@Alvina> tell them to fix their code
1761,2019-04-19T08:09:38.389900,Nieves,or markup language
1761,2019-04-19T08:09:47.390600,Ashley,"If they're not part of a form, then bs4 can't do anything with them because that would require the ability to run JS to trigger the resulting behavior"
1761,2019-04-19T08:09:52.391200,Nieves,Ight...
1761,2019-04-19T08:09:55.391600,Alvina,"haha - if these people are still with the company and if anyone actually has any idea what is going on, I would be amazed"
1761,2019-04-19T08:10:10.392600,Nieves,Most in CS (no offense) are just bad at it
1761,2019-04-19T08:10:11.392800,Alvina,"we have 7 different versions of our attendance website across the globe, each geo is different"
1761,2019-04-19T08:10:16.393000,Nieves,CS requires a certain wired brain
1761,2019-04-19T08:10:23.393300,Ashley,"If they're part of a form, they'd usually have a type like `submit`, which would then have the form submit to the server"
1761,2019-04-19T08:10:30.393700,Nieves,Yeah... that is what I was trying to say
1761,2019-04-19T08:10:35.394100,Ashley,The form is what has the link and request method knowledge
1761,2019-04-19T08:10:48.394500,Nieves,"pretty much, you can fill the form out... send a post request and than see what response is returned..."
1761,2019-04-19T08:10:53.394900,Nieves,Success is 200
1761,2019-04-19T08:10:59.395100,Ashley,Yep
1761,2019-04-19T08:11:09.395400,Nieves,Yeah... remember messing around with Burp and cURL
1761,2019-04-19T08:12:33.396200,Ashley,"Also, <@Alvina> that's exactly what selenium/WebDriver is meant for; emulating user interactions"
1761,2019-04-19T08:12:39.396400,Nieves,Sigh... already issues in Pycharm
1761,2019-04-19T08:13:11.397300,Ashley,Vs code has a good python plugin. Very customizable

1761,2019-04-19T08:13:45.398000,Nieves,So yeah...
1761,2019-04-19T08:13:52.398300,Nieves,VSC++ isn't bad though
1761,2019-04-19T08:14:01.398700,Nieves,Once you figure out WinAPI and WinINet
1761,2019-04-19T08:14:35.399600,Ashley,Vscode runs great on Linux. MS actually just created an official snap package for it
1761,2019-04-19T08:14:41.399800,Nieves,I know
1761,2019-04-19T08:14:45.400000,Nieves,I just don't like MS that much
1761,2019-04-19T08:14:48.400200,Nieves,They are doing better
1761,2019-04-19T08:15:05.401000,Nieves,Probs should move this conversation to random so the admins don't complain
1761,2019-04-19T08:15:06.401100,Ashley,They're really kissing ass to the Linux/Dev commuting lately
1761,2019-04-19T08:15:15.401400,Nieves,Oh they are cuz Linux is the future
1761,2019-04-19T08:15:27.401700,Nieves,They will need to adapt or go bankrupt
1761,2019-04-19T08:15:37.402000,Ashley,"Yeah, let's take it to random"
1762,2019-04-19T09:02:33.403000,Susan,`__kwdefaults__` is `A dict containing defaults for keyword-only parameters.` <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/>
1762,2019-04-19T09:05:03.404100,Nieves,Just took a peek at dogpile and the data it returns via burp... strange... it uses multiple different apis from like bing and such.
1762,2019-04-19T09:11:08.405900,Claudine,"I've gotta do some vetting for API testing frameworks. My initial thought is to just go with selenium and mock data, anyone have any other suggestions?"
1762,2019-04-19T09:16:08.406400,Hiroko,<@Claudine> what do you mean by api testing?
1762,2019-04-19T09:16:21.406800,Hiroko,Load testing?
1762,2019-04-19T09:16:35.407500,Nieves,REST JSON?
1762,2019-04-19T09:16:37.407700,Claudine,oh no like automatic unit testing and stuff
1762,2019-04-19T09:16:38.408000,Hiroko,E2e external tests?
1762,2019-04-19T09:16:43.408200,Claudine,to make sure it's working
1762,2019-04-19T09:16:43.408300,Nieves,Why selenium?
1762,2019-04-19T09:17:01.408800,Claudine,"im familiar with it, it can hit endpoints"
1762,2019-04-19T09:17:23.409500,Claudine,coupled with a DB connection we can validate the data it creates on POST/PUTs
1762,2019-04-19T09:18:20.410700,Hiroko,So integration tests 
1762,2019-04-19T09:18:24.411000,Claudine,yea
1762,2019-04-19T09:18:26.411100,Nieves,Is selenium the only lib/module that you understand?
1762,2019-04-19T09:18:39.411700,Nieves,There are prolly other libs that can be imported that do a more efficient job
1762,2019-04-19T09:18:44.412100,Claudine,"i can pick up anything fairly easy, i believe"
1762,2019-04-19T09:18:53.412600,Hiroko,"If this is an api, it's returning json or xml, right?"
1762,2019-04-19T09:19:05.413300,Nieves,Probs a REST JSON API
1762,2019-04-19T09:19:08.413500,Claudine,"yes, 99% json with 1 endpoint that returns XML"
1762,2019-04-19T09:19:23.414000,Hiroko,Why not just use requests and hit the endpoints and compare with what you expect?
1762,2019-04-19T09:19:44.414800,Nieves,Was thinking that as well <@Hiroko>
1762,2019-04-19T09:19:54.415100,Nieves,"Like, selenium is fine for certain things"
1762,2019-04-19T09:19:58.415300,Nieves,But is bloated a bit
1762,2019-04-19T09:20:14.416100,Nieves,Most likely all you have to do is check the results that is returned so selenium is a bit much?
1762,2019-04-19T09:20:19.416200,Nieves,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1762,2019-04-19T09:20:32.417000,Claudine,agreed selenium is not as fast as requests for this situation. there is a possibility that this API will be extended far past the current use case in future
1762,2019-04-19T09:20:42.417600,Hiroko,Selenium is good when you need to interact with a browser without needing a display 
1762,2019-04-19T09:20:45.417800,Claudine,so i as thinking a selenium based test suite would be extensible in that case
1762,2019-04-19T09:20:51.418200,Hiroko,And sloooow
1762,2019-04-19T09:20:55.418400,Claudine,very slow
1762,2019-04-19T09:20:55.418500,Nieves,Yeah... so selenium is a bad idea for the future if it might get bigger (?)
1762,2019-04-19T09:21:05.419000,Nieves,:/
1762,2019-04-19T09:21:16.419800,Nieves,In a business and such... faster is better
1762,2019-04-19T09:21:21.420200,Hiroko,Why not stick to current api responses?
1762,2019-04-19T09:21:29.420700,Claudine,"well i might need to do some DOM/browser stuff in the future, suppose i could always use beautifulSoup for that"
1762,2019-04-19T09:22:04.421700,Hiroko,What's 'future' mean here in your timeline?
1762,2019-04-19T09:22:23.422000,Claudine,maybe a year out but i probably won't still be here
1762,2019-04-19T09:22:39.422400,Claudine,maybe half a year out depending on what Q4 looks like
1762,2019-04-19T09:23:29.423100,Nieves,Q4?
1762,2019-04-19T09:23:35.423400,Claudine,Quarter 4
1762,2019-04-19T09:23:36.423600,Nieves,so QQQQ?
1762,2019-04-19T09:23:38.423800,Nieves,xD
1762,2019-04-19T09:25:35.424400,Hiroko,Sounds too far in the future for actual planning and implementation 
1762,2019-04-19T09:26:00.425200,Hiroko,"Because requirements can and will change from now and then, if it ever comes along "
1762,2019-04-19T09:27:00.425500,Nieves,"And also, 10+ code that doesn't work anymore is a pain to fix and cleanup"
1763,2019-04-19T09:57:45.427300,Cordell,That's a long documentation..  but I found it. thanks
1763,2019-04-19T10:01:17.429300,Ashley,"Just throwing it out there, but Selenium itself and the WebDriver protocol are very fast and lightweight. The bottleneck is the browser (and your connection to the site) which is why Selenium is a great choice for tests that inherently require a browser anyway. Not so great of a choice if you don't need the browser"
1763,2019-04-19T10:09:56.430000,Nieves,Ight <@Ashley> admit it... you fanboy Selenium... &lt;//3
1763,2019-04-19T10:15:32.431000,Ashley,"Nah, I just understand how it works and where it should/can be used (and where it shouldn't)"
1763,2019-04-19T10:20:55.431200,Nieves,I am also joking around
1764,2019-04-19T10:29:17.432300,Claudine,I decided to go `requests` initially with a note that selenium could be useful in the future
1764,2019-04-19T10:30:33.433200,Claudine,"we're probably 40% through this project, in a perfect world we would have built tests concurrently, or done some TDD"
1764,2019-04-19T10:39:30.434000,Nieves,Or just not use Pyt-... (slinks away)
1765,2019-04-19T10:40:42.435100,Avelina,"hi, try to find a python tool/script which can mask/filter PII csv file, so I can load that new csv file into CLOUD DB for testing. For example the table has 100 columns, 1 column is PII , and 1 column has float (sensitive value)."

1766,2019-04-19T10:59:22.438000,Clemmie,you need to fix your indentation -  and also you should be using the moderns `print()` function

1768,2019-04-19T12:43:13.441600,Alvina,the line_number will remain consistent with the original csv file as long as I do not sort the data right?
1768,2019-04-19T12:43:39.442300,Alvina,"so if I get an error on line 2402, i should be able to find it easily with that column?"
1768,2019-04-19T12:43:59.442600,Alvina,or if I open the csv with sublime text

1770,2019-04-19T13:21:05.450500,Sasha,<@Avis> It's not quite clear what you're asking.
1771,2019-04-19T14:10:21.451600,Avis,<@Sasha> I created a function in which I defined two variables and i would like to pass it to another function maybe I mixing my terminology
1771,2019-04-19T14:12:58.452300,Sasha,"That's totally fine and standard. If a variable exists where the function is being called from, you can pass it to the function."

1771,2019-04-19T14:22:13.453500,Avis,the idea is that i pass my two variables to my second method def checker
1771,2019-04-19T14:23:38.453700,Avis,Not too sure what's the best way to accomplish.
1771,2019-04-19T14:25:00.453900,Sasha,Are you running into any problems with this? It looks pretty normal.
1771,2019-04-19T14:25:59.454500,Sasha,"Though your `for` loop looks problematic, since you're reassigning `values1` while iterating over it."
1771,2019-04-19T14:26:11.454900,Carmen,"Not unless you have some other way to filter out files, or be informed of the existence of file modifications/additions."
1771,2019-04-19T14:28:31.455100,Avis,I guess is this the conventional way of creating a function and passing the variables to another function ?
1771,2019-04-19T14:28:59.455300,Avis,yea i noticed when i remove the print statement it gives me an error in the for loop
1771,2019-04-19T14:32:27.455600,Sasha,"It's slightly non-conventional in that you're wrapping up the return values and passing them as a unit. It works, but it can be hard to understand what's going on. Often people would do:
```def checker(values, past):
  ... stuff ...

def main():
  values, past = check_indices()
  checker(values, past)```
That just makes it more obvious to the reader what kind of data is being generated and passed in."
1771,2019-04-19T14:37:15.455900,Avis,can you suggest any good books or literature  that would fill in the gaps.  what's a little confusing is the fact that arguments we are giving the functions checker is the same as the parameter.
1771,2019-04-19T14:41:33.456100,Sasha,"You mean using the same name? Yeah, that needs a little twist of your mindset... `def checker(values, past)` is basically saying, ""Whatever thing is passed to this function in the first parameter, I'm going to label it `values` inside my function code, no matter what it was called before. And the second thing is now labeled `past`, even if the outside variable was named `hot_dogs`."""
1771,2019-04-19T14:42:30.456300,Sasha,"Variable names are intended to help humans reading the code, but to the compiler, their meaning has very strict restrictions, so you want to remember that they're fundamentally arbitrary."
1771,2019-04-19T14:46:38.456500,Avis,ahh:thinking_face: so what's more important is the arguments we are passing the function.rather  than the parameter name ?
1771,2019-04-19T14:49:58.456700,Avis,its making sense :pray: ah man Thanks !
1771,2019-04-19T14:57:28.456900,Sasha,"No problem. Actually, Python can pass arguments both by position and by name. The latter is mostly used if you have a large number of optional arguments. So you might see `foo(one, two, special=True)`, where `one` and `two` are just the generic first and second arguments, but `special` is a named argument."
1771,2019-04-19T15:19:50.457100,Avis,I'll keep that one in mind ....yeah there was some examples on the net some  people using *args and * kwargs as parameters as well
1771,2019-04-19T15:22:45.457500,Sasha,"Yep, that's useful when you want to have a function take a variable number of arguments and be able to process them like a list or a dict. It doesn't come up a lot, but it can be handy in certain cases."
1772,2019-04-19T16:17:12.458300,Cathern,Anyone have a clean way to diff two function blocks in two files? Python-specific if that makes it easier
1772,2019-04-19T16:17:25.458600,Cathern,"I don't want to diff two files, just the func blocks"
1772,2019-04-19T16:19:46.459200,Cathern,I would think grepping out the function block(s) then diffing those would be an option - but haven't figured it out
1772,2019-04-19T16:21:52.459500,Cathern,"Meh, I'll probably just do it in python by the look of things"
1773,2019-04-19T16:36:58.460100,Priscilla,i dont understand why I put `self` as an argument in functions...
1773,2019-04-19T16:41:00.460700,Clemmie,This is a pretty good explanation <https://micropyramid.com/blog/understand-self-and-__init__-method-in-python-class/>
1773,2019-04-19T16:41:44.461600,Sasha,I think <@Priscilla> meant that he gets into the habit of including `self` even in non-method functions.
1773,2019-04-19T16:48:39.462000,Priscilla,im only supposed to add it in method functions?
1773,2019-04-19T16:49:01.462500,Priscilla,thanks <@Clemmie> that article looks interesting!
1773,2019-04-19T17:37:47.463300,Priscilla,"how come this function gives me an attribute error after returning the correct output?

I am calling it with `print(ser_menu().output)`"
1773,2019-04-19T17:40:21.464500,Priscilla,everything online says this happens when a function returns `None` but that isnt the case since it returns a string right?
1773,2019-04-19T17:47:08.467300,Sasha,"The print statement is implying that the function returns an object with an ""output"" attribute. A regular return value is just unnamed, so you'd want to print just the value ""ser_menu()""."
1773,2019-04-19T17:51:39.470500,Sasha,"Or in other words, a return statement returns the value of a thing, irrespective of the variable name inside the function... ""return output"", ""return foo"", or ""return 114"" are all okay and the caller can't tell the difference."
1773,2019-04-19T17:53:08.471200,Priscilla,"oh neat it worked, but how come it adds and extra `None` now when i run it?

`Service menu test -&gt; PASS
None`"
1773,2019-04-19T17:54:38.473100,Sasha,"The return value of a print statement is None. So you print correctly inside the function, but return an output value of None to be printed by the outer print statement."
1773,2019-04-19T17:55:53.473300,Priscilla,:confused:
1773,2019-04-19T17:56:26.474200,Sasha,Do you want to return a string instead of printing it inside the function?
1773,2019-04-19T17:57:17.474900,Priscilla,oh! i need to just  call it like `ser_menu()` instead of `print(ser_menu())`

1776,2019-04-20T03:37:02.478400,Conchita,I forgot to mention that its type is `&lt;class 'google.cloud.pubsub_v1.subscriber.message.Message'&gt;`
1776,2019-04-20T03:37:13.478700,Conchita,Can't really figure out how to work with it
1776,2019-04-20T03:43:44.479400,Conchita,Figured it out! `solution = message.data`
1776,2019-04-20T05:14:14.480600,Conrad,"incase you want to access an attribute, there really are only two ways I know of in python - the `.` (for objects), and the `[]` access (for dictionaries and arrays).
good that you figured it out!"
1777,2019-04-20T07:51:40.481000,Jerrie,"Hi Team, i need some help here. i wanted to remove &lt;structures:HumanPatient&gt; and &lt;structures:NonVeterinarian&gt; tag completely without changing any other part of xml
Thanks in advance."
1777,2019-04-20T07:56:43.482200,Leida,Do you wish to get rid of the contents of the tag too?
1777,2019-04-20T07:59:22.483100,Leida,i would convert the xml to a string and then use `string.find()` to locate the beginning and the end and slice those parts out
1777,2019-04-20T08:03:16.485800,Leida,"```
beginning = string.find(""&lt;structures:NonVeterinarian&gt;""
end = string.find(""&lt;/structures:NonVeterinarian&gt;
output = string[:beginning] + string[end+len(""&lt;/structures:NonVeterinarian&gt;:]```"
1777,2019-04-20T08:04:41.486800,Leida,"this loops it through twice tho so its not super efficent, you can narrow down the find if you know how much there is stuff before it/after"
1777,2019-04-20T08:05:14.487500,Leida,"`string.find(""string"", begin, end)`"
1777,2019-04-20T08:05:37.487900,Leida,here begin and end are indexes from which you start looking and stop looking
1777,2019-04-20T08:06:19.488500,Jerrie,i do'not want to get rid of the contents . i just wanted to remove the tags
1777,2019-04-20T08:07:07.489500,Leida,but both beginnig one and closing one?
1777,2019-04-20T08:07:16.489700,Jerrie,yes
1777,2019-04-20T08:07:25.490100,Jerrie,i am adding the desired result
1777,2019-04-20T08:07:38.490400,Jerrie,None
1777,2019-04-20T08:07:52.491000,Jerrie,This is the desired result of the xml. after removing both tag
1777,2019-04-20T08:09:13.492300,Leida,"```
output = string[:beginning] + string[beginning+len(""&lt;structures:NonVeterinarian&gt;""):end] + string[end+len(""&lt;/structures:NonVeterinarian&gt;"":)```"
1777,2019-04-20T08:09:52.492900,Leida,i guess it would be nicer if you cut out all the pieces and then added them together
1777,2019-04-20T08:10:16.493600,Leida,"basically you have a string `good bits, bad bit, good bits, more bad, good`"
1777,2019-04-20T08:10:34.494000,Leida,so cut 3 sections each of the good parts and then add the parts
1777,2019-04-20T08:12:32.497300,Leida,"```
first_good = string[:beginning]
second_good = string[beginning+len(opening_tag):end]
third_good = string[end+len(closing_tag):]
sum = first_good + second_good + third_good```"
1777,2019-04-20T08:13:23.498400,Leida,`find` finds the index of the place the substring begins
1777,2019-04-20T08:13:39.498800,Leida,and you get the end index using `len(string)`
1777,2019-04-20T08:14:16.499300,Jerrie,"This is great help. thanks.
can it be done by element tree. by just removing those tags and will return the desired xml. i am trying to parse it  with element tree and then remove those element."
1777,2019-04-20T08:15:20.000200,Jerrie,xml with namespace making it tough to remove child tag
1777,2019-04-20T08:16:15.001100,Leida,"idk much about xml manipulation, just you should be able to serialize it into a string, cut out the parts and then reverse serialize it to xml"
1777,2019-04-20T08:17:23.002100,Leida,if the xml is massive or you need to do it often then some xml tool is probably the way to go
1777,2019-04-20T08:18:01.002600,Jerrie,Thanks karl. i am gonna try your way
1777,2019-04-20T08:19:18.003500,Leida,"if you are reading from a file then you could open the .xml file and read it in as a string, do the cutting and then call `ElementTree.parse()` on the string to have it as elementtree"

My thought was to store a list of objects which have a value (positive or negative) and a date. I want to be able to iterate through the list to display the value of the current entry as well as the running total.

Any thoughts? Esp. about optimizing it or whether that's a waste of time. I think it will typically hold no more than a few hundred entries"

I'm using `autobahn-python` for the websocket server, but it needs to run on the main thread.  Is there any issue with running my http server on a child thread?"
1780,2019-04-20T16:42:00.010200,Fredric,I'm thinking there should be a Ledger.as_sorted_ledger() method that returns the list with all entries having the running total as a property
1781,2019-04-20T16:47:06.010400,Melia,None
1781,2019-04-20T16:55:13.010700,Fredric,None
1782,2019-04-20T17:47:53.011200,Vicente,"Not sure if It understand, you want use while loop instead of recursion ?"
1783,2019-04-20T18:39:48.014800,Milly,"Hello all, How would I present the patient who spent the most? I have a multidimensional list here and I am thinking to do a loop to find out who that patient is? Would this be the correct thinking? Am I missing something? I'm not sure how I would do that."
1783,2019-04-20T18:44:00.016100,Sasha,"Yep, a loop would be perfectly fine. You can also potentially use a quick list comprehension with tuples:
```amount, name = max((x[1], x[0]) for x in patients)```"
1783,2019-04-20T18:49:45.016300,Milly,"Ah! Thanks, <@Sasha>! Should I be changing my list to a tuple to do that?"
1783,2019-04-20T18:50:38.016500,Sasha,"No, that's not necessary... anything you can iterate over will work the same way."
1783,2019-04-20T18:51:34.016700,Sasha,"However, you may consider changing to a dict, with the name as the key and the cost as the value. That way you wouldn't need to scan through it to look someone up, etc."
1783,2019-04-20T18:52:58.016900,Sasha,Depends how you want to use the data.
1783,2019-04-20T18:53:11.017100,Milly,"Okay, I have a dictionary that I already made but I wasn't sure if the integers only could called."
1783,2019-04-20T18:53:26.017300,Milly,"patient1={""name"": ""NatalieGarcia"",
""primarycare"": ""Dr.Bryson"",
""treatment"": insulin,}
for x in patient1:
	print(patient1)
	break"
1783,2019-04-20T18:54:50.017500,Sasha,"Gotcha. For something like that, you might also consider having a patient class, with name, treatment, etc. as attributes."
1783,2019-04-20T18:55:52.017700,Sasha,"Dicts tend to be better when the keys are ""data"" as well, like mapping states names to state capitals. If the keys are few and standardized, a class can make better sense. But either way can work."
1783,2019-04-20T18:56:00.017900,Milly,Oh I haven't learned about classes yet. okay! and that way I could find which out of all my patients received the most expensive treatments?
1783,2019-04-20T18:57:00.018100,Sasha,"Almost any data structure will let you find the maximum cost with some sort of a loop, so that'll be relatively easy no matter how you organize things."
1783,2019-04-20T18:59:08.018300,Milly,"so for what you provided me before, nothing comes up. so would i put print(max(patients) afterward? because I'm only given the first name and cost as a result and thats not the most expensive."
1783,2019-04-20T18:59:50.018500,Milly,Sorry for all the messages. I've been having the same issue for like two days. :woman-facepalming:
1783,2019-04-20T18:59:52.018700,Sasha,"Sorry, just do `print(name, amount)` to display the result."
1783,2019-04-20T19:00:05.018900,Sasha,The answer is just assigned to those variables.
1783,2019-04-20T19:00:38.019200,Milly,Ah! That worked!
1783,2019-04-20T19:00:45.019400,Milly,So the same for minimum I presume.
1783,2019-04-20T19:00:58.019600,Sasha,"Yep, just use `min()` instead."
1783,2019-04-20T19:01:50.019800,Milly,Oh the question was second highest. So how would I find that?
1783,2019-04-20T19:02:24.020000,Milly,You're seriously the best! I really appreciate this!
1783,2019-04-20T19:03:30.020200,Sasha,"It's not quite the most efficient, but the easiest way is to sort the list, and then you can pick off whatever rank you want. Do you actually want me to show you the answer, or is this a problem you're supposed to solve by yourself, and you just want a hint?"
1783,2019-04-20T19:06:39.020400,Milly,"No, just you explaining the thought process is helping. I've done the foundation already. But yes, I know about the pop method so I'll try that."
1783,2019-04-20T19:08:19.020600,Milly,"I've only learned to programme 4 days ago so I'm still trying to understand how to think ""like a programmer""."
1783,2019-04-20T19:08:27.020800,Sasha,"Sure thing, and feel free to ask if you get stuck. You shouldn't really need the `pop()` method, since if you have a sorted list, you can directly access each element by `[0]`, `[1]`, etc."
1783,2019-04-20T19:10:01.021000,Sasha,"4 days? That's awesome! But yeah, it does take some time to gain a problem-solving intuition, especially if you don't know what all the possibilities are yet."
1783,2019-04-20T19:11:10.021200,Milly,"Yes, the ""possibilities""! That's exactly it."
1783,2019-04-20T19:13:37.021400,Milly,"&amp; Thank you again! I'll keep cranking away at this code. You said ""feel free to ask"" so I'll be back if I get into any more trouble lol. :grinning:"
1783,2019-04-20T19:14:30.021600,Sasha,"Absolutely. And if I'm not around, the folks in <#C07EW4DNE|learning_python> and <#C07EFMZ1N|help> are great resources too."
1784,2019-04-20T20:24:13.023400,Priscilla,"I dont know how to tackle this problem. I need to take a serial number from the user, then run a number of functions and have the values from those functions append to the corresponding serial number. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
1784,2019-04-20T20:24:56.023800,Priscilla,it must be soooo common
1784,2019-04-20T20:27:16.024800,Sasha,"Can you expand on ""append""? Do you literally mean append to a string, or is it more like the values need to be associated with the serial number in a database?"
1784,2019-04-20T20:30:49.025500,Priscilla,"litterally append, its all going into a csv and the serial number and all asociated test values will be on the same row"
1784,2019-04-20T20:33:46.028300,Sasha,"This sounds simple, but there are probably some subtleties. Maybe this:
```serial = input(""Please enter your serial: "")
result = serial + func1(serial)
result += func2(serial)
result += func3(serial)```
If you have many functions, you can loop over them with a `join()` on the results, too."
1784,2019-04-20T20:35:37.029800,Sasha,"Or you could do string formatting: `result = ""{}-{}-{}"".format(serial, func1(serial), func2(serial))`."
1784,2019-04-20T20:37:44.030600,Priscilla,"hmmm... the latter was my first idea, but it wasnt working, hangon i got an idea"
1784,2019-04-20T20:51:59.032800,Priscilla,"ERROR `can only concatenate str (not ""module"") to str`"
1784,2019-04-20T20:54:16.034500,Priscilla,"expected output needs to be `serial, PASS/FAIL` as you can see on line 5 I convert it to a string but the error seems to think its not a string"
1784,2019-04-20T20:55:39.034900,Sasha,"Okay, there's a decent amount wrong with this, but which line is throwing the error, to start with?"
1784,2019-04-20T20:56:11.035600,Sasha,It sounds like there's some confusion between the `import serial` module and your `serial` variable?
1784,2019-04-20T20:56:31.035900,Priscilla,oh my god i think so...
1784,2019-04-20T20:57:08.036200,Priscilla,line 18 and 20
1784,2019-04-20T20:57:56.036700,Sasha,How are you calling `keypad_sim_display()`?
1784,2019-04-20T21:00:38.037200,Priscilla,in my main function I have a all the functions running in the order necessary so its like this
1784,2019-04-20T21:02:33.037800,Priscilla,im not going to like what comes next... i can feel it... in mah bones
1784,2019-04-20T21:05:08.038300,Sasha,When you use `serial` there in the function call... where exactly is it coming from?
1784,2019-04-20T21:05:43.038800,Priscilla,its returned from the `ser_num()` at line 3
1784,2019-04-20T21:06:44.040100,Sasha,"If it were returned, you would have `serial = ser_num()`, right?"
1784,2019-04-20T21:07:17.040800,Priscilla,"so the first thing the user doses is assign a serial number to a device, then the functions lines 6-9 run. if all of those pass according to `keypad_sim_display()` then it will append the word PASS to the serial number"
1784,2019-04-20T21:08:11.041500,Priscilla,what do you mean?
1784,2019-04-20T21:08:21.041800,Priscilla,sorry i dont understand your question
1784,2019-04-20T21:10:01.042400,Priscilla,here it is without the conflict of `serial`
1784,2019-04-20T21:10:30.043200,Sasha,"When a function returns a value, if you need to do anything with it, you need to capture it to a variable, like `result = foo()`. Otherwise it is just discarded."
1784,2019-04-20T21:11:43.044300,Priscilla,isnt that saving it in a variable on line 4? i thought it was
1784,2019-04-20T21:12:13.044600,Priscilla,or do you mean outside of the function?
1784,2019-04-20T21:13:15.045100,Sasha,"Outside of the function. ""What happens in a function, stays in the function"", for the most part."
1784,2019-04-20T21:13:25.045300,Priscilla,oh! i see
1784,2019-04-20T21:18:30.045700,Priscilla,omg omg omg
1784,2019-04-20T21:19:17.046500,Priscilla,"im so excited!!  thanks <@Sasha> again! spent hours on that, i learned a LOT whooop whoooooP!"
1784,2019-04-20T21:19:35.046800,Priscilla,:tada:
1784,2019-04-20T21:26:43.047300,Priscilla,who pays for this slack room? do we know who is the owner?
1784,2019-04-20T21:27:54.047800,Sasha,"AFAIK it's just using the free Slack tier, which is why there's no extended history available."
1784,2019-04-20T21:28:15.048000,Priscilla,oh
1784,2019-04-20T21:28:40.048600,Karoline,there are a couple ancillary services related to the bot and the site and such that are paid for but yeah the slack itself is the free tier
1784,2019-04-20T21:29:32.049000,Priscilla,wubalubadubdub!!
1784,2019-04-20T22:45:10.049600,Priscilla,wouldnt appending a csv be putting a new row and not adding to a row?
1784,2019-04-20T23:11:50.051300,Priscilla,"as a programmer, what information comment my work with? name? date? name of program? is there a standard way to do it? or should I leave any identifying information out of it?"
1784,2019-04-20T23:18:24.053900,Priscilla,should i put my name or my LLC name?
1784,2019-04-20T23:20:16.054100,Priscilla,eh i put both
1784,2019-04-20T23:33:02.054600,Priscilla,when is a function name too long?
1784,2019-04-20T23:38:35.055300,Conchita,Whenever :point_up::skin-tone-2: question pops into your mind
1784,2019-04-20T23:51:00.058400,Priscilla,good point <@Conchita>
1785,2019-04-20T22:47:34.050100,Clayton,Anybody use 'SpaCy'  ?
1786,2019-04-20T23:15:46.053400,Sasha,"It varies a lot. Name and date at least is a good way to be able to assert copyright if that's ever needed. Personally I try to also include a program name and just a quick ""what the heck is this thing for"" description to at least jog my memory years from now."
1786,2019-04-20T23:40:40.057000,Sasha,"It sort of varies with use. Commonly-used functions ought to be short, like `read()`. If it's specialized and only gets called from one place in one library, go ahead and call it `ReadBudgetSpreadsheetIntoDatabase()`."
1786,2019-04-20T23:42:57.057800,Sasha,But turn off tab completion for a while before you decide long names are fun.  :wink:
1786,2019-04-21T00:16:12.059900,Conchita,Have a feeling <@Sasha>  have the answer
1786,2019-04-21T00:16:52.060500,Sasha,"It's a convention for a class-private variable. It's not enforced like some other languages, but it lets other coders know that they're not ""supposed"" to mess with those attributes, at least."
1786,2019-04-21T00:18:54.061400,Sasha,"Whereas `client_id` doesn't have that, so it implies that the author of the class allows you to access `foo.client_id` as a public API for the object."
1786,2019-04-21T00:19:29.062000,Conchita,"So there are both public and private classes, didn't know that!"
1786,2019-04-21T00:19:49.062400,Conchita,And variables
1786,2019-04-21T00:20:19.063400,Sasha,"There aren't, from a Python language perspective, but it's a common concept in, say, Java, which can be useful to borrow."
1786,2019-04-21T00:20:50.063900,Conchita,Do you have any example for when its useful with a private class?
1786,2019-04-21T00:21:39.064700,Conchita,Just to get a high-level idea of the use cases
1786,2019-04-21T00:23:35.067000,Conchita,OS and hardware related stuff?
1786,2019-04-21T00:24:06.067600,Sasha,"Sure. For instance, say you're writing a class which connects to, say, a USB device. You need to maintain a connection to it, and keep track of particular command sequences. It would be a real problem if some other code came in and just randomly borrowed your connection to send other commands or flip some bits in your state. You want your code to be able to rely on the fact that only you can access and change those things, while providing other users with some friendly functions to call instead."
1786,2019-04-21T00:26:01.068400,Sasha,"Again, none of this is actually enforced in Python. It's just a way for people to know that they're ""breaking the rules"" if they start poking at the inner logic of a class."
1786,2019-04-21T00:28:11.069800,Sasha,"And sometimes you actually want to break the rules, if you're writing a unit test which wants to examine some of that behavior."
1786,2019-04-21T00:28:26.070200,Conchita,Thanks for the explanation! So its basically a `Don't push this big fat red button` haha
1786,2019-04-21T00:28:34.070500,Sasha,Exactly!
1786,2019-04-21T00:28:37.070600,Conchita,"""Stuff might happen"""
1786,2019-04-21T00:29:12.071200,Conchita,Enjoy the :taco:  <@Sasha>
1786,2019-04-21T00:30:19.072500,Sasha,"It can also save you a lot of time in reading other people's code, as you can tell that big long functions starting with an underscore are ""behind the scenes"" and not something that you might need to call to use the library."
1786,2019-04-21T00:31:20.073500,Conchita,"Is this what is grouped as ""low-level""? And maybe part of the reason why its not enforced in Python, as Python is a high-level language?"
1786,2019-04-21T00:33:14.075300,Sasha,"Not really... low- versus high-level usually refers to how close to the patterns of the underlying hardware you are, like whether you have to worry about CPU registers and memory addresses, or only deal in more abstract things like ""dicts""."
1786,2019-04-21T00:33:46.075600,Conchita,"Ok, got it"
1786,2019-04-21T00:35:20.077300,Conchita,"Another question, do you have a process for reading other people's code? It feels like I spend way to much time to understand code I have NOT written myself (to a level of understanding where I will modify their code)"
1786,2019-04-21T00:42:14.080800,Sasha,"I tend to work from the ""outside"" moving in. Start with any documentation and public APIs, then a quick scan through the files to just see what is where. Sometimes the unit tests, if there are any, can provide some nice examples of how the functions are called in practice. Then I make sure I understand any key data structures. And lastly just read line by line, hopefully only targeting a section of the code which I know I'm interested in, although sometimes I have to do a code-review of everything."
1786,2019-04-21T00:43:33.081800,Sasha,"But it is a learned skill by itself, and reading bad code can be a challenge for anyone. I've been a bit fortunate to mostly work with great coders, so reading their stuff can be a breeze."
1786,2019-04-21T00:47:52.084000,Conchita,"That sounds like a nice approach - I started line by line, and later discovered the code was let's call it ""un-impressive"", as it was not functioning as the author claimed + no single line of comment / documentation"
1786,2019-04-21T00:48:40.084400,Sasha,Ugh
1786,2019-04-21T00:49:04.085000,Conchita,I'm gonna apply your approach next time!
1786,2019-04-21T01:05:16.085700,Priscilla,<@Sasha> do you have any degrees?
1786,2019-04-21T01:05:28.086000,Priscilla,if you dont mind me asking...
1786,2019-04-21T01:07:21.087100,Sasha,"Technically just a bachelors in physics and math, though I went pretty far into a Ph.D. program before dropping out."
1786,2019-04-21T01:07:48.087400,Priscilla,are you glad you got that bachelors?
1786,2019-04-21T01:09:05.087900,Priscilla,i mean like is it relevant to programming and useful in this field?
1786,2019-04-21T01:10:54.089500,Priscilla,assuming this isnt just your hobby but also your hjob
1786,2019-04-21T01:12:56.091200,Sasha,"Yes, I think so... IMHO any sort of technical degree is generally useful for developing the sort of rational problem-solving skills that programming relies on. So it's not specifically useful, but it's generally useful. That said, I started programming from a very young age too, so I probably would have ended up doing some level of coding regardless."
1786,2019-04-21T01:14:02.091600,Priscilla,interesting how old are you?
1786,2019-04-21T01:14:26.091800,Sasha,Now? 40's.
1786,2019-04-21T01:14:43.092100,Priscilla,when did you get in tpo programming?
1786,2019-04-21T01:16:03.093200,Sasha,"Back in the 80's, the early days of home computers like the Commodore 64."
1786,2019-04-21T01:16:55.094200,Priscilla,haha cool! i work under an engineer at work who used those in college it would be cool to have
1786,2019-04-21T01:18:25.095200,Sasha,"Really was a great machine. And it booted up to a BASIC prompt, so the invitation to do some coding was unavoidable."
1786,2019-04-21T01:20:36.095600,Sasha,"```10 PRINT ""HELLO""
20 GOTO 10```"
1786,2019-04-21T01:21:04.095900,Priscilla,neat!
1786,2019-04-21T01:21:53.096600,Priscilla,i am looking at learning basic here soon!
1786,2019-04-21T01:22:37.097100,Sasha,"It's probably not really worth it these days, except as just an exercise."
1786,2019-04-21T01:23:53.098400,Priscilla,"thats why i want to learn it, understand a lower language and the people i talk to its the most relevant languge to them for some reason lol"
1786,2019-04-21T01:24:22.099100,Priscilla,every analogy to me (the programmer in the company) is explained in basic lol
1786,2019-04-21T01:25:02.099300,Sasha,Amusing...
1786,2019-04-21T01:26:00.100200,Priscilla,only because they are electrical or mechanical or optical engineers and have only dablled i guess
1786,2019-04-21T01:31:19.101900,Sasha,"The limitations of the language sound crazy today. All variables are global, and can only be named a max of two letters, and only be numbers or strings. No such thing as a function, but you can GOSUB to a line number and then RETURN to where you came from."
1787,2019-04-21T00:15:05.059000,Conchita,"Why the use of `_` like `_signer`?``` self._service_account_email = service_account_email

1788,2019-04-21T07:53:40.103900,Nieves,Basic is dead
1788,2019-04-21T07:53:44.104100,Nieves,And for good reason
1788,2019-04-21T07:53:51.104500,Nieves,It had flaws that made it die out
1788,2019-04-21T07:54:01.104900,Nieves,"Although, still fun to read about"
1789,2019-04-21T08:23:05.105900,Leida,could someone explain to me how to use sessions in a code free manner
1789,2019-04-21T08:23:31.106500,Leida,im sending a form on post and i want it to be editable in the same session
1789,2019-04-21T08:24:34.107500,Leida,so i should on post create a session or record the session id and send the inserted data back. On new post i should check if its the same session?
1789,2019-04-21T08:27:38.108600,Leida,since i dont have any authentication i should just save the session id in the db with the data and once it expires either a new entry is created or some error thrown...

1790,2019-04-21T10:38:15.112500,Nieves,"If it returns anything, but like 200... it ‘won’t work’"
1791,2019-04-21T10:58:07.113600,Conchita,"Do you see the line about credentials? I'm not certain, but it can be that you have to do the following;"
1791,2019-04-21T10:59:39.115700,Conchita,"1. Register for Google Cloud (you get plenty of free credits, no need to pay anthing)
2. Create a IAM Service Account
3. Right after step 2, create a key file and download its JSON file
4. replace `gspread-april-2cd … ba4.json` with the path to your own JSON file"
1791,2019-04-21T10:59:57.115900,Leida,i dont know about gspread but i used pygsheets and there you just reference your client_secret.json
1791,2019-04-21T11:01:00.116500,Leida,i think the scope allows you to narrow down the access scope you give to your python script

1791,2019-04-21T11:04:46.117900,Nieves,I would think is what you would need as well?

1791,2019-04-21T11:08:37.119700,Nieves,Yeah... you need to retrieve the access token before you can send the request
1791,2019-04-21T11:08:40.119900,Nieves,Pretty sure
1791,2019-04-21T11:08:45.120200,Nieves,No idea... never used that before
1791,2019-04-21T11:09:11.121100,Nieves,The token would need to also be passed probs as a parameter in the request
1791,2019-04-21T11:09:19.121300,Nieves,And than get results
1791,2019-04-21T11:09:27.121600,Leida,its probably wrapped by the library
1791,2019-04-21T11:09:36.121900,Nieves, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1791,2019-04-21T11:09:36.122000,Leida,the one i used does that automatically
1791,2019-04-21T11:09:42.122200,Nieves,Not a web dev
1791,2019-04-21T11:09:45.122400,Nieves,So no idea
1791,2019-04-21T11:13:36.123200,Nieves,Most likely even if it does it automatically there is a function where you could specify what you need anyways
1791,2019-04-21T11:13:57.123800,Nieves,The automatic process is usually default values 
1792,2019-04-21T11:04:33.117300,Nieves,API key?
1793,2019-04-21T15:24:35.125300,Melia,I wanted to achieve the following and after trial and error I achieved it
1793,2019-04-21T15:26:06.125500,Melia,"def retroCounter2(number):
    if number &gt; 0:
        print(""{}\n"".format(number), end = """")
        while number &gt; 0:
            (retroCounter2(numero - 1))
            return numero
    else:
        pass"
1793,2019-04-22T02:24:05.136600,Conchita,Reason I ask is I'm writing unit tests now and it feels like it would make sense to move a piece of logic into a separate function
1793,2019-04-22T02:26:51.137600,Sasha,"That's a good reason. If you ever find yourself using ""and"" in the function name, that's another sign, heh heh."
1793,2019-04-22T02:28:34.138200,Sasha,"Some people go by the ""if it's longer than easily fits on my screen"" rule."
1793,2019-04-22T02:36:05.138900,Conchita,I'm just trying to make it easily readable and testable
1793,2019-04-22T02:40:41.140000,Sasha,"Go for it. A too-long function is sufficient, but certainly not necessary."
1793,2019-04-22T03:06:04.143500,Chester,"<@Conchita> I have two reasons:
1. a part of the logic is required to be re-used by another function (I like to copy-paste things that look familiar before refactoring the duplication)
2. it contains more than 15-20 lines of code (this is a very vague limit, for performance critical things it can be extended without a doubt)"
1793,2019-04-22T03:07:20.144300,Chester,"For example, I have this function <https://github.com/malinoff/amqproto/blob/master/amqproto/serialization.py#L99-L156> that spans over more than 50 lines, but this is a requirement because this function needs to perform fast"
1793,2019-04-22T03:08:21.144900,Chester,"If you look at other functions/methods in amqproto, you'll mostly see bodies with less than 10 lines"
1793,2019-04-22T03:08:26.145100,Chester,usually 3-4
1793,2019-04-22T03:20:18.146700,Chester,These are relative imports
1793,2019-04-22T03:20:23.146900,Conchita,And why do you have import statements in the bottom of the file?
1793,2019-04-22T03:21:23.148100,Chester,"The comment says it :slightly_smiling_face: I use functions from `serialization` module in `methods` and `content` modules, but for convenience I also use `Method` and `Content` methods in `serialization`"
1793,2019-04-22T03:22:31.148600,Conchita,I read the comment but my current Python lvl isn't high enough to know it lol
1794,2019-04-21T21:56:56.129800,Sophia,"hi, need guidance on easiest way to do this. i have multiple assets, each with multiple data points. I’m looking to assign a value to each asset based on decisions on each of these data points. As an example, each asset being a house, and data points including number of windows, garage door, broken fence, etc., each house would have a score. Is there a recommended way of coding this besides a bunch of if statements and adding/subtracting from a score?"
1794,2019-04-22T00:46:48.134400,Rebeca,"<@Sophia> Your question is quite vague. But here is a way. Assign “costs” to each data point`a_i`  on your asset. Assign a weight `w_i` to each `a_i`. Then for all `n` data points in your asset, your score is the dot product:
```
S = a1*x1 + a2*x2 + ... an*xn
```"
1795,2019-04-22T02:23:09.135600,Conchita,How do you know when to refactor and split logic in one function into 2 or more?
1795,2019-04-22T02:35:40.138500,Conchita,`if it's longer than easily fits on my screen` nowhere near that haha
1795,2019-04-22T02:58:01.140500,Valeri,<@Conchita> I follow SRP strictly for everything
1795,2019-04-22T02:58:24.141100,Valeri,Every block of code should try and do just one thing and do it well
1795,2019-04-22T03:19:33.146300,Conchita,"Thanks for the example, will take a closer look at it later. For now I noticed something else in your code - in the bottom you have this ```# Avoid circular imports problem.
from .methods import Method  # noqa
from .content import Content  # noqa
```
Why the . in `.methods`?"
1796,2019-04-22T04:17:36.150000,Nena,"hey folks, using python2,
{'01': 'something1', '02': 'something2', '03': 'something3', '04': 'something4'} to ordered list with keys as 01, 02, 03, 04"
1796,2019-04-22T04:21:26.150300,Conchita,Not sure if I catch what you mean. This will print the keys to terminal.
1796,2019-04-22T04:23:56.150600,Nena,"<@Conchita> my bad, need preserve the order of the dict. convert unordered dict to an ordered dict"
1796,2019-04-22T04:24:32.150800,Conchita,Where is the disorder?
1796,2019-04-22T04:24:38.151000,Conchita,What is not in order?
1796,2019-04-22T04:26:35.151200,Nena,"okay, when i create a variable and save this dict, it creates a hash for each key which is totally random and implements a reference to the key and fetched value accordingly. this changes the order of the dict. need to preserve the order"
1796,2019-04-22T06:47:14.157900,Valeri,"<@Nena> You need
```
import collections
collections.OrderedDict(dict)
```"
1797,2019-04-22T05:03:04.151400,Chester,Use `collections.OrderedDict`
1797,2019-04-22T07:05:42.162000,Conchita,"Nice, taking notes"
1797,2019-04-22T07:10:30.163500,Hiroko,"note that there’s a limit to what can be done compared with java and c# because while python is strongly typed, it is not static so there’s lots of things that will only be available at runtime"
1798,2019-04-22T06:09:09.155400,Oretha,"There could be lots of heuristics, but a few would be if to ensure your function does ‘only one thing’, and if you find lots of scopes ie high ‘cyclomatic complexity’. I personally like making code read almost like a series of sentences, and each sentence is a well names fn. "
1798,2019-04-22T06:25:33.156900,Oretha,The object oriented approach would presumably be something like polymorphic cost and a sum fn that iterates over a list of assets to get a total
1798,2019-04-22T06:53:00.161900,Oretha,"Anyone out there using VS Code? I am curious about experienced people’s dev workflow. In particular in statically typed I am used to jumping into definitions left right and center and seeing how packages/modules are put together, what fns and objects available etc. I don’t want to look up on the web but have everything self service within the editor. What do people do in practice?"
1798,2019-04-22T07:09:40.162500,Hiroko,<@Oretha> do you have the python vscode package installed?
1798,2019-04-22T07:30:53.169900,Oretha,"Yep, I’ve got myself set up and can step into a certain amount of stuff but it is fairy limited. Understandably some stuff only at runtime, but I am curious to know best practice. Eg if I have a dictionary keys() in python3 that gives a View. Id like to explore what I can do with it without resorting to the web. For productivity reasons I am guessing people use a repl in parallel or other ways of exploring code - after all the code is the documentation. So am curious how people work in practice (and some IDE eg Spyder may offer more out the box in this regard). "
1798,2019-04-22T07:33:02.171000,Karoline,Is your concern about needing to go to the web becauase of access issues (like on a train or somewhere without internet) or just because you prefer not to break your flow and say in the editor?
1798,2019-04-22T07:45:43.175500,Oretha,"The second. I prefer going to the web if I need something in depth, but don’t want to do that to understand how a module or class are put together. I want to avoid breaking flow and feel more productive if I can do all in one place. Eg for the above understanding views by looking at code, autocomplete options, unit test code etc. "
1798,2019-04-22T07:47:12.176500,Karoline,"makes sense.  for me - it's a combination of the method completion, exploration via the REPL, and yeah the web and/or Dash (and offline docs tool)"
1798,2019-04-22T07:48:01.177400,Karoline,is the standard method completion not working for you?
1798,2019-04-22T07:49:39.179600,Oretha,"It does some of the time, but eg at runtime I don’t have additional options I know how to use ( eg i have a deep stack, an object, and want to understand that object in more detail)"
1798,2019-04-22T07:50:47.181200,Karoline,so it's more a question then of the runtime interaction of the code and the objects used?
1798,2019-04-22T07:50:48.181300,Oretha,Ultimately I just want to know what people find works for them - I know it may not match what you get in eg a good scala IDE. 
1798,2019-04-22T07:51:51.182700,Oretha,"Probably yes, that would be one pinch point. And how best to explore core libraries. "
1798,2019-04-22T07:52:22.183100,Karoline,For that sort of thing I usually find myself using the debugger
1798,2019-04-22T07:57:35.185200,Oretha,Makes sense. Not at a screen right now but maybe I haven’t made enough of it. If anyone else has commentary on their most productive workflow (web-light) then I am interested to hear the variations!

1799,2019-04-22T08:47:42.194000,Alvina,is it possible to use a Docker container (Linux) on windows and the win32com library? I need to download some mail from outlook
1799,2019-04-22T08:48:52.194700,Karoline,there are some .NET things you can get running under Linux
1799,2019-04-22T08:49:14.195200,Karoline,is it a requirement that the container be linux?  there are windows containers as well.
1799,2019-04-22T08:51:02.195500,Alvina,"hm, I have a lot of linux containers running"
1799,2019-04-22T08:51:10.195800,Alvina,I have not messed with a windows container at all
1799,2019-04-22T08:53:06.197400,Karoline,"I've never personally used them, but it's potentially an option - although it's my understanding you can't mix the two (Linux and Windows) containers on the same machine, and the Windows containers only work on Windows as you'd expect."
1799,2019-04-22T08:54:12.198300,Karoline,you might have more luck asking in <#C297RQP0X|os_linux> or <#C5XHHMXHB|os_windows> though - for now though I'd just ignore the docker aspect of it.  the key question is whether you can use win32com on linux.
1799,2019-04-22T10:34:54.200300,Kam,i have this function
1799,2019-04-22T10:35:20.200400,Kam,None
1799,2019-04-22T10:35:47.201100,Kam,communicate doesn't seem to work.
1799,2019-04-22T10:59:20.201500,Jonas,You might want to explain why it does not work
1799,2019-04-22T10:59:30.201700,Jonas,`<https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run>` is a better method to use
1799,2019-04-22T11:01:13.204300,Kam,"Let me try, thank you."
1800,2019-04-22T09:06:18.198500,Alvina,"ah right, thanks"
1800,2019-04-22T10:34:35.200100,Kam,"Is there anyway to send stdout,stderr from subprocess.Popen or subprocess.call to my logger from standard logging module?"
1801,2019-04-22T10:59:54.202400,Jonas,"`output = subprocess.run('lftp', '...', capture_output=True)`"
1801,2019-04-22T11:00:09.202800,Jonas,then just `output.stderr` and `output.stdout`
1801,2019-04-22T11:00:24.203200,Kam,shove that into the logger?
1801,2019-04-22T11:00:27.203400,Jonas,sure
1801,2019-04-22T11:01:53.205100,Kam,oh is it also available for 3.6?
1801,2019-04-22T11:06:20.205900,Kam,"actually it just uses  kwargs['stdout'] = PIPE
    kwargs['stderr'] = PIPE in src code"
1801,2019-04-22T11:06:37.206200,Kam,"so i can just do stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE"
1801,2019-04-22T11:12:08.206800,Milly,"Morning, all. I don't think I'm setting this class up correctly. Could guide me through what I'm missing?"
1801,2019-04-22T11:12:54.207300,Clemmie,that `pass` will confuse things
1801,2019-04-22T11:13:20.207700,Clemmie,also `Insulin` is a string and needs quotes
1801,2019-04-22T11:13:49.208500,Clemmie,and `pat_1=Patient` (notice the uppercase P)
1801,2019-04-22T11:14:43.209300,Milly,oh!! I didn't know capitalization matters:woman-facepalming: okay. thank you <@Clemmie>
1801,2019-04-22T11:14:56.209500,Clemmie,:thumbsup:
1801,2019-04-22T11:16:42.210400,Milly,"<@Clemmie> what does error mean? ""this constructor takes no arguments"" do you know?"
1801,2019-04-22T11:16:54.210600,Milly,this error*
1801,2019-04-22T11:17:41.211300,Clemmie,It means you are passing arguments that a constructor doesn’t use. But in your case that is a red herring - the `pass` is mixing things up
1801,2019-04-22T11:17:45.211500,Clemmie,get rid of it
1801,2019-04-22T11:18:26.212000,Milly,"oh, I removed it like you suggested, but i'm still getting that error."
1801,2019-04-22T11:18:42.212300,Clemmie,show the whole code and the error
1801,2019-04-22T11:19:02.212700,Clemmie,never mind - `__init__` requires 2 underscores before and after - you only have one
1801,2019-04-22T11:19:29.213300,Milly,"Error:   pat_1=patient('NatalieGarcia','Dr.Bryson', 'Insulin', 30)

1801,2019-04-22T11:19:33.213700,Valeri,<@Milly> Mind the P in patience
1801,2019-04-22T11:19:40.213900,Valeri,It should be uppercase
1801,2019-04-22T11:19:56.214200,Milly,Oh the class name is always captial?
1801,2019-04-22T11:20:06.214500,Clemmie,"by convention, yes"
1801,2019-04-22T11:20:12.215000,Valeri,Also
1801,2019-04-22T11:20:19.215400,Milly,Oh. Let me fix that.
1801,2019-04-22T11:20:19.215500,Valeri,It's __init__
1801,2019-04-22T11:20:27.215800,Valeri,Double underscores
1801,2019-04-22T11:20:49.216000,Valeri,You need to fix that too
1801,2019-04-22T11:22:39.216900,Clemmie,are you coming from another programming language <@Milly>?
1801,2019-04-22T11:24:21.218700,Milly,Ah okay thank you <@Clemmie> &amp; <@Valeri>! I'm really just taking programming up for the first time now. I have dabbled in HTML but I don't consider it my first language. I'm just learning python now and its been running me around in circles.
1801,2019-04-22T11:24:43.219100,Milly,"I don't think I have a good foundation, but I'm trying lol"
1801,2019-04-22T11:25:16.219500,Valeri,Keep trying :rareparrot:
1801,2019-04-22T11:26:02.220100,Milly,"Haha, definitely. <@Valeri>"
1801,2019-04-22T11:27:47.220300,Kam,None
1801,2019-04-22T11:27:54.220700,Kam,if i use this
1801,2019-04-22T11:28:39.221600,Kam,it seem subprocess adds '\n' to the argument since i get and error for source path
1801,2019-04-22T11:28:59.221800,Kam,`b'mirror: Access failed: No such file (/feeds/cts/2019/04/19)\n'`
1801,2019-04-22T11:29:13.222100,Kam,where as
1801,2019-04-22T11:29:59.222600,Kam,"```download_cmd = subprocess.call(['lftp', f'sftp://{ftp_instance[""user""]}:{ftp_instance[""password""]}@{ftp_instance[""host""]}', \

1801,2019-04-22T11:30:02.222800,Kam,works
1801,2019-04-22T11:31:05.223300,Karoline,you have an unterminated quote somewhere
1801,2019-04-22T11:31:37.223700,Kam,"Okay, looking."
1801,2019-04-22T11:31:42.223900,Karoline,the `\` isn't needed - don't think that's it but remove it?
1801,2019-04-22T11:34:12.224200,Kam,"my bad, never mind the question."
1801,2019-04-22T11:34:19.224500,Kam,there is no data for that date.
1801,2019-04-22T11:34:51.225100,Kam,I ran subprocess.run with date argument which doesn't have data in ftp source.
1801,2019-04-22T11:35:06.225300,Kam,Sorry for confusion.
1801,2019-04-22T11:40:31.225700,Kam,Also guys i get this output in the logger
1801,2019-04-22T11:41:13.226500,Kam,is there a way to format it proper way with newlines and all?

1802,2019-04-22T11:48:21.227600,Jonas,You get bytes back. There is an option to read as text 
1802,2019-04-22T11:48:30.228100,Claudine,"it's a byte string, you want to convert it to a regular string"
1802,2019-04-22T11:48:31.228200,Jonas,Or you can decode it manually 
1802,2019-04-22T11:52:49.228400,Kam,yeah there is
1802,2019-04-22T11:53:18.229000,Kam,in 3.6 it's `encoding='utf-8'`
1802,2019-04-22T11:53:35.229400,Kam,in 3.7 it's `text=True`
1802,2019-04-22T11:53:42.229600,Kam,"Thank you, guys."
1802,2019-04-22T12:01:19.233700,Clemmie,what have you tried <@Milly>?
1803,2019-04-22T12:00:25.233100,Al,"I have a project where I need to run a websocket server and http server.  The websocket server can't be run on a child thread, so I'm currently running the http on a child thread, but I'm not sure if this is a good practice.  When running both on the main thread, the websocket server was blocks and the http server never starts.  I'm not sure if there's a way for them to share an event loop on the main thread.  This is Python 2.7."
1803,2019-04-22T12:04:03.234100,Milly,"I just can't think through the logic here. I was able to do something similar with amount,name but I its not working here.  I want to just do print max of duration but I know its not as simple as that."
1803,2019-04-22T12:06:29.235100,Junie,You mean you want the array where number is maximum?
1803,2019-04-22T12:09:14.236600,Milly,<@Junie> yes. have i set the array up correctly to get that?
1803,2019-04-22T12:09:33.237200,Clemmie,"sure, but your code is doind all sorts of things wrong"
1803,2019-04-22T12:10:18.238700,Junie,How to write code type syntax?
1803,2019-04-22T12:10:44.239200,Clemmie,"the comparison doesn’t work, the print statement is confused, and the break logic, even if everything else worked as written, would just return the first person with a duration over 5"
1803,2019-04-22T12:11:03.239900,Clemmie,But you _are_ thinking in the correct general direction
1803,2019-04-22T12:12:08.241800,Milly,Yes! that's whats happening! At least my thinking isn't completely wrong. lol <@Clemmie> I just don't know how to execute what I have in my head.
1803,2019-04-22T12:12:27.242400,Clemmie,None
1803,2019-04-22T12:12:54.243300,Junie,"For x durations:
A= []
A.append(x[0]

Max(A)"
1803,2019-04-22T12:12:59.243500,Clemmie,you need to have a placeholder to compare through the elements
1803,2019-04-22T12:13:17.244400,Clemmie,you only want to compare x[1] (the numeric part)
1803,2019-04-22T12:13:18.244500,Junie,<@Clemmie> it will work
1803,2019-04-22T12:13:29.244800,Junie,Yeah I think
1803,2019-04-22T12:13:45.245400,Clemmie,"<@Junie> code will work if you want just the max value, and not the person it belongs to"
1803,2019-04-22T12:14:06.245900,Milly,so how do i know when to use placeholders next time? or should that be the default thing I do when setting something up?
1803,2019-04-22T12:14:25.246700,Milly,also I'm trying it now.
1803,2019-04-22T12:14:33.247100,Junie,<@Clemmie> how to write msg like code snippets?
1803,2019-04-22T12:14:33.247200,Clemmie,if you need to keep track of something then you will need a var to keep track of it

1806,2019-04-22T15:33:53.260100,Kam,with shell=True i thought shell was supposed to expand it for me.
1806,2019-04-22T15:36:31.260800,Karoline,"I always have to muck with that every time to remember the right combination of settings - but if I recall that actually should be a list of arguments, right?"

1806,2019-04-22T15:39:33.261600,Kam,i think it's a string if shell=True

1807,2019-04-22T19:51:49.268300,Kam,something like `/usr/illumon/illumon-maystreet-12234323/bin/sip_pcap_binlogger`

1807,2019-04-22T20:00:53.273100,Kam,I guess i could list files with pathlib.Path(path_to).glob(illumon-maystreet*) and then select the latest one.

1807,2019-04-23T00:13:41.284900,Kam,"```class Mess_in_Bin_Conveter_Stdout_Filter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
        if record.getMessage().startswith('Processed'):
            pass
        else:
            return record.getMessage()```"
1807,2019-04-23T00:14:09.285400,Kam,then in logger configuration i have `_file_handler.addFilter(Mess_in_Bin_Conveter_Stdout_Filter())`
1807,2019-04-23T00:14:39.285900,Kam,"applied to the logger, but it's still logging all those messages."
1807,2019-04-23T00:14:49.286100,Kam,is there anyway to check
1807,2019-04-23T00:24:12.287400,Sasha,That'll also verify that your filter is bring called.
1807,2019-04-23T00:26:04.288200,Kam,"```Well i mean here is the example:

1807,2019-04-23T00:36:53.291400,Kam,yeah i can try to print
1808,2019-04-22T20:21:04.277100,Sasha,Would it be possible to maintain a consistently-named symlink to the correct version?
1808,2019-04-22T20:34:44.278500,Sasha,I guess we can be thankful that they don't do release management with `sip_pcap_binlogger.release.new.newer.with_patch.latest2`.
1809,2019-04-22T21:02:52.279300,Alethea,How does the `%{__python}` syntax work? I saw this here <https://python-rpm-porting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/application-modules.html>
1810,2019-04-23T00:23:45.287100,Sasha,"You might try printing the `getMessage()` value... I'm slightly suspicious that it may have more stuff in it before the ""Processed"" string."
1810,2019-04-23T00:27:50.289000,Sasha,"Are the ""Processed"" lines being generated by logging calls, or just being printed to stdout?"
1810,2019-04-23T00:36:11.291100,Sasha,Cool. Can you verify that your filter is being called?
1810,2019-04-23T00:38:05.292200,Kam,so instead of `pass` just do `print(getMessage())` inside of class?
1810,2019-04-23T00:38:37.292700,Sasha,"Or raise an exception, or whatever. I'm just worried that it's not correctly attached to the handler somehow."
1810,2019-04-23T00:40:09.293000,Kam,"yeah, one sec"
1810,2019-04-23T00:45:01.293800,Kam,so this command as a subporcess argument should replicate `'echo -e Processed 107367496 Packets\nJust a test'`
1810,2019-04-23T00:45:22.294300,Kam,since original command takes 30 mins to finish
1810,2019-04-23T00:47:30.295400,Sasha,"Does the original command output a gazillion ""Processed"" lines that are logged all in one block? If so, the beginning of the first line might have some other stuff."
1810,2019-04-23T00:49:02.295700,Kam,"yeah, i think that's the case"
1810,2019-04-23T00:49:11.296000,Kam,since once the command finishes
1810,2019-04-23T00:49:30.296500,Kam,when i tail the log it spills all stdout at once.
1810,2019-04-23T00:49:51.296800,Kam,with gazillion of those messages
1810,2019-04-23T00:50:09.297100,Kam,but they all seem to start on the new line
1810,2019-04-23T00:50:13.297300,Kam,here how it goes
1810,2019-04-23T00:51:12.298100,Sasha,"Well, note that the filter is probably going to be called once per log unit, not once per line. So all the output in your `convert_out` will be the message."
1810,2019-04-23T00:51:54.298300,Kam,"```[DEBUG  ] (140222127471104) 2019-04-22T20:31:57.019979-00:00:00: /bp/bellport/src/bp/feed/utdf/aggregated_price_feed.cpp(42): Initializing utdf_binary feed

1810,2019-04-23T00:52:22.298600,Kam,oh i see.
1810,2019-04-23T00:52:35.299200,Sasha,So maybe what you want your filter to do is actually iterate through the lines and modify the message.
1810,2019-04-23T00:52:36.299300,Kam,so I can do re.match i guess
1810,2019-04-23T00:54:33.300500,Kam,so i can do `for line in getMessage(): do blah` in my class I guess.
1810,2019-04-23T00:55:08.301000,Sasha,"Yeah, that will actually loop by character, but you can use `split('\n')`, etc."
1810,2019-04-23T00:57:56.301400,Kam,okay so i've added this code
1810,2019-04-23T00:58:20.301700,Kam,"```class my_bin_convert_filter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
        if record.getMessage().startswith('Processed'):
            print('hello world')
        else:
            return record.getMessage()```"
1810,2019-04-23T00:58:54.302100,Kam,"and got ```python3 maystreet_v2.py --instrument cts --date 2019-04-18 --directory ./drezden
hello world```"
1810,2019-04-23T00:59:48.302600,Kam,but in the log i don't see another message
1810,2019-04-23T01:00:06.303000,Kam,from another line `Just a test`
1810,2019-04-23T01:00:40.303700,Sasha,"Remember, the `getMessage()` result is both lines, since they were output in one big string by the subprocess call."
1810,2019-04-23T01:01:28.304100,Kam,so it matches both lines as one message
1810,2019-04-23T01:01:57.304600,Sasha,"Yes, the message would be `""Processed 107367496 Packets\nJust a test""`."
1810,2019-04-23T01:02:22.305000,Kam,so if i do `for line in getMessage().split('\n')`:
1810,2019-04-23T01:04:29.305600,Kam,something like this:
1810,2019-04-23T01:04:31.305900,Kam,"```class my_bin_convert_filter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):

1810,2019-04-23T01:04:52.306600,Sasha,"It looks like filters are allowed to modify the `msg` attribute of a record if they want. Note that they just return `True` or `False`, though, not the data."

1812,2019-04-23T07:18:43.341000,Alvina,the only risk I can see is that removing some special symbol might create a duplicate column name
1812,2019-04-23T07:18:58.341600,Alvina,"like value_(min), value_min"
1812,2019-04-23T07:19:00.341800,Hiroko,"file names, I guess"
1812,2019-04-23T07:19:04.342200,Alvina,some weird edge case
1812,2019-04-23T07:19:07.342400,Hiroko,"but column names in a db, no"
1812,2019-04-23T07:19:23.342700,Conchita,Maybe I should take a look at either `google-auth` and `oauthlib`
1812,2019-04-23T07:19:50.343300,Hiroko,"I would.  those projects are supported, and doesn’t seem like you have anything requiring to use the current one"
1812,2019-04-23T07:20:10.344000,Hiroko,<@Alvina> why would you want a slug as a column name?
1812,2019-04-23T07:20:12.344100,Conchita,"Yep, my need / case is pretty simple"
1812,2019-04-23T07:20:30.344900,Alvina,"well, my convention is lowercase underscore"
1812,2019-04-23T07:20:38.345300,Alvina,and some symbols are not allowed in postgres at all

1812,2019-04-23T07:20:52.345900,Alvina,i find it cleaner to get rid of symbols when possible
1812,2019-04-23T07:21:03.346300,Hiroko,anytime!
1812,2019-04-23T07:21:21.347000,Hiroko,<@Alvina> I still can’t understand why you want to have slugs as a db column name
1812,2019-04-23T07:21:29.347300,Hiroko,are you really changing your schema that much?
1812,2019-04-23T07:22:21.348200,Alvina,a lot of my data comes from files which can contain anything (especially Excel)
1812,2019-04-23T07:22:55.348600,Alvina,"if spaces are in the column name, I would need to add quotes as well"
1812,2019-04-23T07:23:27.349200,Hiroko,are you trying to 1:1 the spreadsheet as much as possible?
1812,2019-04-23T07:23:45.349700,Alvina,"i keep the raw column names from DB sources, and REST APIs (after unnesting the data)"
1812,2019-04-23T07:24:01.350500,Hiroko,"if you’re using postgres, why not use the jsonb type?"
1812,2019-04-23T07:24:52.351300,Alvina,my database is essentially just staging for a visualization tool which only accepts CSV uploads (REST API)
1812,2019-04-23T07:25:17.351900,Alvina,"I do make use of jsonb, but then I need to unnest it as actual columns to send to the tool so it creates more work eventually"
1812,2019-04-23T07:26:10.352000,Alvina,None
1812,2019-04-23T07:26:30.352700,Alvina,I do keep track of the actual source file (original file name and modified timestamp) as part of each table though
1812,2019-04-23T07:26:50.353100,Alvina,so changing the column names is not a huge deal

1828,2019-04-23T22:18:45.431800,Oda,“item” is this long nasty log file line.
1828,2019-04-23T22:26:07.432100,Raguel,"you can try something like this:

1830,2019-04-24T01:03:50.440700,Chester,"You need to have `setup.py`/`setup.cfg` and do `pip install -e .` beforehand.
These are basically the proper way to append to `sys.path`"
1830,2019-04-24T01:04:06.441000,Conchita,Aha
1830,2019-04-24T01:04:27.441700,Conchita,Never touched setup.py before. Will take a look at that
1830,2019-04-24T01:04:31.441900,Chester,"Although it's not very common to have multiple top-level packages, why do you have them?"
1830,2019-04-24T01:04:45.442800,Chester,"If you move all your code in a single package, your relative imports will work"
1830,2019-04-24T01:05:04.443300,Sasha,You may be missing an `__init__.py` file?
1830,2019-04-24T01:05:41.444100,Conchita,Maybe I'll do that instead. Just wanted to seperate different scripts based on their utility
1830,2019-04-24T01:06:05.444600,Conchita,Never user either of `__init__.py` or `setup.py`
1830,2019-04-24T01:07:20.445900,Conchita,"Do you recommend I:
a) place all code into a single package
b) Setup `setup.py`
c) Setup `__init__.py`"
1830,2019-04-24T01:07:36.446400,Conchita,I'm ms confused right now lol
1830,2019-04-24T01:07:41.446600,Sasha,Never mind about `__init__.py`... that seems to be optional in Py3 now.
1830,2019-04-24T01:08:01.447000,Chester,"No, it's not"
1830,2019-04-24T01:08:23.447800,Conchita,I think option a) would be easiest and wont have any negative implications?
1830,2019-04-24T01:08:40.448300,Chester,"`__init__.py` is still mandatory. When this file is missing, python3 will still work, but it will do a slightly different thing"
1830,2019-04-24T01:08:47.448600,Chester,rather than a regular import
1830,2019-04-24T01:09:18.449200,Chester,"<@Conchita> if you want to have a package, `__init__.py` is mandatory. You can't go without creating it, really"
1830,2019-04-24T01:09:46.449600,Chester,I think reading <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html> is a must for every python developer at some point
1830,2019-04-24T01:10:03.450100,Chester,Especially the part about using `setup.cfg` <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#configuring-setup-using-setup-cfg-files>
1830,2019-04-24T01:10:18.450400,Conchita,Ok will do thanks :taco: <@Chester>
1830,2019-04-24T01:10:55.451000,Chester,"Alternatively, you can use `poetry` <https://github.com/sdispater/poetry/> that hides all that `setup.py`/`setup.cfg` related complexity from you"
1830,2019-04-24T02:24:30.454300,Chester,"You can't by design. Make your tasks idempotent, and the problem disappears.
Of course, you can always implement your own distributed locking mechanism."
1830,2019-04-24T02:31:47.456000,Chester,Idempotent means that multiple invocations of the same execution request result in only one and only outcome.
1830,2019-04-24T02:32:21.456900,Chester,"E.g. an idempotent task that updates a value in a database may check first if the value is already updated, and do nothing"

1834,2019-04-24T08:26:39.467900,Jettie,it's a good exercise probably
1834,2019-04-24T08:26:50.468200,Christina,i mean you can do a recursive function
1834,2019-04-24T08:27:06.468300,Jimmy,even better this should use f-string
1834,2019-04-24T08:27:45.469100,Christina,yeah. but isn't there some issues with join inside a string-interpolated string?
1834,2019-04-24T08:28:30.469900,Mica,"nah it should be good, just don't use the same type of quotes for join as you do for the full string"
1834,2019-04-24T08:28:34.470100,Christina,i was wrong
1834,2019-04-24T08:28:39.470400,Christina,"`f""{','.join(l[:-1])} and {l[-1]}""`
works"

1834,2019-04-24T08:29:25.471300,Christina,yep
1834,2019-04-24T08:29:36.471800,Jimmy,"should use `""""""` with f string to be on the safe side"
1834,2019-04-24T08:29:59.472400,Christina,oic. Is it aways recommend? seems excessive in some cases.
1834,2019-04-24T08:30:57.473100,Jimmy,I don't think pep8 says anything regarding that. I now use black for new projects and it does that. I like it
1834,2019-04-24T08:34:59.473900,Christina,PEP8 was also written before interpolation was proposed :stuck_out_tongue: but pep-0498 doesn't seem to include anything regarding style guidelines

1838,2019-04-24T11:16:27.491300,Jonas,and imagine you can only see one line of the list at a time
1838,2019-04-24T11:16:33.491700,Jonas,"conceptually, how would you do this"
1838,2019-04-24T11:16:59.492000,Jeannine,"if line.split(',') is int"
1838,2019-04-24T11:17:38.492800,Jeannine,except that does not work in that some of these categories cannot be listed in (they are greyed out on the spreadsheet because they have child categories)
1838,2019-04-24T11:18:08.493100,Jeannine,(i've pruned the id's off the end to help me view it better)
1838,2019-04-24T11:19:23.494000,Wilber,for starters you can use a csv reader to access the individual fields - <https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/csv.html>
1838,2019-04-24T11:20:16.495200,Jeannine,"<@Wilber> yep doing that already, its the knowing when to make a list or when to append"
1838,2019-04-24T11:21:20.496600,Wilber,from the example you posted it seems like that could just be determined by the presence or absence of a second item in a row?
1838,2019-04-24T11:23:16.497500,Christina,"&gt;except that does not work in that some of these categories cannot be listed in

What do you mean by listed in?"
1838,2019-04-24T11:23:45.498600,Jeannine,these are the categories we can make products in on amazon
1838,2019-04-24T11:23:58.499100,Jeannine,"if a category has child categories, it cannot be listed into"
1838,2019-04-24T11:24:14.499800,Jeannine,you have to get the the end of the 'tree' before you can choose the category
1838,2019-04-24T11:24:24.000300,Christina,"so if you want to check whether to make a list simply do:
```if 'accessories' in foo['bass guitars']:
    foo['bass guitars'].append(value)
else:
  foo['bass guitars'] = [value]```"
1838,2019-04-24T11:25:10.001900,Jeannine,"<@Christina> correct, except the next line in the csv file may state that there are child categories and so this needs to be a list, not the final data"
1838,2019-04-24T11:25:46.003100,Jonas,it doesn't matter
1838,2019-04-24T11:25:51.003400,Jonas,if the csv is well formed
1838,2019-04-24T11:26:06.003900,Jonas,which we can assume it is
1838,2019-04-24T11:26:14.004200,Christina,"oh so the lowest level is a dict, but all the others are lists?. why would you have that? in your example, the list only has one entry, a dict with the key being the child"
1838,2019-04-24T11:27:14.005800,Jeannine,sorry thought I had
1838,2019-04-24T11:27:26.006500,Christina,it's fine. i collapsed it :stuck_out_tongue:

1849,2019-04-25T12:14:42.056500,Leida,ah man it duplicates for each exception
1849,2019-04-25T12:14:51.056800,Leida,so the any was smart in the stack solution
1849,2019-04-25T12:20:38.057600,Clemmie,`[url for url in website_list if url not in exception_list]`
1849,2019-04-25T12:22:07.058300,Leida,this wont do string comparison will it?
1849,2019-04-25T12:22:25.058700,Leida,if the string is partial of the full url
1849,2019-04-25T12:24:04.060000,Clemmie,"oh, no, if it is a partial you would want to make a method that takes the string and runs it through your str compare and returns true/false then do `[url for url in website_list if good_domain(url)]`"
1849,2019-04-25T12:50:40.061400,Leida,```[url for url in website_list if not any(True for ex in ex_list if ex in url)]``` - i was sure there was a single liner there somewhere. In reality tho do what misthop said. Being clever doesnt mean good code.

1853,2019-04-25T15:27:05.066500,Sasha,I'd start with a couple of utility routines which can identify the indent level of a line and whether the text is all-caps or not.
1853,2019-04-25T15:39:19.068500,Sasha,"Oh, okay, so the INTER TEXT is just identified by being the first line of a text block?"
1854,2019-04-25T17:53:36.070900,Clayton,Do 'name collisions' occur in Jupyter / Colab notebooks ? Specifically  in naming the notebook and importing packages ?
1855,2019-04-25T18:12:33.071500,Bethany,Like if the notebook is named `numpy.ipynb`?
1855,2019-04-25T18:18:32.072900,Clayton,"yes.  and also if a file is uploaded to the Colab VM, or a local Jupyter server."
1855,2019-04-25T18:19:04.073400,Bethany,I'd be surprised if that was a problem but I suppose it's possible
1856,2019-04-25T19:30:06.074400,Maricruz,Nope.
1857,2019-04-25T19:53:54.078200,Priscilla,"I need to take a bunch of functions (A, B, C...) and perform them sequentially according to some kind of index. so it goes Unit1: A, B, C... then Unit2: A, B, C... and so on for however many Units there are. :thinking_face: what is it I am looking for? is there a concept that this falls into?"
1857,2019-04-25T20:01:57.079600,Sasha,"The Unit sequence would be well-represented by a `map()`. The A, B, C sequence is less common, but you can do that with a loop:
```for func in [A, B, C]:
  value = func(value)```"
1857,2019-04-25T20:07:43.079900,Priscilla,"what do you mean by ""The A, B, C sequence is less common""?"
1857,2019-04-25T20:09:05.081000,Sasha,"Just that it's more usual to want to iterate over data than iterate over functions, so I don't think there's a Python built-in for applying a list of functions to a value, like there is for applying a function to a list of data."
1857,2019-04-25T20:09:38.081400,Sasha,But you can just do it easily in a loop as above.
1857,2019-04-25T20:09:43.081500,Priscilla,oh i see!

1859,2019-04-25T21:18:55.088200,Eliana,You’ll need a windows computer. In a pinch a VM may do the trick. You’ll still need to get hands on an ISO.

1863,2019-04-26T05:18:10.103900,Ermelinda,Hello. What could be the reason that PyCharm doesn't see Faker here?
1863,2019-04-26T05:23:32.104200,Ermelinda,It should be:
1863,2019-04-26T05:23:36.104400,Ermelinda,from faker import Faker
1864,2019-04-26T06:06:44.105000,Leida,add an __init__.py file
1864,2019-04-26T06:08:03.105400,Leida,into `Faker` that is
1864,2019-04-26T07:34:37.106900,Leida,em sort of
1864,2019-04-26T07:37:59.108300,Leida,"actually, seems fine"
1864,2019-04-26T07:38:04.108500,Leida,got any errors with it?
1864,2019-04-26T07:38:56.108800,Leida,only the split is odd
1864,2019-04-26T07:39:46.109700,Leida,"`split()` splits on whitespace on default and args are also split by whitespace, so i dont see how you can further split `sys.argv[1]`"
1864,2019-04-26T07:40:18.110300,Leida,and then rejoining it again?
1864,2019-04-26T07:40:28.110600,Arturo,yeah its really annoying
1864,2019-04-26T07:40:33.111000,Leida,what is the goal?
1864,2019-04-26T07:41:43.112800,Arturo,we have to use this in built tool at our work (don't get me started on this will save that for job advice :angry: ) and it does not have `split` or `join` methods. So we are able to create an executable python script and then run that
1864,2019-04-26T07:42:31.114000,Arturo,"I pass a string like so;

```
a = 'LST ABC'
```
and want to get back;

```
result = 'lstabc'
```"
1864,2019-04-26T07:42:48.114500,Leida,ok but right now you return `lst`
1864,2019-04-26T07:42:55.115000,Arturo,ah ok
1864,2019-04-26T07:43:09.115300,Leida,argv[1] = LST and argv[2]=ABC
1864,2019-04-26T07:43:31.115900,Leida,they are already split into argument variables list
1864,2019-04-26T07:43:51.116600,Leida,are there always 2 parts to add together?
1864,2019-04-26T07:44:08.117000,Arturo,"also I changed it to instead of returning the variable, to save to a text file but didn't seem to work;

```

    if len(sys.argv)&gt;1:

```"
1864,2019-04-26T07:44:16.117200,Arturo,yes always two parts
1864,2019-04-26T07:44:41.117600,Leida,the joined_mml is saving only the first part right?
1864,2019-04-26T07:44:52.117900,Arturo,I am not seeing anything saved
1864,2019-04-26T07:45:16.118500,Arturo,don't forget I am running the exe from this tool that I have to use which is really bad
1864,2019-04-26T07:45:25.118800,Arturo,so could be something to do with this
1864,2019-04-26T07:46:24.119600,Leida,"best practisse with writing to files is to use the `with` context manager, you arent closing the file right now"
1864,2019-04-26T07:47:34.119800,Arturo,cool will change
1864,2019-04-26T07:53:46.120700,Leida,you could give your function `sys.argv[1:]`
1864,2019-04-26T07:54:40.121400,Leida,that is - everything except the what is at `argv[0]` which is the script name
1864,2019-04-26T07:55:16.122200,Leida,and then you can do `joined_mml = ''.join(mml_cmd).lower()`
1864,2019-04-26T07:55:43.122600,Leida,this joins all the arguments that you gave the script and puts them lower case
1864,2019-04-26T07:56:02.122900,Leida,the split is not needed
1864,2019-04-26T07:58:46.123700,Leida,"```
with open(""path_to_file"", ""w"") as out_file:
    out_file.write(joined_mml)```"
1864,2019-04-26T07:59:56.124400,Leida,this opens the file and closes it down after you are done with it
1864,2019-04-26T08:19:09.126200,Leida,you wish to convert it to executable python or just want to read the internals?
1864,2019-04-26T08:19:27.126600,Leida,it seems to be text encoded so it works as any text file
1864,2019-04-26T08:22:12.127200,Peg,I need to read the file and modify some part of it using python
1864,2019-04-26T08:51:05.127900,Leida,"you will have to figure out by what you locate the data you wish to change, be it whitespace or keywords"
1865,2019-04-26T06:49:17.106100,Arturo,how to pass variable to an .exe py function?

1867,2019-04-26T09:37:20.133500,Claudine,i think that's probably the best way
1867,2019-04-26T09:37:42.134000,Claudine,you could also do it with :pray: regex :pray:  but that's a bit overkill

1870,2019-04-26T20:24:38.160500,Lory,my console then shows a couple if ipdb&gt; prompts but then returns to the console prompt

1870,2019-04-26T20:27:06.162100,Clayton,I think it would be an external terminal window from the environment that spyder was launched from
1870,2019-04-26T20:27:21.162400,Clayton,not the ipython console
1870,2019-04-26T20:28:25.163600,Clayton,View &gt;&gt; attach console window (debugging)

1870,2019-04-26T20:31:15.166100,Lory,usually (or sometimes from the Start menu)
1870,2019-04-26T20:31:29.166400,Clayton,I would just launch it from whatever env you are in via the terminal
1870,2019-04-26T20:32:01.166700,Clayton,you might always be in the base env
1870,2019-04-26T20:32:54.167600,Clayton,then you have to point it at the custom interpreter you want
1870,2019-04-26T20:33:05.168000,Lory,"OK, I found a relevant preference (trying to find it again)"
1870,2019-04-26T20:33:56.168900,Clayton,"if launched from a custom env, it uses that specific python install"
1870,2019-04-26T20:34:20.169600,Clayton,i would also install spyder-terminal inside spyder

1875,2019-04-26T21:50:22.179900,Lory,I'm looping through a list of items that meet a test of one of the attributes of the items:
1875,2019-04-26T21:50:36.180200,Lory,`        for a in (a for a in self.assignments if not a.validated):`
1875,2019-04-26T21:51:00.180700,Lory,but then later in the loop I'd like to change the attribute based on some other logic:
1875,2019-04-26T21:51:53.181500,Lory,"`            a.validated = True`
Will this cause problems with the loop, since I am modifying the iterator?"
1875,2019-04-26T22:00:02.182300,Sasha,"It should be okay, since you're not modifying the direct contents of `assignments`."

1875,2019-04-26T22:05:59.187800,Sasha,"You could also do:
```for a in filter(lambda x: not x.validated, self.assignments):```
But I tend to favor the `continue` for clarify even if it's more lines."
1875,2019-04-26T22:06:15.188000,Lory,"nod, thanks"
1875,2019-04-26T22:08:50.188500,Sasha,I wonder if Python has considered a `continue if x.validated` one-liner construct.

1877,2019-04-27T03:48:41.198900,Jimmy,There is whole talk somewhere about validating email. The conclusion was just send an email with a validation link it's way easier
1878,2019-04-27T04:06:06.199200,Jettie,"writing good documentation is hard, but having documentation at all is still a blessing :)

I'd say you need to have a quickstart section for the most common use-case, and then a section where you descibe advanced usage with lots of examples. Everything else depends of what the product is"
1879,2019-04-27T10:45:07.200300,Carmen,"Yes, that's what I meant."
1879,2019-04-27T10:45:42.200500,Carmen,"Typically, when people are putting in an options object to hold configuration values, they'll name it `opt`. That's a regular and understandable abbreviation variable name."
1879,2019-04-27T10:47:51.200700,Carmen,"So without any other information than the line of code in question, we're assigning a local variable to the value of a member (with the exact same name) of an object that happens to conform to a standard options object naming convention. It seems reasonable that `opt` is supposed to be an options object, and there's just some code copying that occurred from someone who wasn't paying attention."
1880,2019-04-27T12:57:53.201400,Clayton,Shouldnt there be some code that actually shows how the original developer actually imported / instantiated an 'opt' object ?

1883,2019-04-27T18:22:13.224300,Priscilla,"What is the best way to store data like this within a program? The number of devices is determined by input from operator. So the operator will input the number of devices, then assign a serial number to each one, then iterate through some tests for each one. What is the best course to hold this information while it processes? list? cant be a dictionary because a dictionary has only 1 value to a key right?"
1883,2019-04-27T18:24:05.225000,Sasha,"Yes, though that value can be arbitrary: a list, another dict, a class, etc."
1883,2019-04-27T18:25:27.226100,Priscilla,"a dictionary can hold a list as a value huh? so i could let the key be a device serial number, and the value be a list of true or false for pass/fail right?"
1883,2019-04-27T18:26:24.227200,Priscilla,or just pass/fail strings i guess..
1883,2019-04-27T18:26:47.227700,Sasha,"Yep, you sure can. That's a reasonable solution, though there are plenty of other options, like making a class to hold each device's data."
1883,2019-04-27T18:27:15.227800,Frankie,Alright - who wants to attack this one? lol

1883,2019-04-27T18:46:20.231900,Carmen,You could also just try using the S3 CLI with those credentials to verify that it can do it's thing.
1883,2019-04-27T18:46:38.232500,Frankie,I've verified the latter - it works locally
1883,2019-04-27T18:46:48.233100,Frankie,this is once it tries to run the command from the EC2 instance
1883,2019-04-27T18:46:51.233400,Frankie,on deploy
1883,2019-04-27T18:47:42.234200,Carmen,Does your EC2 instance have the API permissions in the environment when it's executing the transfer?
1883,2019-04-27T18:47:47.234400,Carmen,*API credentials
1883,2019-04-27T18:48:04.234800,Frankie,well it has the AWS access key and secret key in the environment variables if that's what you mean
1883,2019-04-27T18:49:20.236100,Frankie,"and FWIW, it can put static files in the elastic beanstalk bucket whenthe container commands run collectstatic just before this, so I know that the user running manage.py collectstatic has access to the EB bucket...which is why I tried a derivation of those permissions on the new bucket I created"
1883,2019-04-27T18:51:44.236600,Frankie,"also, there's no CORS config or ACL on that bucket...it's just a bucket policy"
1883,2019-04-27T18:59:41.237300,Bethany,use an IAM role on the ec2 instance
1883,2019-04-27T18:59:54.238000,Bethany,with permissions to upload to the s3 bucket
1883,2019-04-27T18:59:57.238100,Carmen,Maybe try temporarily switching the collectstatic command to point at your new bucket and see if it can upload.
1883,2019-04-27T19:03:34.239400,Frankie,"<@Carmen> that would risk a bunch of other annoying potential problems so I don't want to do that. <@Bethany> I was trying to use the same role that was created along w/ all the other elastic beanstalk magic, but I might be using it wrong or not using it at all"
1883,2019-04-27T19:04:11.239700,Frankie,though I think I might have found a potential reason it's not working.
1883,2019-04-27T19:06:03.242300,Frankie,"it was deployed with elastic beanstalk, so it creates a load balancer, API gateway, security groups, EC2 instances, etc all automatically"

1883,2019-04-27T19:06:36.243300,Frankie,"no, but similar to that concept"
1883,2019-04-27T19:06:52.243600,Bethany,can you do something like the following
1883,2019-04-27T19:08:26.243700,Bethany,None
1883,2019-04-27T19:08:35.244200,Bethany,that's psuedo config style I just invented
1883,2019-04-27T19:11:18.244800,Frankie,one sec...I have an idea.
1883,2019-04-27T19:18:26.247200,Bethany,"you can manually test the iam part, the updates happen ""instantly"""
1883,2019-04-27T19:18:34.247800,Frankie,the EC2 role I'm assigning looks like it allows acces to buckets prepended with `elasticbeanstalk-` so I added that to the front of my bucket name
1883,2019-04-27T19:18:35.247900,Bethany,even to a live instanfe
1883,2019-04-27T19:18:47.248400,Bethany,that could do it
1883,2019-04-27T19:19:02.248700,Frankie,we'll know in about 30 seconds lol
1883,2019-04-27T19:20:40.249800,Frankie,:rage: #fail

1883,2019-04-27T19:21:05.250600,Frankie,been fighting with this for liek 3 hours
1883,2019-04-27T19:21:13.250900,Clayton,Why is that ?
1883,2019-04-27T19:21:18.251100,Frankie,computer is about to take a trip over the balcony lol
1883,2019-04-27T19:21:52.251700,Frankie,<@Bethany> fwiw my permissions on the bucket look nearly identical to what you just suggested
1883,2019-04-27T19:21:58.251900,Frankie,but obv w/ real code lol
1883,2019-04-27T19:22:11.252100,Bethany,you
1883,2019-04-27T19:22:19.252500,Bethany,you're getting accessdenied again?

1883,2019-04-27T19:29:34.256200,Frankie,all I did was remove the middle statement cause I don't need any read/list access...all I want to do is be able to stuff a damn CSV file into it
1883,2019-04-27T19:30:21.256400,Bethany,hm yeah Idk
1883,2019-04-27T19:30:43.256700,Frankie,I think I'm gonna try smashing my face into the keyboard and see if that helps.
1883,2019-04-27T19:30:49.256900,Bethany,it might
1883,2019-04-27T19:31:39.257500,Frankie,it's annoying cause I know it works cause I can run the command locally here on my machine and push a file up to it w/ no problem even w/o a bucket policy or anything
1883,2019-04-27T19:31:50.257900,Frankie,so it's def some hidden AWS crap causing the problem.
1883,2019-04-27T19:32:13.258300,Bethany,can you inspect the instance after its provisioned to see it's access policies
1883,2019-04-27T19:32:30.258600,Frankie,hmmm I hadn't tried that but yeah I'll look at the instance itself.
1883,2019-04-27T19:32:36.258900,Frankie,maybe it's using something I haven't seen in the roles
1883,2019-04-27T19:34:32.259500,Frankie,"as a side note, any idea how I can at least run the command on the EC2 instance itself from the command line soI don't have to keep redeploying?"
1883,2019-04-27T19:35:09.260200,Frankie,it seems just running `python manage.py export_user_data` after activating the env and stuff can't create the file on the EC2 instance
1883,2019-04-27T19:35:29.260700,Frankie,it creates the file when using the container command but I can't do it manually and when I use sudo it gives me a syntax error. lol
1883,2019-04-27T19:36:10.261000,Bethany,yeeah you can ssh into i2
1883,2019-04-27T19:36:11.261200,Bethany,it

1883,2019-04-27T19:37:23.262800,Frankie,permission denied lol
1883,2019-04-27T19:37:23.262900,Bethany,this might be a django thing and I'll be no help there
1883,2019-04-27T19:37:42.263100,Bethany,is the csv a local file?
1883,2019-04-27T19:37:56.263500,Frankie,"the export command is supposed to create it locally, yes"
1883,2019-04-27T19:38:19.264100,Frankie,"basically I want to create the CSV on the EC2 instance, push it to S3, then delete it from EC2"
1883,2019-04-27T19:38:28.264300,Frankie,every time I deploy
1883,2019-04-27T19:39:13.265200,Frankie,"it works to create it on deployment, but won't push to S3...but when I just try to run the command on the EC2 instance, it won't create the damn file and if I sudo it gives me a syntax error. I'm bout to lose it. lol"
1883,2019-04-27T19:39:51.265900,Frankie,"so at best all I can do right now is redeploy repeatedly to test it, which is annoying cause it takes like 4 minutes to redeploy just to see it fail so it's taking forever to debug it"
1883,2019-04-27T19:40:16.266500,Bethany,"so you provision the thing, then push some data from it to s3? But where does the data come from originally?"
1883,2019-04-27T19:40:30.266800,Frankie,the database connected to the thing :slightly_smiling_face:
1883,2019-04-27T19:40:52.267300,Bethany,ok so its db -&gt; django on ec2 -&gt; s3?
1883,2019-04-27T19:41:02.267500,Frankie,yes
1883,2019-04-27T19:41:53.268600,Frankie,I guess really it's more like push code to ec2 -&gt; query RDS (database) -&gt; generate csv on ec2 -&gt; push csv to S3 -&gt; delete csv from EC2
1883,2019-04-27T19:42:11.268900,Bethany,"the ec2 stays around afterwards, right?"
1883,2019-04-27T19:43:30.270300,Priscilla,I cant seem to figure out how to populate a dictionary with a user-determined number of keys. nothing i try works :facepalm:
1883,2019-04-27T19:43:56.270900,Frankie,"actually, the EC2 instance will not stick around afterwards"
1883,2019-04-27T19:44:15.271400,Frankie,once the code is deployed successfully it will be replaced by the load balancer
1883,2019-04-27T19:44:35.271900,Frankie,that's why I don't just want to store the csv on EC2...its ephemeral
1883,2019-04-27T19:44:40.272100,Bethany,<@Priscilla> what did you try to do?
1883,2019-04-27T19:45:10.272800,Bethany,ok I'm a bit confused. Once deployed the ec2 gets undeployed or does it get put behin ELB with other instances?
1883,2019-04-27T19:50:15.273900,Priscilla,hangon... trying one more thing that just came to mind
1883,2019-04-27T19:51:45.274900,Hiroko,<@Frankie> the issue seems to be the file doesn't have the necessary system permissions for the management command to access 
1883,2019-04-27T19:51:55.275300,Hiroko,That's what the stack trace is telling you with the permission denied bit 
1883,2019-04-27T19:52:54.276700,Hiroko,"So what perms are attached to the file, and what user:group?"
1883,2019-04-27T19:56:30.279300,Frankie,"<@Bethany> so basically what happens is that when I deploy from my local machine, it uploads a zip file to S3...there is an SQS queue listening for that upload (all this is configured by elastic beanstalk btw), when the SQS queue sees the upload, it first (I think) clones the existing instance to maintain uptime, disconnects the EC2 instance from the load balancer, deploys the new app version, and then reattaches it. when it reattaches it after a successful deployment it will have a new IP. then it terminates the cloned instance"
1883,2019-04-27T19:57:06.280100,Frankie,"assuming you just have a single instance system. How the load balancer is configured determines how many it'll allow to be running at once, but I just have it allow only two (one for prod and one for staging)"
1883,2019-04-27T19:57:55.280300,Priscilla,"nope, nothing I try works and this is the only thing I think is close. I tried googling, but found nothing relevant. I am shooting blind here, I don't really know how to implement what i want to do :angry:"
1883,2019-04-27T19:58:54.281300,Frankie,<@Hiroko> looks like the perms on the directory I'm trying to create the file in are 755
1883,2019-04-27T19:59:11.282000,Hiroko,<@Priscilla> you're returning something from the number function but not using it anywhere 
1883,2019-04-27T19:59:24.282500,Hiroko,"Eg, no variable in main to store the return value "
1883,2019-04-27T20:00:11.283000,Bethany,<@Priscilla> do you want to keep prompting for input and put the result in a dictionary?
1883,2019-04-27T20:01:57.284900,Bethany,"what is the key and what is the value. do you want `my_dict = {""user_first_input"": ????}` or `my_dict = {??????? : ""user_first_input""}` and what do you want the  ????? to be"
1883,2019-04-27T20:03:16.285600,Priscilla,"i would like the user input to the key, because the key is a serial number, and the values will be a list."
1883,2019-04-27T20:03:29.286100,Bethany,and you're storing that list somewhere?
1883,2019-04-27T20:03:59.286600,Priscilla,yes
1883,2019-04-27T20:04:07.286900,Bethany,Ok so you probably have something like:
1883,2019-04-27T20:04:55.287000,Bethany,None
1883,2019-04-27T20:05:18.287700,Priscilla,thats right!
1883,2019-04-27T20:05:19.287900,Bethany,and you want them to pick a list via serial number? Or create this
1883,2019-04-27T20:06:05.288500,Priscilla,no it will go straight to a CSV with one exception
1883,2019-04-27T20:06:46.289300,Priscilla,"no wait, I mean it will all be presented to the user, not picked via a serial number"
1883,2019-04-27T20:06:57.289600,Hiroko,"<@Frankie> no, what I mean is this:

```line 41, in handle
    with open(filename, 'w') as csv:
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'ACTIVE_USERS_20190427_233356.csv'```"
1883,2019-04-27T20:07:03.289900,Hiroko,that’s in your management command
1883,2019-04-27T20:07:12.290300,Hiroko,its trying to open a file it doesn’t have perms for
1883,2019-04-27T20:07:54.291500,Bethany,"<@Priscilla> I'm not quite sure what it is the user is expected to do here. But if you have a dictionary, you can add a key:value pair by simply `d[new_key] = new_value`"
1883,2019-04-27T20:08:32.292600,Frankie,<@Hiroko> it's trying to open it with WRITE permissions. the file doesn't exist. the code's trying to create it.
1883,2019-04-27T20:08:41.293000,Hiroko,correct
1883,2019-04-27T20:09:01.293800,Hiroko,which suggests the user:group of the process running the command doesn’t have access to that directory
1883,2019-04-27T20:09:16.294600,Frankie,I agree lol
1883,2019-04-27T20:09:29.295200,Frankie,I don't know what that process is though
1883,2019-04-27T20:09:30.295300,Hiroko,"if you ssh into the instance, with the same group, are you able to `touch some_file.txt` in that directory?"
1883,2019-04-27T20:10:34.296800,Frankie,"yes, if I sudo, but if I sudo as you can see it gives me a syntax error"
1883,2019-04-27T20:13:13.297900,Priscilla,"i know, im sorry <@Bethany> let me explain entirely. The user will input some serial numbers (corresponding to connected devices) but there is no set number, they will connect anywhere from 1-10 devices. Each device will run through some tests and pass or fail and at the end I need to display this:"
1883,2019-04-27T20:13:40.299100,Bethany,oh ok and that is saved to csv as a report or something
1883,2019-04-27T20:13:46.299400,Priscilla,right
1883,2019-04-27T20:13:46.299500,Hiroko,then I would suggest you change things so you don’t have to run that command with `sudo`
1883,2019-04-27T20:14:10.300200,Frankie,that's not the issue.
1883,2019-04-27T20:14:16.300500,Bethany,"so it sounds to me you don't actually need a dictionary to store the user input, you could use a list or set"
1883,2019-04-27T20:14:20.300700,Frankie,the command runs fine when I deploy the code because the deploy script runs as root
1883,2019-04-27T20:15:13.302300,Frankie,I was just trying to run it locally on EC2 so I didn't have to keep redeploying cause it saves me waiting for 4 damn minutes just to test changing bucket policies 50 times in a row lol
1883,2019-04-27T20:15:49.303000,Priscilla,"yes, but the data does need to be ordered, like explicitly in that order `serialnumber, [test1], [test2], [test3]` arent sets unordered?"
1883,2019-04-27T20:16:31.303400,Carmen,"A set is unordered, yes."
1883,2019-04-27T20:18:30.303800,Frankie,<@Priscilla> `from collections import OrderedDict` ftw!
1883,2019-04-27T20:19:20.304800,Hiroko,"well, if you’re using python 3.6+, dicts are ordered by insertion"
1883,2019-04-27T20:19:34.305400,Hiroko,"3.6 made it an implementation detail, 3.7 finalized it in the spec"
1883,2019-04-27T20:20:03.305700,Bethany,"if you need no duplicates but order doesn't matter, `Set`, if you need duplicates and order matters, `list`"
1883,2019-04-27T20:20:18.306000,Bethany,<@Hiroko> i thought that was a Cpython implementation detai
1883,2019-04-27T20:20:25.306100,Priscilla,None

1883,2019-04-27T20:20:29.306700,Bethany,but it's in the spec now?
1883,2019-04-27T20:20:33.306900,Hiroko,correct
1883,2019-04-27T20:20:46.307200,Bethany,oh cool. Still will probably not assume it though
1883,2019-04-27T20:21:03.307500,Hiroko,&gt;&gt;&gt;the insertion-order preservation nature of dict objects has been declared to be an official part of the Python language spec.

1883,2019-04-27T20:21:14.308200,Priscilla,ok so then lists it is
1883,2019-04-27T20:21:34.308900,Bethany,list is a good default choice anyway.
1883,2019-04-27T20:21:40.309100,Hiroko,"before, it was an implementation detail of cpython, which excludes pypy"
1883,2019-04-27T20:21:46.309400,Hiroko,"but now, its part of the spec"
1883,2019-04-27T20:21:53.309600,Priscilla,i think i understand lists a little better than the other options
1883,2019-04-27T20:23:43.310400,Frankie,Maybe I'm missing something cause I was half paying attention to your issue/goal <@Priscilla> but this seems kinda trivial to me...what is your goal for user input and what's the goal for output?
1883,2019-04-27T20:24:07.311000,Frankie,are serialnumber1-4 supposed to be entered by the user?
1883,2019-04-27T20:28:18.315800,Priscilla,"The goal for input is the serial number of a device then running some functions against it and getting back a pass or fail for each 3 set of functions. Then displaying the serial number and 3 test results to the user. Apparently they will do these devices in a single batch of 10. So the amount of devices (serial number and test results in this convo) may not be a definitive number, ya know?"
1883,2019-04-27T20:28:33.316000,Priscilla,does that make sense?

1883,2019-04-27T20:34:15.319400,Frankie,"meaning, can they continue entering indefinitely, or should it stop them after `n` serial numbers?"
1883,2019-04-27T20:35:28.319800,Priscilla,i am checking
1883,2019-04-27T20:36:23.320500,Priscilla,stop them after 10. No more than 10 can be used on the station right now.
1883,2019-04-27T20:38:04.320900,Frankie,are serial numbers always numbers or can they have letters/chars too?

1883,2019-04-27T21:12:40.349000,Carmen,"And they're operating on the OS level. So if you get a malicious barcode, it can do things like ""[CMD] + R [newline] cmd.exe [newline] [arbitrary commands here]"""

1883,2019-04-27T21:13:15.350100,Carmen,The computer has no idea you want to restrict the input to the active window. It'll let you switch windows with control keys and do anything you could do with a normal keyboard.
1883,2019-04-27T21:13:17.350200,Priscilla,well is that really a threat with barcodes that we print on there?

1883,2019-04-27T21:13:50.351200,Priscilla,i mean we make the barcodes.

1883,2019-04-27T21:14:24.352200,Priscilla,good point
1883,2019-04-27T21:15:10.352900,Carmen,"Though it's worth noting that just as it opens you up to risk, you can also take advantage of that to run very complicated strings of commands/actions from a single barcode scan."
1883,2019-04-27T21:15:17.353100,Carmen,If needed for some reason.
1883,2019-04-27T21:19:31.353600,Frankie,does anyone familiar with AWS know what the difference is between a Role ARN and an Instance Policy ARN?

1890,2019-04-27T21:34:26.364100,Rodrick,nvm
1890,2019-04-27T21:34:35.364400,Rodrick,Ok thanks
1890,2019-04-27T21:34:41.364600,Frankie,"btw, don't use `list` as a list name"
1890,2019-04-27T21:34:54.365100,Rodrick,im not
1890,2019-04-27T21:34:59.365300,Rodrick,just as an example
1890,2019-04-27T21:35:06.365600,Frankie,just making sure :slightly_smiling_face:
1890,2019-04-27T21:35:10.365800,Rodrick,thanks
1890,2019-04-27T21:46:49.367200,Rodrick,what does `pass` do in python
1890,2019-04-27T21:48:24.367500,Frankie,it does nothing :slightly_smiling_face:
1890,2019-04-27T21:49:13.369400,Hiroko,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9483979/is-there-a-difference-between-continue-and-pass-in-a-for-loop-in-python>
1890,2019-04-27T21:49:17.369600,Rodrick,like that
1890,2019-04-27T21:49:29.370100,Frankie,"that basically says ""always do nothing"""
1890,2019-04-27T21:50:06.372000,Frankie,usually `pass` is used if you just want to create a thing but don't know what you want it to do yet.
1890,2019-04-27T21:50:08.372200,Sasha,"The way I've heard it, `pass` is a blank line for places where a blank line isn't syntactically allowed."
1890,2019-04-27T21:50:17.372500,Hiroko,one thing its handy for is if you’re making a parent class with method implementations that will come from the subclasses
1890,2019-04-27T21:50:33.373200,Frankie,"e.g.
```
def some_function():
    # todo: write this function later
    pass
```"
1890,2019-04-27T21:50:33.373300,Hiroko,so you have a choice of using `pass` or raising `NotImplementedError`
1890,2019-04-27T21:51:25.374100,Priscilla,and every scan it pops up an new one
1890,2019-04-27T21:51:49.375100,Frankie,to indent/enter new lines in your output

1890,2019-04-27T21:54:42.378300,Priscilla,"i dipped my toe once, i really want to but I dont think i have time to figure that out"
1890,2019-04-27T21:55:30.379300,Priscilla,i guess I could just make a simple form with tkinter
1890,2019-04-27T21:57:23.382400,Sasha,Yes. Python is going to give the `self` parameter to your function whether you want it or not.
1890,2019-04-27T21:57:36.382700,Rodrick,ok
1890,2019-04-27T21:58:29.383600,Sasha,(This is only for regular method functions defined inside a class. Bare functions by themselves don't have a `self`.)
1890,2019-04-27T21:59:19.384000,Rodrick,Ok
1890,2019-04-27T22:00:17.384800,Sasha,"Note that if a method doesn't make use of `self`, you may want to consider whether it should be part of the class at all, or perhaps some other type of function."

1890,2019-04-27T22:14:35.389200,Sasha,"No special syntax, just `import argparse` if you use argparse in your library."

1891,2019-04-27T21:48:44.368200,Rodrick,so like if im in an `if` statment
1891,2019-04-27T21:48:58.368800,Rodrick,and its like
1891,2019-04-27T21:49:11.368900,Rodrick,None
1891,2019-04-27T21:49:24.369900,Rodrick,oh thanks jason
1891,2019-04-27T21:49:45.370600,Rodrick,i see
1891,2019-04-27T21:50:59.373500,Priscilla,is there a way to like stylize a command line program? it would be nice to return a serial number like in real time down a list like:
1891,2019-04-27T21:51:41.374700,Frankie,you could use escape characters like `\n` and `\t`
1891,2019-04-27T21:52:04.375500,Hiroko,"also, handling exceptions"
1891,2019-04-27T21:56:15.380600,Rodrick,for a class in a definition `def myDefinition(parm)`
1891,2019-04-27T21:56:22.381100,Priscilla,until now I was using just colorama for readability but i cant achieve that format with it of course
1891,2019-04-27T21:56:31.381400,Rodrick,do i need a `self` parm
1891,2019-04-27T21:56:38.381700,Rodrick,if im not using it?
1892,2019-04-27T22:12:15.388700,Clayton,Whats the syntax for that ?
1892,2019-04-27T22:36:09.389500,Frankie,I'm beginning to think my csv export to S3 is just not meant to be
1892,2019-04-27T22:36:10.389700,Frankie,lol

1892,2019-04-27T22:42:08.392200,Clayton,Did you know that 'S3'  stands for 'Simple Storage Solution  ?  S3 sounds like its some kind of real complex technology
1892,2019-04-27T22:42:56.392400,Frankie,hahaha
1892,2019-04-27T22:43:09.392700,Frankie,Same as most AWS services
1892,2019-04-27T22:43:27.393200,Priscilla,lol

1892,2019-04-27T22:44:49.394900,Frankie,I've tried everything I can think of and I'm lost lol
1892,2019-04-27T22:44:53.395100,Frankie,oh well
1892,2019-04-27T22:45:00.395400,Frankie,guess I'll figure it out eventually.
1892,2019-04-27T22:47:59.396000,Clayton,"Mybe try Azure, GCP, IBM, Oracle"
1892,2019-04-27T22:49:42.396400,Frankie,haha
1892,2019-04-27T22:49:55.396700,Frankie,I actually really like AWS honestly
1892,2019-04-27T22:50:05.397000,Frankie,I just don't like not being able to figure things out :smile:
1892,2019-04-27T22:50:34.397600,Frankie,esp since the whole reason for this in the first place actually isn't even to get the file into S3 ... it's just an interim step I got distratced by and like 9 hours later here I am haha
1892,2019-04-27T22:52:26.397800,Frankie,I'm trying ooooone more thing here
1892,2019-04-27T22:54:17.398300,Frankie,didn't work :cry: lol
1892,2019-04-27T22:54:33.398800,Frankie,but yea you're right - I already know it's impossible for me to stop at this point
1892,2019-04-27T22:54:37.399000,Frankie,I have to figure it out
1892,2019-04-27T23:01:37.399800,Priscilla,You should just move on to a work around. You know you will figure it out later. 
1892,2019-04-27T23:04:39.400400,Frankie,"the workaround is basically ""do it manually"" which is the whole hting I'm trying to avoid lol"
1892,2019-04-27T23:06:20.402200,Frankie,"I was just trying to set up an automated DB export of active users, customers and subscriptions to CSV so I could then import the users into mailchimp to build my list the first time, but in doing it I figured it'd be nice to just auto-export a copy of everything each time I deploy so I can always jump into S3 and get an updated view of my users, customers, etc"
1892,2019-04-28T00:38:02.402400,Frankie,finally figured it out
1892,2019-04-28T13:01:23.403800,Clayton,Mornin'
1892,2019-04-28T13:06:22.404300,Priscilla,i too would like to know what fixed it <@Frankie>
1892,2019-04-28T13:37:13.405100,Frankie,<@Bethany> <@Priscilla> well I don't know if this is right but basically What I ended up doing was assigning the bucket policy to the same user that manages my static files
1892,2019-04-28T13:37:21.405400,Frankie,instead of assigning it to the role of the EC2 instance
1892,2019-04-28T13:38:07.406300,Frankie,I actually even tried creating a new user specifically for managing this bucket but it seems the `boto` library that interfaces w/ the AWS API needs some extra stuff it's not telling you about in terms of permissions
1892,2019-04-28T13:38:27.406800,Frankie,"e.g. it might need to read the ACL of the bucket in order to determine if it's allowed to put stuff in it, or whatever ..."
1892,2019-04-28T13:39:08.407900,Priscilla,"neat, i think i get it. nice job! :smile:"
1892,2019-04-28T13:39:21.408200,Frankie,"so the static files user has a bunch more permissions but applying the bucket policy to it strips its permissions down to just `PutObject` and `PutObjectAcl`, along with whatever other stuff it (apparently) needs"
1892,2019-04-28T13:40:30.409700,Frankie,I tried to get a file from the bucket w/ that user and tried changing the ACL and stuff like that and it denied me which is what I wanted but it is definitely annoying that I don't actually know what permissions it needs and just have to trust that the developer assigned ones that are safe for what I want. Unfortunately the only way to know for sure would be for me to dig into the source of `boto` but tbh I don't care that much lol
1892,2019-04-28T13:41:40.410300,Priscilla,lol
1892,2019-04-28T13:56:14.410600,Frankie,did you get your dictionary thing figured out? <@Priscilla>
1892,2019-04-28T13:57:19.412000,Frankie,what part are you working on?
1892,2019-04-28T13:57:52.413000,Frankie,I had the rest of it sort of figured out in my head but just needed some more info on how you planned to structure things
1892,2019-04-28T13:58:40.414300,Priscilla,"id like each serial number to have its own list, so the only information in each list pertains to that instrument"
1892,2019-04-28T13:59:25.415300,Chester,<@Alicia> what problem you're trying to solve?
1892,2019-04-28T14:00:03.415400,Alicia,"the problem is related to this stackoverflow issue

<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21784641/installation-issue-with-matplotlib-python>"
1892,2019-04-28T14:00:13.415800,Frankie,yea that's pretty simple
1892,2019-04-28T14:00:36.416300,Frankie,<@Priscilla> so you need to iterate through the list of serials and create an empty list as the value of that key in a dict
1892,2019-04-28T14:00:49.416700,Chester,I'm not sure how
1892,2019-04-28T14:01:08.417200,Alicia,"In my package at the moment I simply solve this running this code in the __init__ files:

```
# This piece of code is needed to fix a bug in matplotlib on MacOs
# see: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21784641/installation-issue-with-matplotlib-python> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
if sys.platform == 'darwin':
    p = pathlib.Path('~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc')
    try:
        with open(os.path.expanduser(p), ""w"", encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write('backend: TkAgg\n')
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        print('Something went wrong! You have to perform a manual fix.')
        print(""To Fix: Add the row 'backend: TkAgg' in the file '~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc'."")
else:
    print(""Detected the following system platform: {}."".format(sys.platform))
    print(""Not performing matplotlib fix."")
```"
1892,2019-04-28T14:01:41.417800,Alicia,but this really slowed down the package import phase somehow
1892,2019-04-28T14:03:19.419600,Frankie,"```
mydict = {}
mykeys = ['a', 'b', 'c']

mydict = { key: [] for key in mykeys } # Dictionary comprehension!

# or ... 

from collections import OrderedDict
mykeys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
myvals = [[], [], []]
# alternatively for myvals:
myvals = [[] for key in mykeys] # List comprehension: saves you from typing [], [], [], [] ......... forever
mydict = OrderedDict(zip(mykeys, myvals))
```"
1892,2019-04-28T14:03:23.419800,Chester,What about using this instead <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21784641/installation-issue-with-matplotlib-python#comment56913201_21789908>
1892,2019-04-28T14:03:25.420100,Frankie,lots of ways to do it
1892,2019-04-28T14:04:27.420900,Frankie,"I quite like the `OrderedDict(zip(keys, vals))` pattern cause it allows you to really see what the vals will be by putting them all in a list"
1892,2019-04-28T14:04:33.421100,Frankie,I use it a lot
1892,2019-04-28T14:06:11.421400,Chester,There's also `collections.defaultdict`
1892,2019-04-28T14:06:43.421600,Alicia,"mmm I will try that, maybe is better"
1892,2019-04-28T14:06:44.421800,Alicia,thanks
1892,2019-04-28T14:19:22.422500,Frankie,damn you person who registered for my site using your weird alphabet!
1892,2019-04-28T14:19:35.423000,Frankie,now I have to deal with stupid unicode lol
1892,2019-04-28T14:30:57.424300,Frankie,"does anyone have a preference for CSV files, whether they use tabs or commas as a delimiter?"
1892,2019-04-28T14:31:25.425300,Frankie,"commas seem annoying cause for field like location you could end up with stuff like `Los Angeles, CA` which throws off the columsn if you don't quote it."
1892,2019-04-28T14:31:38.425800,Frankie,"are tabs generally ""better"" to avoid this or should I just use quotes?"
1892,2019-04-28T14:32:41.426200,Clayton,"If you asked the average Python coder, would they know the difference between an 'expression' and 'statement'  ?"
1892,2019-04-28T14:33:12.426400,Frankie,Average? Probably not. lol
1892,2019-04-28T14:33:48.427000,Frankie,"I'd argue even a lot of advanced python coders wouldn't know the difference in terms of a strict definition, but probably understand the concept w/o realizing they do."
1892,2019-04-28T14:35:20.427800,Sasha,Personally I always go for tab-separated when I have a choice. Avoids all sorts of problems with escaping and quoting.
1892,2019-04-28T14:38:31.428000,Frankie,that's what I'm thinking too.
1892,2019-04-28T14:38:49.428400,Frankie,is there any risk of spaces being interpreted as tabs in freeform text fields?
1892,2019-04-28T14:39:16.429000,Frankie,"only one that's really being a pain is location cause it often has a comma, but I wouldn't put it past an end user to use a tab, for some reason, lol"
1892,2019-04-28T14:39:36.429300,Frankie,"so I'm thinking I should use tabs, and also quote the location field"
1892,2019-04-28T14:41:42.429900,Sasha,"If you're handling direct user input, it might be good practice to just do `replace('\t', ' ')` on everything to be safe."
1892,2019-04-28T14:41:58.430100,Frankie,ok.
1892,2019-04-28T14:42:17.430600,Frankie,it's just this one field so I think I'm just gonna do it in the CSV when I export cause the field isn't super important anyway
1892,2019-04-28T14:42:39.431000,Frankie,but if I wrap the field in quotes won't that prevent the inner tab from being interpreted anyway?
1892,2019-04-28T14:43:09.431900,Sasha,"Depends on the parser. If someone does `split('\t')`, then quotes are ignored."
1892,2019-04-28T14:43:32.432200,Frankie,"""someone"" as in another developer?"
1892,2019-04-28T14:46:04.434000,Sasha,"Yeah. It's not obvious whether tab-separated files should allow quotes like comma-separated ones do. I might purposefully use that when I want to have unbalanced quotes in my data, for instance. So it depends on what code consumes the file at the other end."
1892,2019-04-28T14:48:28.434200,Frankie,my eyeballs consume it :slightly_smiling_face:
1892,2019-04-28T14:49:12.435000,Sasha,"Heh, then do whatever you want. You're unlikely to be confused with the location field anyway."
1892,2019-04-28T14:49:18.435100,Frankie,but I think this should cover most cases...?
1892,2019-04-28T14:50:05.435700,Frankie,"(also, would just writing a newline be sufficient instead of 14 tabs? lol)"
1892,2019-04-28T14:50:52.436400,Sasha,"Your `replace` parameter is weird, BTW."
1892,2019-04-28T14:50:53.436500,Frankie,probably is no way a tab would ever end up in a username but it's the only other text field so may as well
1892,2019-04-28T14:51:31.436700,Frankie,"oh man, yeah you're right haha"
1892,2019-04-28T14:52:11.436900,Frankie,"`replace('\t', ' ')` like that?"
1892,2019-04-28T14:52:22.437200,Frankie,derp.
1892,2019-04-28T14:52:45.437500,Frankie,lol I don't even know what that is up there. What was I even writing? haha
1892,2019-04-28T14:53:50.438000,Frankie,did you happen to notice the question about just writing a newline in the except block?
1892,2019-04-28T14:54:17.438500,Sasha,It's not obvious what error you are guarding against in the `try` block. What do you expect to possibly go wrong?
1892,2019-04-28T14:54:38.438800,Frankie,well originally I was protecting against unicode errors
1892,2019-04-28T14:54:49.439100,Frankie,but I fixed that w/ encoding='utf-8' when opening the file
1892,2019-04-28T14:55:08.439600,Frankie,so now I'm just protecting against basically anything else that could possibly go wrong since an error in this function would prevent the deployment from completing.
1892,2019-04-28T14:55:46.440400,Frankie,and it's not critical that the CSV has EVERY user in it ... I'd be happy with 99% of them since any it misses on is probably not going to be a good user for me to market stuff to anyway since they most likely did something weird/wrong when registering
1892,2019-04-28T14:59:17.442300,Sasha,"Gotcha. I hesitate to suggest it, but if you're guarding against weird-data stuff like that, you might want the `try` at the start of the loop to potentially catch things like `date_joined` being `None` or whatever."
1892,2019-04-28T15:00:21.443000,Sasha,"With regard to newline versus a bunch of tabs, since only your eyes are consuming it, it doesn't matter, heh heh."
1892,2019-04-28T15:08:45.443400,Frankie,thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
1892,2019-04-28T15:09:11.443600,Frankie,it works :slightly_smiling_face:
1892,2019-04-28T15:09:25.444000,Frankie,it's so purdy heh
1892,2019-04-28T15:10:22.444500,Frankie,good point about the `None` thing btw - however that's an auto-generated field so it should never be `None`
1892,2019-04-28T15:11:04.445100,Frankie,and also I wouldn't want to prevent the whole CSV from being written just cause one user couldn't be written
1892,2019-04-28T15:11:40.445600,Sasha,"Right, I didn't mean outside of the loop, just at the start of the logic for each profile."
1892,2019-04-28T15:12:12.446000,Frankie,ahh right
1892,2019-04-28T15:12:13.446200,Frankie,ok.
1892,2019-04-28T15:12:18.446400,Frankie,might be a good idea
1892,2019-04-28T15:12:39.447100,Sasha,You also might consider logging an error message somewhere.
1892,2019-04-28T15:13:09.447600,Frankie,yeah. I mean it will be logged into the activity log on the server (that's where this print output came from)
1892,2019-04-28T15:13:36.448200,Frankie,it's not technically logging but any stdout stuff is maintained in the server's log file
1892,2019-04-28T15:14:20.449300,Frankie,so I can `tail -200 /var/log/eb-activity.log` to see stuff for example
1892,2019-04-28T15:14:33.449700,Sasha,Gotcha. But right now it just silently skips an invalid profile. You might want to print something if the `except` clause is triggered.
1892,2019-04-28T15:14:44.449900,Frankie,ohhh true good point
1892,2019-04-28T15:15:11.450500,Frankie,"that's much easier than what I did before which was log into the admin and findthe offending profile based on the ones above/below it, lol"
1892,2019-04-28T15:15:28.450900,Frankie,since they are organized in the CSV by date joined it was easy for me to find it but I like your way better
1892,2019-04-28T15:15:52.451100,Frankie,this can definitely be fine tuned now :slightly_smiling_face:
1892,2019-04-28T15:27:41.451400,Frankie,sweeeet 6561 users exported :open_mouth:
1892,2019-04-28T15:28:00.451800,Frankie,"I apologize in advance 6,561 times, but mailchimp here I come."

1893,2019-04-27T22:53:42.398100,Priscilla,9 hours? eh whats 1 more?
1894,2019-04-28T11:40:16.403300,Bethany,what fixed it
1895,2019-04-28T13:56:27.410900,Priscilla,not yet
1895,2019-04-28T13:58:22.414000,Alicia,"Hi everyone,
I have a strange question… there is a way to execute some python code if you import some module?
smthing like:
```
if iscalled('import matplotlib.pyplot' ):
    execute python code
```"

1896,2019-04-28T15:43:52.453800,Emelda,"From what I've seen, everything is very similar."
1897,2019-04-28T16:36:42.455200,Clayton,I would ask people in the user forums at <http://python.org|python.org> to start.

1897,2019-04-28T17:14:48.458000,Clayton,Does it have to with 'main' not being defined ?
1897,2019-04-28T17:23:14.458600,Maricruz,then I think the hotkey is something like crtl+shift+b
1897,2019-04-28T17:23:39.459200,Maricruz,I'd recommend just running code in command line/PowerShell though - more visibility

1898,2019-04-28T17:55:57.463900,Priscilla,or something along these lines maybe.
1898,2019-04-28T17:56:34.464600,Priscilla,this one thing is more of a pain in the ass than anticipated... im freaking out man
1898,2019-04-28T18:01:07.467400,Maricruz,"<@Priscilla> I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do, but I'd make a dictionary to hold the results from the test:

```
test_dict = {}

    test_dict[serial]['test_2_results'] = test2(serial)

1898,2019-04-28T18:10:29.468600,Priscilla,boy i am sick of typing serial numbers lol
1898,2019-04-28T18:11:37.469700,Maricruz,"for testing you should just do `serials = [312, 645, 879]` and comment out `serials = get_serials()` so you don't have to keep typing numbers."
1898,2019-04-28T18:11:39.469800,Priscilla,i took out the test1 and 3 because those dont exist yet
1898,2019-04-28T18:11:48.470000,Priscilla,omg your right
1898,2019-04-28T18:13:15.470900,Maricruz,that looks good to me...is that `test_dict` what you're wanting your end data to look like?
1898,2019-04-28T18:14:38.471400,Maricruz,"typo on line 12 btw, should be `'test2_results'`"
1898,2019-04-28T18:16:10.472100,Priscilla,where are those `None` coming from you think? should i just post it all?
1898,2019-04-28T18:17:53.472500,Maricruz,Ya just post it all - what's your `test_2` function returning?
1898,2019-04-28T18:18:18.472700,Priscilla,this is gonna hurt
1898,2019-04-28T18:18:35.472800,Priscilla,None
1898,2019-04-28T18:22:01.474400,Sasha,"Yeah, line 138: `out = print(report(serials))`. The return value of `print()` is `None`."
1898,2019-04-28T18:22:03.474500,Maricruz,"In the function `test_2`, you're not actually calling any of the sub functions"
1898,2019-04-28T18:22:19.474900,Maricruz,so `test_2` isn't going to return anything (i.e. it returns `None`
1898,2019-04-28T18:23:47.475600,Maricruz,"Oh nvm, I can't read"
1898,2019-04-28T18:24:10.476100,Sasha,"Line 131 isn't what you want either: `if oct_power_reset_flag and ocm1_power_reset_flag and relay1_temp_set == True:`... you're not calling the functions, just referencing the functions themselves."
1898,2019-04-28T18:24:20.476300,Maricruz,Right right ^^^
1898,2019-04-28T18:24:37.476600,Priscilla,working on it
1898,2019-04-28T18:26:27.476900,Priscilla,changed it

1898,2019-04-28T18:26:38.477300,Priscilla,holy
1898,2019-04-28T18:26:43.477500,Priscilla,shit it work\ed
1898,2019-04-28T18:33:14.478700,Priscilla,:face_with_monocle: is the `none` in outputs coming from line156?
1898,2019-04-28T18:35:40.479100,Maricruz,"line 156 is actually unnecessary I think, you can delete it"
1898,2019-04-28T18:39:07.480000,Maricruz,<@Priscilla> I'm not exactly sure but I think you should remove the `print` from `passed = print('    ' + sn_str + '    PASS - TEST 2')`  and `failed`
1898,2019-04-28T18:39:21.480400,Maricruz,just do `passed = '       ' + sn_str + '       PASS -TEST2'`
1898,2019-04-28T18:40:03.480900,Maricruz,"if you want to print your results to the console, you don't need to store them in a dictionary like I recommended"
1898,2019-04-28T18:40:27.481500,Maricruz,have `test_2` return a string then when looping through your serials you can just do
1898,2019-04-28T18:40:44.482100,Priscilla,its going to be entirely console based
1898,2019-04-28T18:40:53.482300,Maricruz,"```
for serial in serials:
    print (test_2(serial))
```"
1898,2019-04-28T18:44:13.484300,Sasha,"BTW, your mental model of `and` is a little off. `if foo and bar and baz == True` evaluates like `if (foo) and (bar) and (baz == True)`, i.e. it's doing some ""truthiness"" checks and an equality check first, then `and`ing the results."
1898,2019-04-28T18:44:26.484600,Priscilla,"<@Maricruz> i like that much more, simpler code"
1898,2019-04-28T18:45:41.485100,Priscilla,<@Sasha> i didnt know that! thanks for letting me know
1898,2019-04-28T18:53:24.486000,Priscilla,yes! removed the `None` didnt kneed the var at 140

1898,2019-04-28T19:23:07.488900,Priscilla,"so i have a `while True:` loop in my main, and it constantly prints out the pass/fail to the console, if i wanted it to only print when finished I would need to place that `while True` in the `test_2` function, does that sound right?"
1898,2019-04-28T19:24:07.489400,Sasha,"You would probably want to accumulate the output in a string variable, and then print it at the end."
1898,2019-04-28T19:26:23.489900,Sasha,Or use the test results in the dict to create the output after all the testing has been done.
1898,2019-04-28T19:32:05.490300,Priscilla,"ill go with the former, dont have dicts anymore"
1898,2019-04-28T19:38:15.490700,Frankie,damn I have so many API keys for various stuff it's getting kinda annoying. lol

1898,2019-04-28T20:03:31.493900,Sasha,"Same mental-model problem you had with `and`. The `or` operator has to deal with full self-contained expressions, not referencing variables elsewhere in the line. You want `if float_tp4 &gt;= 13.1 or float_tp4 &lt;= 16.5:`. Note also that it's `&gt;=` rather than `=&gt;`."
1898,2019-04-28T20:06:38.495000,Priscilla,aha
1898,2019-04-28T20:06:52.495300,Priscilla,in between
1898,2019-04-28T20:07:42.496400,Sasha,There's a handy shortcut for that: `if 13.1 &lt;= float_tp4 &lt;= 16.5`. Or you can do it with an `and` clause.

1900,2019-04-28T19:55:13.492000,Priscilla,"it doesnt like this, why doesnt it like this?"
1900,2019-04-28T20:06:39.495100,Sasha,"And note that this will be true for any float value. Did you want it to be the other way around, such that the value is between 13.1 and 16.5?"
1900,2019-04-28T20:07:24.496000,Priscilla,i changed them though
1900,2019-04-28T20:08:52.496700,Priscilla,your way is much more readable i think
1900,2019-04-28T20:13:44.496800,Priscilla,what do you think? I am going to run this for all of the test points then use a function called `report()` to check all the test points to be true or false. and if any are false then `report()` will return `FAIL`
1900,2019-04-28T20:15:15.497900,Sasha,"You should probably get into the habit of searching for `""= print""` in your code. Every time you do that, it's a mistake, since `print()` always returns `None`."
1900,2019-04-28T20:16:45.498600,Priscilla,is this the correct way?
1900,2019-04-28T20:17:18.499100,Sasha,Yep. You can also just `return 'pass'` if you want to.
1900,2019-04-28T20:17:54.499600,Priscilla,"alright, i think <@Maricruz> told me that just a min ago too lol"

1900,2019-04-28T20:48:27.009500,Sasha,"The notch was a write-protect tab... open for writeable, or you could cover it up with tape to write-protect it. Single-sided floppies were cheaper, and you could usually use them as double-sided if you cut a second notch and flipped them over."

1900,2019-04-28T21:02:18.019700,Frankie,works fine for me on firefox...lol are you getting that error when using the email confirmation link or when actually logging in?
1900,2019-04-28T21:02:33.020000,Frankie,seems like a bug in how firefox is handling CSRF verification
1900,2019-04-28T21:02:41.020300,Frankie,but it works for me so maybe that extension is causing a problem?
1900,2019-04-28T21:03:01.020900,Priscilla,just typing in the url and clikcing 'login;
1900,2019-04-28T21:03:12.021200,Priscilla,dashlane is the extention
1900,2019-04-28T21:04:50.021700,Frankie,it could be messing w/ CSRF
1900,2019-04-28T21:05:00.022000,Frankie,if it's intercepting the request and passing it along
1900,2019-04-28T21:05:20.022400,Frankie,fwiw I build/develop it on Chrome
1900,2019-04-28T21:05:45.023000,Frankie,I gotta go at the moment but if you try disabling dashlane and it works then let me know. I'll see if I can work out a fix
1900,2019-04-28T21:05:55.023300,Frankie,first time I've seen that and the site has been live for like a year lol
1900,2019-04-28T21:05:56.023400,Priscilla,will this function stop at line 4 this way?
1900,2019-04-28T21:06:24.023900,Priscilla,ill try that <@Frankie>
1900,2019-04-28T21:06:42.024100,Frankie,thank you!
1900,2019-04-28T21:07:31.024700,Priscilla,worked when disabling dashlane :slightly_smiling_face:
1900,2019-04-28T21:07:36.024900,Frankie,interesting.
1900,2019-04-28T21:08:01.025500,Frankie,that extension must be forging the request then so this is actually expected behavior for the CSRF verification
1900,2019-04-28T21:08:35.026000,Priscilla,i use it to automatically fill and login... idk if you kewn that.
1900,2019-04-28T21:08:53.026200,Frankie,nope I didn't
1900,2019-04-28T21:08:57.026400,Frankie,but that's why
1900,2019-04-28T21:09:27.027100,Frankie,CSRF prevents the site from allowing a login from any site that doesn't have a valid CSRF token (which only exists at runtime when you submit the form from the site)
1900,2019-04-28T21:09:39.027500,Frankie,there may be an option in dashlane to pass the token along or something actually
1900,2019-04-28T21:10:08.028000,Frankie,but it's designed as a security precaution so that random sites can't send requests to login and do stuff
1900,2019-04-28T21:10:32.028500,Frankie,"when you run the login page, it generates a random token that gets passed in a hidden field in the form when you click submit"
1900,2019-04-28T21:11:11.029300,Frankie,"if that token is invalid for example if another site intercepted and messed w/ the request, it will return that 403 forbidden message"
1900,2019-04-28T21:11:27.029700,Frankie,but that reminds me I need to Add a 403 template so it doesn't display the exact reason for the failure lol
1900,2019-04-28T21:11:40.030000,Frankie,but at least DEBUG didn't spit out all the site settings and environment variables :smile:
1900,2019-04-28T21:11:58.030500,Frankie,"anyway I gotta run, girlfriend is waiting for me to come over! ttyl and thanks for troubleshooting!"
1900,2019-04-28T21:12:21.031200,Frankie,btw that function will return Pass if your tp4 function call returns True ... that's all I can tell in about 10 seconds of looking at it. lol
1900,2019-04-28T21:12:49.031700,Priscilla,"np, have agood one! :smile: and thanks for all your help too"
1900,2019-04-28T21:13:06.031900,Frankie,:+1:
1900,2019-04-28T21:16:27.032900,Sasha,"<@Priscilla> Regarding the code you posted above, it'll either return `'pass'` or it'll error out because the other `tpN` variables aren't defined."
1900,2019-04-28T21:18:21.034100,Priscilla,"i know i am writting them now, the intent is I need every one of those statement to be true, if one is false, they all `'fail'`."
1900,2019-04-28T21:20:42.035300,Priscilla,on it
1900,2019-04-28T21:23:44.035500,Priscilla,thats perfect
1900,2019-04-29T03:44:08.043000,Jonas,Click comes with a function to find a suitable directory for a config 
1900,2019-04-29T03:44:24.043400,Jonas,Check out ‘appdirs’ on PyPI as well
1900,2019-04-29T03:48:42.044100,Jimmy,the best way would be to package it as a debian package (.deb) but that's a bit more complicated
1900,2019-04-29T04:01:51.044800,Lavinia,<@Jonas> does appdirs works out of the box with Tox?
1900,2019-04-29T04:02:29.045600,Lavinia,<@Jimmy> we have people working on windows that use python so .deb will not work for them in the futur
1900,2019-04-29T04:05:16.046900,Jimmy,you mentioned ubuntu that's why. If you have to manage linux + windows I think using a tool that deal with path is the best way to go
1900,2019-04-29T04:52:40.047600,Lavinia,"<@Jimmy> true, but I think appdirs look promising"
1901,2019-04-28T21:19:32.035100,Sasha,"In that case you probably want to do `if not tpN: return 'fail'` on each one, and only return `'pass'` at the end if you got through all of them."
1902,2019-04-28T21:23:58.035800,Priscilla,what do you guys listen to when coding?
1903,2019-04-29T03:32:55.042200,Lavinia,"hello I am a newbie in python packaging but I was able to do everything, it's a cli that should work on ubuntu (linux like). My application is a cli and rely on an external configuration file, but I have no idea how to deal with it? Should I put it in .config/mycli/conf.ini or /etc/mycli/conf.ini. more over if I want to delete it using `pip uninstall mycli` will it also delete the conf ?

1906,2019-04-29T09:40:46.063400,Hiroko,have you found anything via google? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1906,2019-04-29T09:49:42.065700,Alvina,"a couple results - but it seems to be geared towards automating starting a VMWare, powering it off etc"
1906,2019-04-29T09:51:35.066500,Hiroko,"<@Ming> spyder is an IDE, and doesn’t have anything to do with the execution of your program"
1906,2019-04-29T09:51:46.066800,Hiroko,that’s passed off to the python interpreter you’re using
1906,2019-04-29T09:52:07.067200,Hiroko,and profiling programs is definitely a bit of a black art
1906,2019-04-29T09:52:53.067800,Hiroko,one thing you can try to do is ensure you have the C/C++ dependencies for python libs installed
1906,2019-04-29T09:53:25.068600,Hiroko,"for example, if you’re running numpy and doing linalg, having BLAS installed locally will have a major speedup vs having numpy run all those calcs in pure python"
1906,2019-04-29T09:57:34.069800,Ming,Okay. I know which bit is significantly slowing down the running of the script. Maybe someone can help me see whether there would be a more efficient way of doing this?
1906,2019-04-29T09:57:37.070100,Ming,"`list_indexes_master_dataframe = master_dataframe.index.values.tolist()`
`master_dataframe['nans CH']   = ''`

`for each in NAN_indexes:`
   ` if each &lt; master_dataframe.index[-1] and each &gt; 180000:`
      `  if each in list_indexes_master_dataframe:`
          `  master_dataframe.loc[each, 'nans CH'] = 'nan'`"
1906,2019-04-29T10:01:35.072900,Ming,"Basically I have a dataframe with data that has been downsampled -&gt; master_dataframe
And I have a list of indexes where the data point was a nan (before applying interpolation)
On a different column (called 'nans CH') I want to write 'nan' next to the new interpolated value"
1906,2019-04-29T10:02:31.073900,Ming,"So if a value in the dataframe with the data was nan before, I want to write a 'nan' next to it (on the same row, thus using the same index)"
1906,2019-04-29T10:05:48.076600,Clemmie,"I’m guessing that iterating through `list_index_ master_dataframe` to look up if `each` is in it is slowing you down a bunch. If the values in `list_index_ master_dataframe` are unique you can speed up your work by making that a dict, with all the values the keys, and an empty value. This will speed it up because you are going from O(n) for the list evaluation to amortized O(1) dict key lookup"
1906,2019-04-29T10:07:12.077800,Clemmie,"also - I don’t know dataframes so well - but to me `master_dataframe.loc[each, 'nans CH'] = 'nan'` sure looks like it is doing a lookup. You can probably get rid of `if each in list_indexes_master_dataframe:` and just wrap `master_dataframe.loc[each, 'nans CH'] = 'nan'` in a try/except"
1906,2019-04-29T10:08:47.078500,Ming,Yep. The second part makes sense. I implemented a try/except now
1906,2019-04-29T10:09:13.079100,Ming,But I didn't understand well making the list of indexes into a dictionary
1906,2019-04-29T10:10:07.079700,Ming,The values in `list_index_ master_dataframe` are unique
1906,2019-04-29T10:10:18.079900,Frankie,good morning everyone. here for another day of geekery.
1906,2019-04-29T10:12:02.080700,Hiroko,<@Ming> the difference is in the lookup
1906,2019-04-29T10:12:15.081200,Hiroko,"with a list, you have to iterate through each and every index"
1906,2019-04-29T10:12:25.081800,Hiroko,"with a dict, you just need the key for a lookup"
1906,2019-04-29T10:12:34.082000,Clemmie,but if you wrapped the try except it doesn’t look like you even need `list_index_ master_dataframe` anymore
1906,2019-04-29T10:13:24.082400,Ming,Yes. You are right

1906,2019-04-29T10:17:18.084400,Ming,Actually the try doesn't quite work because it will always work. Even if the index doesn't exist yet in the dataframe. It will create a new one. I will try using the dictionary
1906,2019-04-29T10:18:15.084600,Nola,was this to my question or another question?

1906,2019-04-29T10:22:55.086400,Marth,<@Nola> what about a merge? `df = data_1.merge(data_2)`  or if you want to replace data_1 `data_1 = data_1.merge(data_2)`
1906,2019-04-29T10:23:16.086800,Marth,merge also has options if your data is more complex than your sample
1906,2019-04-29T10:26:50.087900,Nola,like this example

1906,2019-04-29T10:51:12.094900,Clemmie,maybe? You would have to hook into the OS via it’s calls - certainly more than anything I have ever done

1906,2019-04-29T11:24:12.100100,Marth,"you may look into this sort of syntax (untested, so it may not work or be the solution you're looking for): `right_on=[['ID', 'Date']]`  I can't remember if that's correct syntax or if `right_on=['ID', 'Date']` is the right way, but I think you get the idea that you can provide merge with a list"

1908,2019-04-29T11:08:31.099500,Marth,<@Nola> you may want to also look at: <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html#combining-joining-merging>
1908,2019-04-29T11:21:30.099900,Marth,I'm guessing the pandas `merge` function is what you're probably looking for.  It's hard to know for sure without knowing more of your data.  You may want to have a look at merge (from the link I posted above).  Keeping in mind you can provide a list to the `right_on` and `left_on` options.
1909,2019-04-29T10:35:37.092900,Blythe,"Hi all, I'm new here I was wondering how can I make a python script to disable the shortcut key Alt + F4"

1910,2019-04-29T12:12:59.101900,Frankie,soo - anyone wanna do some sleuthing for me? I'm a part time mentor for a software dev company and I suspect one of my students has copied his entire project from somewhere else. anyone know if there's a way to tell if a github repo was cloned/copied even if it's not forked?
1910,2019-04-29T12:13:50.103000,Frankie,"basically the entire project is 95% finished in the first commit, dude doesn't speak good english, yet his readme is perfect english, lol, and the whole project uses tons of concepts and tech not taught in the course he would have taken."
1910,2019-04-29T12:14:51.104300,Frankie,"he didn't fork the repo from anywhere, that was the first thing I checked, but I suspect he cloned/copied it from somewhere and just uploaded it as his own which would be bad"
1910,2019-04-29T12:14:58.104500,Carmen,That sounds like picking a few whole sentences and doing a site-search via Google.
1910,2019-04-29T12:15:21.105200,Carmen,Toss me the repo link and I'll poke at it.
1910,2019-04-29T12:15:31.105500,Frankie,yeah I did that in the readme for one or two sentences but couldn't find anything - I'm still trying cause I really don't believe this dude did it himself. lol
1910,2019-04-29T12:16:03.106300,Frankie,I'll PM the repo to anyone but want to keep it out of this chat just cause I don't wanna throw him under the bus if he did do it himself by some miracle :smile:
1910,2019-04-29T12:16:43.106800,Clemmie,sounds like fun - toss it my way too
1910,2019-04-29T12:17:55.107100,Frankie,"thanks guys, link sent! detective internet is on the case"
1910,2019-04-29T12:18:26.107700,Frankie,"to be fair his other readmes are also good, so it's possible he outsourced the work and just paid someone to do it for him, lol"
1910,2019-04-29T12:21:26.109500,Elanor,that's also a reasonable suspicion
1910,2019-04-29T12:21:49.110300,Elanor,there are definitely a lot of services out there that help people with interviews including coding problems
1910,2019-04-29T12:21:58.110800,Elanor,so he could have just tossed some cash to one of those services
1910,2019-04-29T12:22:54.111800,Jimmy,afaik you can kill the fork relationships on github
1910,2019-04-29T12:23:02.112200,Jimmy,or just fork and upload elsewhere
1910,2019-04-29T12:23:07.112400,Frankie,"other facts that make me feel this is not his work: first time he sent me the repo it was awful ... env files everywhere, literal command line commands somehow in the repo (e.g. there was a file called `python app.py` as if he'd tried to type it into the command line, lol) lib/site-packages in the repo, files all out of order ... just looked like he tried to clone it and it didn't work right away so he started trying to make it work and broke it even worse. He then came to me asking for help, I told him the project was basically all over the place and he needed to start over and go back to the course materials, he assured me it was all his work after I questioned it that time and said he would redo it...3 days later, this giant project all in one commit again like he did it all in three days? this guy is a student, not a seasoned developer so it makes me question this a lot."
1910,2019-04-29T12:23:56.112800,Elanor,you could start asking questions regarding why he made the decisions he did
1910,2019-04-29T12:24:09.113200,Elanor,ask him to explain certain parts of the code to you in detail
1910,2019-04-29T12:24:27.113600,Elanor,treat it like an interview
1910,2019-04-29T12:24:43.114100,Elanor,he should be able to explain the decisions that were made and the structure of the code
1910,2019-04-29T12:25:32.115600,Frankie,that's exactly what I plan to do today when I meet w/ him. Just going to tell him to take me through his code and explain what it does.
1910,2019-04-29T12:25:33.115700,Clemmie,Even if he did hire someone to write it - oof that `Quantity` model
1910,2019-04-29T12:26:26.116500,Frankie,but I'm pretty sure <@Sasha> just nailed it - sent me another repo that looks pretty much identical and it's a past submission from another student that took the same course. yikes.
1910,2019-04-29T12:26:41.116700,Clemmie,show us!!!
1910,2019-04-29T12:27:14.117000,Elanor,Ooooh
1910,2019-04-29T12:27:15.117100,Carlo,oh wow
1910,2019-04-29T12:27:26.117700,Elanor,ok so here's what you need to do
1910,2019-04-29T12:27:29.118100,Elanor,put up a <http://twitch.tv|twitch.tv> link
1910,2019-04-29T12:27:31.118300,Elanor,livestream this shit
1910,2019-04-29T12:27:32.118500,Frankie,this is def a copied project. all he did is change the CSS lol
1910,2019-04-29T12:27:33.118600,Claudine,lol
1910,2019-04-29T12:27:40.118900,Carlo,jesus christ... I mean
1910,2019-04-29T12:27:42.119100,Frankie,man that pisses me off. I knew it
1910,2019-04-29T12:28:05.119400,Clemmie,<@Sasha> :taco:
1910,2019-04-29T12:28:18.119800,Claudine,that's unfortunate :disappointed:
1910,2019-04-29T12:28:37.120100,Leana,None
1910,2019-04-29T12:28:40.120300,Claudine,why take courses to cheat :disappointed:
1910,2019-04-29T12:28:55.120800,Elanor,because you're forced to? Because you don't actually care?
1910,2019-04-29T12:29:07.121500,Frankie,<@Sasha> you now get credit for making this guy fail the course. lol
1910,2019-04-29T12:29:10.121900,Frankie,I blame you.
1910,2019-04-29T12:29:11.122000,Carlo,"let's be honest though, htat guy is probably not the sharpest tool in the shed"
1910,2019-04-29T12:29:11.122100,Elanor,I mean I don't do that but I get that some people just don't give a shit and are forced to for whatever reason
1910,2019-04-29T12:29:49.123900,Frankie,but I mean really if you're gonna cheat WHY take the code from someone who took the same course and submitted it to the same assessors...like they weren't going to notice?!!?
1910,2019-04-29T12:29:52.124100,Carlo,"after the first suspicion, he still submits a plagiarized project"
1910,2019-04-29T12:30:16.125100,Carlo,that doesnt show a lot of foresight lol
1910,2019-04-29T12:30:17.125200,Frankie,well the thing is I'm not actually an assessor ... he hasn't actually submitted it yet.
1910,2019-04-29T12:30:23.125600,Frankie,so I MIGHT be able to save him lol
1910,2019-04-29T12:30:24.125700,Clemmie,"<@Elanor> sure - but at least hide it better (not condoning). Now he is going to fail, possibly be kicked out, and if not maybe have to take it again"
1910,2019-04-29T12:30:33.126000,Elanor,I agree
1910,2019-04-29T12:30:49.126500,Elanor,I just think back to when I was in college taking bullshit GenEd courses
1910,2019-04-29T12:30:58.127100,Elanor,I guarantee to you some of them meant nothing in the grand scheme of things
1910,2019-04-29T12:31:00.127300,Elanor,at least for me
1910,2019-04-29T12:31:13.127700,Frankie,I am going to tell him absolutely do not do not do not submit it and DO THE PROJECT YOURSELF or else he is gonna end up failing and forfeiting the $6k he paid for the course ...
1910,2019-04-29T12:31:38.128900,Elanor,can you at least livestream the part where you show him the code he copied from?
1910,2019-04-29T12:31:39.129000,Carlo,lol @ risking $6k over laziness
1910,2019-04-29T12:32:06.130100,Diego,Google interview in python or java?
1910,2019-04-29T12:32:21.131100,Clemmie,and then send him a link to <#C64GEEM7U|job_advice> to see that even people who actually do the work and know this stuff can have a hard time finding a job
1910,2019-04-29T12:32:22.131200,Frankie,"I feel bad cause I suspect a lot of the reason he did this is he can't speak english very well. He is trying to better his life learning a new language and a new skill which I'm sure makes it very hard to understand the course material, but dude...ask for help. I'll help you lol"
1910,2019-04-29T12:32:53.131900,Frankie,or we'll get someone who speaks your language to help
1910,2019-04-29T12:33:27.132600,Diego,already did
1910,2019-04-29T12:33:32.132800,Diego,danke
1910,2019-04-29T12:35:26.133400,Frankie,alright well thanks internet sleuths for confirming my suspicions. I :heart: the internets
1910,2019-04-29T12:35:56.134100,Frankie,and while I would love to livestream of the ensuing awkwardness I don't think that would be very professional of me lol
1910,2019-04-29T12:36:44.134500,Elanor,"Well no, you went and humanized him so now the enjoyment factor is gone"
1910,2019-04-29T12:37:00.134900,Frankie,I know right :disappointed:
1910,2019-04-29T12:37:08.135100,Elanor,"now it's ""guy trying to learn english and new skills"" and not just ""lazy jackass trying to cheat through class"""
1910,2019-04-29T12:37:30.135500,Frankie,I know. It's like making fun of a kindergartner :disappointed:
1910,2019-04-29T12:37:31.135700,Frankie,lol
1910,2019-04-29T12:37:40.135900,Frankie,I can't do that
1910,2019-04-29T12:38:19.136600,Frankie,I hope he can get over this hump though and actually make something of himself. He's from a pretty bad area of the world so I can appreciate the struggle but this can't fly unfortunately lol
1910,2019-04-29T12:39:10.137400,Frankie,"hopefully this will be one of those stories where ""can't speak english, couldn't even write a line of code, cheated on first project...then went on to develop <http://Google.com|Google.com> and became a multibillionaire"" :smile:"
1911,2019-04-29T12:33:11.132400,Clemmie,<@Diego> are you asking what they interview in? you might want to bring it up in <#C64GEEM7U|job_advice>
1912,2019-04-29T14:09:39.138000,Emelda,"Is there anything wrong with calling windows commands with the os module vs programmatically doing something in python?
I haven't found a way to delete specific keys from windows credential manager other than `os.system('cmd command')`"
1912,2019-04-29T14:11:01.138900,Elanor,"eh, if nothing more elegant is immediately obvious then do what solves your problem first and foremost and then keep digging to see if it can be refactored"
1912,2019-04-29T14:13:21.139700,Emelda,My goal for learning python is to replace a lot of my Powershell scripts with python version for more cross-platform action
1912,2019-04-29T14:18:25.140300,Elanor,do you have a cross-platform equivalent for windows credential manager elsewhere?
1912,2019-04-29T14:27:48.143200,Lydia,"Keepass, Lastpass"
1912,2019-04-29T14:29:35.145900,Emelda,"No this would be an action IF the os is windows, I am planning on having multiple functions which only one would trigger if os check came back for it's corresponding os"
1912,2019-04-29T14:30:34.146800,Emelda,Might not work out like I plan
1912,2019-04-29T14:30:51.147200,Emelda,But I'm using this as an opportunity to learn python
1912,2019-04-29T14:33:51.147500,Ouida,"might sound like a trivial question, but is there a simple function to get the following:
given a range (A, B) (0&lt;A&lt;B), return a number X so that: ```A &lt; X &lt; B or -B &lt; X &lt; -A``` [EDITED]
I want the distribution to be uniform. I don't really care about the inequality (can be either `&lt;` or `&lt;=`).
I can use Numpy if that helps.
So far I have come up with something the smells too complex to me: ```
    s, e = 3, 5
    w = e - s  # the range's width = 2
    rnd = random.random() * 2 * w  # will give a number between 0 and 4
    rnd -= w  # will center the range to be between -2 and 2
    rnd += (s if rnd &gt; 0 else -s)
```

:face_palm:"
1912,2019-04-29T14:35:26.148200,Claudine,"wont `range(a, b)` do that already? so then you just need to pick a random X but slice the first and last values off your range"
1912,2019-04-29T14:35:56.148700,Hiroko,check out `numpy.random.uniform`
1912,2019-04-29T14:36:03.148900,Ouida,no... range gives an integer range of numbers... I need a single number
1912,2019-04-29T14:36:09.149200,Hiroko,<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.uniform.html>
1912,2019-04-29T14:36:13.149400,Claudine,yea just pick a single number from that range
1912,2019-04-29T14:36:45.150000,Claudine,"so long as your `a` is less than your `b` it should work, if `b` is less than `a` `range` will return nothing and your thing will ded"
1912,2019-04-29T14:38:11.150200,Claudine,"or
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.randrange(a,b)

```"
1912,2019-04-29T14:38:15.150400,Claudine,unless i am mistaken
1912,2019-04-29T14:38:36.150800,Claudine,well in that case your X could be == A or B
1912,2019-04-29T14:41:28.151800,Sasha,"Note that you're asking for X &gt; A and X &lt; -A, which is impossible if A &gt; 0."
1912,2019-04-29T14:46:01.152800,Claudine,oh i assumed he meant `-X` for that side
1912,2019-04-29T14:46:07.153000,Claudine,brain just added that `-` on it's own
1912,2019-04-29T14:47:48.153700,Ouida,<@Sasha> I don't understand - what's impossible? note that I said `0 &lt; A &lt; B`.
1912,2019-04-29T14:49:06.155400,Ouida,"<@Claudine> I want a uniform distribution in the following split range: `(-B, -A), (A, B)` and I don't care of it's inclusive or exclusive from either side."
1912,2019-04-29T14:49:17.155600,Clemmie,"but you are asking for X &lt; -A, X &gt; A."
1912,2019-04-29T14:49:41.156100,Clemmie,"Assuming A &gt; -A, then X &lt; -A &lt; A &lt; X"
1912,2019-04-29T14:49:49.156300,Clemmie,so… X &lt; X
1912,2019-04-29T14:50:39.157100,Ouida,OK OK sorry :slightly_smiling_face: I meant OR. The returned value of the requested function should be somewhere in that range. See the example code I posted. It's working. I just wanted something that looks nicer.
1912,2019-04-29T14:50:48.157500,Ouida,I'm editing the original message
1912,2019-04-29T14:51:52.158500,Clemmie,"build a uniform distribution in the range -B -&gt; B, then throw out any values -A -&gt; A?"
1912,2019-04-29T14:52:21.158900,Ouida,"<@Clemmie> that wouldn't give a uniform dist in this range `(-B, -A), (A, B)`"
1912,2019-04-29T14:54:01.159700,Clemmie,"Isn’t that a multimodal distribution, or 2 different uniform distributions? I’m not sure what it is to have a uniform distribution over 2 discrete ranges"

1912,2019-04-29T15:18:52.163400,Clemmie,"I tend to write classes even for one offs, because 1) it helps me put my thinking together and 2) can make it easier to encapsulate/extend in the future. So most of my standalone scripts have a main of

But then changes to a symbol of one kind are not reflected in others of the same kind.  Any thoughts?"

However, this is generally considered bad practice versus just making a function for the code... you can pass around references to it like any other variable and call it later."

1917,2019-04-29T19:47:29.178600,Priscilla,is this the best way to run a `while` loop for a set amount of time? do you guys use anything specific for this kind of goal?
1917,2019-04-29T19:47:55.179200,Priscilla,"im taking a bout a loop running for  hours, not seconds"

1918,2019-04-30T01:05:29.181500,Nella,How can I replace multiple dash with one dash using regex?
1918,2019-04-30T01:06:25.181800,Nella,"```match_dash = re.compile('/-+/')
string = match_dash.sub('example---dash', '-')```
Why this code don’t work for me?"
1918,2019-04-30T01:08:14.182600,Chester,Why do you have slashes in your regex?
1918,2019-04-30T01:12:55.183000,Sparkle,you dont need the 2 slashes in python only in javascript <@Nella>
1918,2019-04-30T01:13:10.183300,Nella,"Oh, I see…"
1918,2019-04-30T01:14:17.183900,Nella,"but even if I remove slashes, I still can’t get it"
1918,2019-04-30T01:19:12.184400,Sasha,"Can you post what you're seeing? It should work:
```&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub('-+', '-', 'example---dash')
'example-dash'```"
1918,2019-04-30T01:21:04.185000,Sasha,"Oh, sorry, you need to swap the parameter order in `sub()`."
1918,2019-04-30T01:21:18.185200,Nella,Now it works.
1918,2019-04-30T01:21:26.185500,Nella,Thanks so much

1923,2019-04-30T10:21:56.198100,Conchita,I'm getting another strange error when running another script now (Python been acting a bit strange ever since I installed Google Cloud SDK)
1923,2019-04-30T10:22:57.198400,Conchita,"When running this I'm getting

```FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/justine/Desktop/black_magic/Whale 2.0/collect/data/pot/pot_300419.csv'
```"
1923,2019-04-30T10:23:30.199000,Conchita,My code is supposed to create this file that it returns doesn't exist
1923,2019-04-30T10:24:14.200100,Conchita,"I ran the same script earlier today for other subdomains without an issue, and have done this for about six months for aobut 14 subdomains, including this one until today"
1923,2019-04-30T10:25:24.201300,Conchita,"(normally this loops through multiple subdomains similar to `pot`, but removed it for an easier read)"
1923,2019-04-30T10:26:20.202200,Conchita,I have double checked that the path is correct
1923,2019-04-30T10:26:23.202300,Clemmie,Does the file exists?
1923,2019-04-30T10:26:27.202500,Clemmie,"yes, ok"
1923,2019-04-30T10:26:48.202900,Conchita,"The file doesn't exist, it should be created by this script"
1923,2019-04-30T10:27:31.203600,Clemmie,"ah, I see, the `to_csv`"
1923,2019-04-30T10:27:49.204000,Clemmie,are you possibly running this script with permissions that don’t have write access?
1923,2019-04-30T10:29:08.205300,Conchita,"It has created files to the same directory by the same user profile for many months, and nothing I have done today should have changed that (runs locally)"
1923,2019-04-30T10:29:22.205500,Clemmie,for a sanity check - from a cli can you run `touch /Users/justine/Desktop/black_magic/Whale 2.0/collect/data/pot/pot_300419.csv`
1923,2019-04-30T10:29:37.205800,Clemmie,that should create an empty file with that path/name
1923,2019-04-30T10:31:10.206300,Conchita,"That gave ```touch /Users/justine/Desktop/black_magic/Whale 2.0/collect/data/pot/pot_300419.csv

1923,2019-04-30T10:31:27.207000,Conchita,Could it be an issue with the space in `Whale 2.0`?
1923,2019-04-30T10:31:28.207200,Clemmie,ok - it doesn’t like that path
1923,2019-04-30T10:31:40.207700,Clemmie,"oh, yeah - a space will cause all sorts of issues"
1923,2019-04-30T10:31:42.207800,Conchita,haha seems not
1923,2019-04-30T10:32:07.208300,Clemmie,you need the escape spaces in paths with `/` - much easier to just not have them
1923,2019-04-30T10:32:32.208800,Clemmie,can you move that folder to `Whale_2.0` or `Whale2.0`?
1923,2019-04-30T10:33:30.209200,Clemmie,whitespace is the bane of file structure navigation
1923,2019-04-30T10:33:54.209600,Conchita,"Noted, and tried. But same result"
1923,2019-04-30T10:34:23.209800,Clemmie,same error?
1923,2019-04-30T10:34:40.210000,Emelda,How would I find files with a specific extension in a directory using os module
1923,2019-04-30T10:35:39.210300,Conchita,"Yes ```touch /Users/justine/Desktop/black_magic/Whale2.0/collect/data/pot/pot_300419.csv

1923,2019-04-30T10:36:03.210600,Clemmie,can you `cd /Users/justine/Desktop/black_magic/Whale2.0/collect/data/pot`
1923,2019-04-30T10:36:05.210800,Clemmie,?

1923,2019-04-30T10:37:30.211700,Conchita,ops!
1923,2019-04-30T10:38:04.212000,Conchita,I was able to cd into it
1923,2019-04-30T10:38:29.212500,Clemmie,<@Emelda> you want to use `[f for f in os.listdir('.') if os.path.isfile(f)]` to get all the files in the current directory and use a regex or simple string matching to match on the extension of choice
1923,2019-04-30T10:38:47.213200,Conchita,And I'm finding all the other files there when using `ls`
1923,2019-04-30T10:38:48.213300,Clemmie,"<@Conchita> now that you are in it can you `touch` the file name, or even `touch a`?"
1923,2019-04-30T10:40:31.214100,Conchita,"Yes, while in the dir, I could successfully `touch` the file name"
1923,2019-04-30T10:40:38.214300,Conchita,Which created an empty csv file
1923,2019-04-30T10:41:42.214800,Clemmie,`rm`  the file and try the script again for me?
1923,2019-04-30T10:42:07.215400,Clemmie,be fore you run the script do `cd ~` and then `cd` back into the script folder
1923,2019-04-30T10:44:54.216500,Conchita,"Followed all your steps, including rm the file successfully, but same result when running the script ```FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/justine/Desktop/black_magic/Whale2.0/collect/data/pot/pot_300419.csv'```"

1923,2019-04-30T10:47:11.218000,Clemmie,does that whole path exist?
1923,2019-04-30T10:49:13.218800,Conchita,Nice eyes
1923,2019-04-30T10:49:26.219200,Conchita,this is my dir structure:
1923,2019-04-30T10:51:17.221100,Conchita,"```Whale2.0
--\init.py
--\collect
    --\cryptoid.py (the script)
--\data
    --\pot (the dir the script should create the file in)
        --\ x```"
1923,2019-04-30T10:51:46.221700,Conchita,"Maybe because I cd into collect, that it gave off this traceback?"
1923,2019-04-30T10:52:31.222700,Clemmie,"ok - so that `ROOT_DIR` bit won’t work because it is giving you the root of the script, but the script is in a different section of the tree than where you want the data."
1923,2019-04-30T10:53:07.222900,Clemmie,wait…
1923,2019-04-30T10:54:22.224400,Clemmie,"I’m confused by the naming of collect.py and cryptoid.py - is cryptoid in a folder called collect, and the collect folder is a sibling to a file called collect.py?"
1923,2019-04-30T10:55:00.225200,Conchita,"Sorry - `collect.py` should be `collect` - its a directory, not a script"
1923,2019-04-30T10:55:17.225600,Clemmie,"ok, so what i said above is the same"
1923,2019-04-30T10:56:10.226300,Conchita,"Yes, I must change the `ROOT_DIR`"
1923,2019-04-30T10:56:15.226500,Clemmie,replace csv_dir with `csv_path = os.path.split(ROOT_DIR)[0] + f'/data/{coin}/{coin}_{todays_date}.csv'`
1923,2019-04-30T10:56:56.227500,Clemmie,`split` splits the terminal folder from the tree into a tuple

1923,2019-04-30T10:57:47.228400,Conchita,I wish I could send you the feeling I have now as a thanks

1923,2019-04-30T10:59:19.231000,Clemmie,"then you can move code wherever, and not need to worry about the file stuff getting out of sync with where things live"

1925,2019-04-30T12:21:53.244600,Clemmie,why do you want it as a pure string
1925,2019-04-30T12:22:16.244800,Emelda,Because Python is trying to interpret it as python and not windows command line

1925,2019-04-30T12:27:54.246300,Emelda,What's the difference?
1925,2019-04-30T12:28:48.246500,Clemmie,"from the `os.system` docs:
&gt;The subprocess module provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is preferable to using this function. See the Replacing Older Functions with the subprocess Module section in the subprocess documentation for some helpful recipes.’"
1925,2019-04-30T12:28:54.246700,Emelda,nvm quick google search told me
1925,2019-04-30T12:29:05.246900,Emelda,But yea that
1926,2019-04-30T12:39:42.248600,Sasha,"I'm not completely sure I understand what makes them ""not good"", but one thing which pops out is that they reference `self.dataframe`, which doesn't seem to exist. Perhaps you want your `__init__` routine to grab its `dataframe` argument and save it as `self.dataframe`?"
1926,2019-04-30T12:42:16.249900,Sasha,"You're also sort of using the class like just a nested function, doing a bunch of computation and output in the `__init__` function and then discarding the object afterwards. It's not technically wrong, but it's unexpected."
1927,2019-04-30T13:14:45.250300,Nenita,yea i fixed the self.dataframe portion. i just notice i have function calls that are just bare.
1927,2019-04-30T13:31:10.250500,Nenita,"So the first line works fine. Printing the row data shows it inserts just fine, however the second line runs fine, but doesn't insert the data if i print the row data? What am I doing wrong?"
1927,2019-04-30T13:31:32.250900,Nenita,nvm
1927,2019-04-30T13:31:39.251200,Nenita,just saw my dictionary isnt built properly
1927,2019-04-30T13:38:31.251900,Nenita,"alright so my code works fine and all, but when exporting my dataframe, it doesn't retain the values that have been inserted?"
1927,2019-04-30T13:39:04.252600,Nenita,"if i print the row data as the code is running, it will show that the data has been inserted into the correct location, but it doesn't show any data was inserted after exporting the dataframe"
1927,2019-04-30T13:40:07.253600,Sasha,"Sounds like you've done something to duplicate the dataframe along the way, and are exporting a different variable than the one you're modifying."
1927,2019-04-30T13:40:29.254000,Sasha,Some Pandas calls return a new dataframe rather than modify the original.
1927,2019-04-30T13:41:39.255200,Nenita,ive never encountered this issue before and i just insert the same df into each function.
1927,2019-04-30T13:42:13.255600,Nenita,"its the same code as above, but just with the fixed 'self.dataframe'"
1927,2019-04-30T13:43:06.256200,Sasha,Can you post your revised `__init__`?
1927,2019-04-30T13:43:09.256300,Nenita,im gunna try something real quick as a test
1927,2019-04-30T13:43:10.256500,Nenita,sure
1927,2019-04-30T13:43:54.256600,Nenita,not much revision tbh though
1927,2019-04-30T13:44:29.256900,Nenita,this is the line i use when inserting my df to be used across all functions
1927,2019-04-30T13:45:16.257600,Nenita,im gunna change the dataframe.to_csv to payroll.to_csv and see if that makes a difference
1927,2019-04-30T13:45:29.258000,Nenita,nope no change
1927,2019-04-30T13:45:39.258400,Nenita,wth :thinking_face:
1927,2019-04-30T13:45:55.258800,Sasha,"Can you check the timestamp on your output .CSV file? I'm suspicious of the backslash in the filename, so it may not be being saved where you think it should be."
1927,2019-04-30T13:46:16.259000,Sasha,"Oh, never mind, raw string."
1927,2019-04-30T13:46:46.259700,Nenita,"other than the data coming from pyodbc, i may be able to make some changes so you can run it for yourself."
1927,2019-04-30T13:47:42.260100,Nenita,yea give me a sec. ill set this up so you can run it from your end if you choose to
1927,2019-04-30T13:50:18.261300,Sasha,"Ah, I think I see the problem. The documentation for `iterrows()` says, ""You should never modify something you are iterating over. This is not guaranteed to work in all cases. Depending on the data types, the iterator returns a copy and not a view, and writing to it will have no effect."" So when you are changing `data[]` values, it isn't necessarily getting propagated into the dataframe."
1927,2019-04-30T13:50:40.261500,Nenita,ah that makes sense.
1927,2019-04-30T13:50:52.261900,Nenita,so will i need to use csv reader?
1927,2019-04-30T13:52:22.262200,Nenita,wait. i may just need a return on the iterrows()
1927,2019-04-30T13:52:27.262400,Nenita,so it returns the new copy
1927,2019-04-30T13:53:52.262900,Nenita,"omg, even putting the df.to_csv at the end of my iterrows() it still doesnt export the copy"
1927,2019-04-30T13:55:53.264400,Sasha,"Yeah, the trouble is there isn't any ""copy""... each data value is getting discarded the next time through the loop. You may want to consider creating a new dataframe as you go, or else iterating through the primary keys and modifying the dataframe row in-place."
1927,2019-04-30T13:56:09.264700,Emelda,"```for process in (process for process in psutil.process_iter() if process.name()==""firefox.exe""):

this doesn't seem to be working for me for some reason, does anyone know why this would be?"
1927,2019-04-30T13:56:39.265100,Emelda,it seems to be taking forever to run and then the process is still running
1927,2019-04-30T13:59:19.265600,Emelda,ok seems i have to match the process name exactly if it's case sensitive
1927,2019-04-30T13:59:27.265800,Emelda,but man does it take forever
1927,2019-04-30T14:03:25.268800,Nenita,figured it out <@Sasha>
1927,2019-04-30T14:03:28.269200,Clemmie,"reading the docs it sounds like it does a lot to setup. It seems like you could speed things up if you take a look at <https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#filtering-and-sorting-processes> - passing just one or two attributes, and doing and `info` dict lookup instead of calling the `.name()` method might make things faster"
1927,2019-04-30T14:07:35.269300,Nenita,"this is the final result. problem is if i print the row data before and after inserting values into hireddate, the hireddate column is not at the end."
1927,2019-04-30T14:08:10.269600,Nenita,this the printout before and after inserting values into hireddate. it doesnt create the column. only the column shows after exporting?
1927,2019-04-30T14:09:40.270000,Nenita,oh

1927,2019-04-30T14:14:08.272000,Clemmie,Amazon user review of what? A project you built?
1927,2019-04-30T14:14:34.272600,Clemmie,"If yes, then don’t put the reviews in the resume, just the project - they will go look at the project and the reviews if they are interested"
1928,2019-04-30T14:00:59.266400,Clemmie,you can do `process.name().lower` and evaluate against all lower case

1931,2019-04-30T18:01:30.286700,Shirley,"hey all - I have a few data miners that I am writing which I'd like to run daily, and have the ability to keep track of what ran, if it failed, etc.
I understand there are task queues that I could use (e.g. celery), but they all seem to require setting up the task queue and monitoring separate.

Any advice on what would be the simplest method to schedule, log, and monitor the jobs?"
1931,2019-04-30T18:18:14.287400,Maricruz,"<@Shirley> are you on linux? I'd schedule a `cronjob` for each of your data miners, you can have it output the log to wherever you want."
1931,2019-04-30T18:18:26.287800,Shirley,windows unfortunately
1931,2019-04-30T18:18:29.287900,Maricruz,Windows has `task scheduler`
1931,2019-04-30T18:18:58.289000,Maricruz,"I haven't used it much though...there's probably a better Python scheduler out there, I'll let someone more knowledgeable chime in"
1931,2019-04-30T18:18:59.289200,Shirley,"I was thinking about task scheduler, but I was not sure how reliable that would be in the long term?"
1932,2019-04-30T18:29:25.290600,Sasha,"<@Nenita> There's not enough context to really see what's going on. Two possibilities that come to mind: there's a recursive call to the same function, or maybe there's an exception that is caught by a retry loop at a higher level of the code."
1933,2019-04-30T18:46:55.291300,Priscilla,"how can i grab a variable from another function to use it?
like:
```"
1933,2019-04-30T18:48:00.292700,Jamison,"<@Priscilla> why would you want to, as opposed to returning that variable"
1933,2019-04-30T18:48:35.293200,Priscilla,"```
if test_1 == 'PASS':
    foo = ', PASS'
else:
    bar = ', FAIL'
```"
1933,2019-04-30T18:50:10.295800,Priscilla,"well, i need a loop that creates a string for each item in my list and will populate 'PASS' or 'FAIL' depending on how they perform in each test... so it can be written to a CSV. I already have a for statement that itterates through for one test like so"
1933,2019-04-30T18:50:30.296100,Priscilla,None
1933,2019-04-30T18:50:42.296600,Sasha,"You can't generally ""grab"" variables from within functions. You can (a) use a global variable, (b) have the function return the data, or (c) pass in some kind of container to the function for it to modify. Sometimes this sort of need is also a sign that you may want to have the functions as part of a class with shared state."
1933,2019-04-30T18:51:35.297200,Priscilla,"i looked into that and I dont really understand shared states, and not even really classes"
1933,2019-04-30T18:51:59.298000,Priscilla,unfortunately I dont have time to try and implement that right now ya know
1933,2019-04-30T18:53:00.298900,Sasha,"A class is ""smart data"", in that it can store things, but also knows how to do things with that data. For instance, a list is a class... it stores objects, but it also knows how to `sort()` itself."
1933,2019-04-30T18:53:34.299100,Priscilla,oh
1933,2019-04-30T18:55:48.299500,Priscilla,looking it upo
1933,2019-04-30T18:56:32.300700,Priscilla,so would i wrap a class and all functions in a for loop and let it spit out the results of each device?
1933,2019-04-30T18:56:40.301200,Priscilla,no that woudlnt work nvm
1933,2019-04-30T18:59:00.303500,Sasha,"I don't know whether you want to try it here, but the pattern might be to have a class which represents each device. It knows its own serial number, it knows how to run tests on itself, it keeps the test results as part of its own data, and when asked it can print out all of that."
1933,2019-04-30T18:59:23.303600,Priscilla,so if i under
1933,2019-04-30T19:00:27.305300,Sasha,"(There's no single ""right way"" to do what you seem to need to implement.)"
1933,2019-04-30T19:00:38.305600,Priscilla,"unfortunatly the tests are not automatted, the user will run test1 on all devices, then test2 on all, then test3 on all"
1933,2019-04-30T19:01:10.306100,Priscilla,"right, hard to break the habit of finding THE answer lol"
1933,2019-04-30T19:08:12.306600,Priscilla,i wish i could just have a placeholder in a string that populates itself. its in my brain but making it happen is not working out lol
1933,2019-04-30T19:10:51.308000,Sasha,"Can you do something like:
```results = serial_number
results += test1(serial_number)
results += test2(serial_number)
results += test3(serial_number)
print(results)```"
1933,2019-04-30T19:15:16.312200,Priscilla,yes  it is similar
1933,2019-04-30T19:19:01.312600,Priscilla,basically exactly the same actually.

1933,2019-04-30T19:29:34.314800,Priscilla,IT WORKS!
1934,2019-04-30T18:56:39.301100,Carmen,<@Shirley> Task Scheduler is as reliable as the platform you're running it on. It's the standard for running things at a specific time on Windows.
1934,2019-04-30T19:13:54.311800,Carmen,This project is sounding roughly like a piece of software I helped implement years ago for a tool calibration company. The technicians would go on-site and be calibrating individual tools. They'd have to manually do the testing on the piece of equipment (making measurements against known standards) and then record their results by typing them into the software. Is that similar to what you're doing here?

The best you can get is the owner, but that's not quite the same thing. Your stated OS directories and read-write access plan seems like a reasonable first-shot."

1936,2019-05-01T10:30:16.337300,Christina,<@Bao> i think you need to phrase your questions more indepth and less like a google query. it can be hard to help you with what is shown here
1937,2019-05-01T10:37:27.338900,Christina,why does black and pylint disagree with indents :disappointed: super annoying - here i am trying to get a perfect score
1937,2019-05-01T10:45:00.340100,Clemmie,I’m guessing it is for the indentation of wrapped lines on lines subsequent to the first. Black is _much_ more opinionated there than pylint is
1937,2019-05-01T10:47:44.340300,Christina,yep.
1937,2019-05-01T10:48:06.340800,Christina,well pylint complains about the amount of indents. i'm probably just going to edit my pylint config :stuck_out_tongue:
1937,2019-05-01T10:54:21.341100,Kori,Do any plotly experts know why this code is only plotting the line graph (trace2) and not the bar chart?  If I remove the second the second trace then I do get a bar chart.  I’m sure I’m making a silly mistake but I cannot find it.

1938,2019-05-01T11:56:38.345200,Hiroko,"gotcha, makes sense"
1938,2019-05-01T11:57:41.346200,Hiroko,not really
1938,2019-05-01T11:58:08.346800,Hiroko,`self` is an explicit identefier to the instance of the class that’s being worked on
1938,2019-05-01T11:58:28.347400,Hiroko,"in java/javascript, C#, they have an implicit `this` for class methods"
1938,2019-05-01T12:00:48.348500,Priscilla,How would you define instance?
1938,2019-05-01T12:01:38.348900,Clemmie,"when you do
```
a = A()
b = A()
```
`a` and `b` are instances of class `A()`"
1938,2019-05-01T12:02:33.350100,Clemmie,each having (potentially) different data in the `A()` structures
1938,2019-05-01T12:03:15.351400,Priscilla,Oh man. I think I just got it. So if I needed one function to do two different things with different data. I would use two instances of that one function?
1938,2019-05-01T12:03:35.352200,Priscilla,I’m trying to understand it on a less abstract level. 
1938,2019-05-01T12:03:36.352300,Clemmie,"no, function don’t have instances, only classes do"
1938,2019-05-01T12:03:44.352700,Priscilla,Oh
1938,2019-05-01T12:04:03.353100,Clemmie,if you needed a function to work on two different bits of data you would pass different params
1938,2019-05-01T12:04:57.353200,Clemmie,None
1938,2019-05-01T12:05:45.354400,Clemmie,"that is because a function doesn’t store anything, class instances do"
1938,2019-05-01T12:07:31.354700,Hiroko,"basically, think of a class as a recipe"
1938,2019-05-01T12:07:45.355200,Hiroko,"if you know how to do a recipe, you can use it to create a part of a meal"
1938,2019-05-01T12:07:53.355500,Hiroko,"but each recipe is different, isn’t it?"
1938,2019-05-01T12:08:56.356800,Hiroko,"that’s where classes have internal _state_, which can means instance A and B can have different results when you call `a.some_function()` vs `b.some_function()`"
1938,2019-05-01T12:16:12.357700,Priscilla,That makes a lot of sense. Thanks guys. Is there a way to save a convo in slack?
1938,2019-05-01T12:16:22.357900,Porsha,You can star a message
1938,2019-05-01T12:16:41.358100,Hiroko,but its not persistent
1938,2019-05-01T12:16:52.358500,Hiroko,slack free groups have a 10k message history limit
1938,2019-05-01T12:17:21.359100,Hiroko,"with the volume here, that means it exists only for about 6-8 days before they become inacessible"
1938,2019-05-01T12:18:52.359700,Priscilla,Perfect. Only needs to exist till I get off work. 
1939,2019-05-01T11:42:37.344700,Kori,I forgot to add “overlaying=‘y’” to the second axis. Oops. It all works when I do that
1939,2019-05-01T11:57:20.346000,Priscilla,"Class contains the functions

_init_ is the parameters of the class

Self applies _init_ parameters to the function within the class.

Is this a correct understanding?"
1940,2019-05-01T12:59:29.360000,Emerita,Noted. And thx.
1941,2019-05-01T13:20:46.361000,Christina,You could also screenshot it. But :star2: is probably best
1941,2019-05-01T13:22:40.362100,Arcelia,Hi everyone: I have an ID that looks like: 8A8E06A4 in a log file but I'm pretty confident it needs to map to an integer. Anyone recognise the data format or has any clue how I can figure it out?
1941,2019-05-01T13:22:57.362400,Christina,It could be a HEX.?
1941,2019-05-01T13:23:46.363700,Christina,"`Int('8A8E06A4', 16)` will convert it to base10"
1941,2019-05-01T13:24:10.364000,Arcelia,what's the 16 parameter?
1941,2019-05-01T13:25:26.366300,Clemmie,make an int from base 16
1941,2019-05-01T13:26:03.367500,Christina,"So hexadecimal is another numbering system (basically) binary is base2. (0, 1). Decimal (what you know) is base10 (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) and hexadecimal is base16 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F)"
1941,2019-05-01T13:26:52.368300,Arcelia,"awesome, it gave me a number indeed, I'll try and see if it matches anything in my output file"
1941,2019-05-01T13:28:31.369200,Sasha,"A number like that beginning with 8 or above could also be negative signed integer, so keep an eye out for that possibility."
1941,2019-05-01T13:29:45.369400,Arcelia,they all start with 8
1941,2019-05-01T13:30:01.369700,Arcelia,googling negative signed int :slightly_smiling_face:
1941,2019-05-01T13:30:27.370100,Arcelia,in fact they all look like 8A8F8F54 0000002E
1941,2019-05-01T13:30:32.370400,Arcelia,the last part is always identical
1941,2019-05-01T13:30:39.370700,Arcelia,the 0..2E
1941,2019-05-01T13:30:40.370800,Sasha,It would be -1970403676 in that format. But unlikely if they're all like that.
1941,2019-05-01T13:31:18.371400,Arcelia,well the positive version of that actually makes sense from what I can see in the output
1941,2019-05-01T13:31:59.371800,Arcelia,"nope, also not it"
1941,2019-05-01T13:33:47.372600,Arcelia,it should somehow map to a number in the neighbourhood of
1941,2019-05-01T13:33:48.372800,Arcelia,#199894184063
1941,2019-05-01T13:33:54.373200,Arcelia,minus the hashtag
1941,2019-05-01T13:34:25.373700,Arcelia,anywhere within a a few hundred below or above that number
1941,2019-05-01T13:35:15.374400,Sasha,"The `2E` is the most significant byte there. Try `int('0000002E8A8F8F54', 16)`"
1941,2019-05-01T13:35:49.374700,Arcelia,gets me 199893059156
1941,2019-05-01T13:35:59.374900,Arcelia,that looks seriously promising!
1941,2019-05-01T13:37:17.375300,Arcelia,that might be it but I still can't find that exact number in there
1941,2019-05-01T13:37:30.375700,Arcelia,they might be trying to obfuscate the number
1941,2019-05-01T13:37:40.376000,Arcelia,there purposely isn't any documentation on this available
1941,2019-05-01T13:37:53.376300,Arcelia,so I'm flying blind here
1941,2019-05-01T13:38:22.376600,Sasha,199894184063 would be 8A9F307F 0000002E in that format if that helps.
1941,2019-05-01T13:38:56.377000,Arcelia,looking that up in the log file but no hits
1941,2019-05-01T13:39:19.377500,Arcelia,would it be ok if we took this private and only report final solution or failure here EdKeyes?
1941,2019-05-01T13:39:36.377700,Sasha,"Sure, happy to have a closer look."
1941,2019-05-01T13:51:22.378200,Christina,<@Arcelia> just out of curiosity can you share what you are working on?

1942,2019-05-01T14:13:22.383500,Elwanda,None
1942,2019-05-01T14:14:39.384900,Christina,You are asking for input. Are you supplying that? And I assume you have to print it as well if you want output. If that is all your code
1942,2019-05-01T14:15:03.385300,Elwanda,yeah

1942,2019-05-01T23:56:32.404100,Donna,Got it!
1942,2019-05-01T23:57:03.404300,Donna,here's the goal
1942,2019-05-01T23:57:09.404500,Donna,"You'll want to write a Python program to:
(1) for each of the first five links read the html text content of each website (that is to say, read the three character ""code"" for each),
(2) concatenate the five parts together in order (first website part + second website part + ...),
(3) append the resulting 15 character ""code"" to the validation url in the place of the string ""&lt;clock pts&gt;"", and
(4) read the html text content of the website with the derived url."
1942,2019-05-01T23:59:25.404700,Donna,None
1942,2019-05-01T23:59:56.405200,Donna,That's how far i got.
1942,2019-05-02T00:00:56.406000,Mildred,"not my strong suit, but i would imagine you have to do something with webscaping, probably the request module"
1942,2019-05-02T00:01:42.407100,Sasha,"Yep, I'd say your next step is reading some of the documentation for the `requests` library."
1942,2019-05-02T00:01:48.407300,Mildred,"something like:

For each in urls:
    text.append(request(url[each])"
1942,2019-05-02T00:02:45.408200,Sasha,"A simple issue that will probably catch you by surprise is that you need commas between your URLs to make a list, as right now the strings will be appended into one large one."
1942,2019-05-02T00:11:30.408400,Donna,None
1942,2019-05-02T00:12:27.409300,Donna,Here is one of my first trys an hour ago.
1942,2019-05-02T00:13:23.409800,Sasha,Cool. Did that work?
1942,2019-05-02T00:13:57.410600,Donna,"Yes, but I need to all all 5 links and responses, then concat all of them"
1942,2019-05-02T00:14:31.411100,Sasha,I'm not sure how much of a beginner you are. Are you familiar with `for` loops?
1942,2019-05-02T00:16:32.412100,Donna,"I'll say I know nothing. Like watched 10 videos, fresh off the python boat."
1942,2019-05-02T00:17:09.412600,Donna,Read this: <https://realpython.com/python-requests/>
1942,2019-05-02T00:17:36.413500,Mildred,"i would be suprosed if you didnt know loops after watching 10 videos.

Outside of what a variable is, its right up on the list"
1942,2019-05-02T00:18:30.414400,Sasha,"Okay, the simplest form of a `for` loop allows you to repeat a section of code for a sequence of values. For instance:
```nums = [1, 2, 3]
for x in nums:
  print(x)```
would output:
```1
2
3```"
1942,2019-05-02T00:19:01.414900,Sasha,So you can use this to execute your `requests` code for each URL in your list.
1942,2019-05-02T00:19:44.415600,Sasha,"Appending strings together just uses the `+` operator, like `""a"" + ""b""` produces `""ab""`."
1942,2019-05-02T00:21:24.417100,Sasha,I feel that I should tell you that the cybersecurity program you're enrolled in is likely to get exponentially more difficult than this sort of initial exercise.
1942,2019-05-02T00:23:05.418000,Donna,"Correct but this task outside of my normal ""work"""

1942,2019-05-02T00:24:31.419000,Sasha,Gotcha.
1942,2019-05-02T00:28:03.422100,Conchita,"`for` loops are important to understand. Haven't seen exactly this video, but each time I watch a Corey Schafer tutorial I feel I go from being painfully ignorant about a topic (ie TDD) and 15 minutes later, I understand the basic concepts.

1948,2019-05-02T00:53:08.424200,Yolande,"Hello everyone, 

In my react frontend I used axios to send POST request when user click log in.

In backend, while authenticating user using django I set cookie using response.set_cookie['token'] =token where token is JWT and return response. I have printed the cookie in diango and it shows me the Set_Cookie variable on django console. It is confirm that cookie has been set successfully. 

But when I see the network section in browser on localhost:3000 it doesn't show cookie.

I also printed the response as a result in react on console. It also doesn't show any cookie variable in response object.

How to resolve this problem? I stucked here. Lot of work to do.

Thanks and Regards."

1950,2019-05-02T05:57:27.429900,Rayford,oAuth is good when you want to delegeate user permission for multiple apps. In this case I have only two - desktop and react native - so I think it's an over kill

maybe it’s a dumb question, but do you know if it is possible to use a shared `__init__.py` file across modules?"
1954,2019-05-02T10:06:15.446600,Hiroko,"an `__init__.py` file just says to the interpreter that “hey, this is a python package, not a regular directory/folder” and allows for imports"
1954,2019-05-02T10:07:23.447700,Hiroko,"if you have logic in `__init__.py` that you want shared, pull it out into a `something.py` file and you can import it into modules"
1954,2019-05-02T10:13:23.450700,Alicia,"hi <@Hiroko>,
I thought that __init__.py could also be used to execute some logic at module import phase, as the first action…

In particular my logic is the following:

```
# This piece of code is needed to fix a bug in matplotlib on MacOs
# see: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21784641/installation-issue-with-matplotlib-python>
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
if sys.platform == 'darwin':
    import matplotlib

    if 'matplotlib' in sys.modules:
        matplotlib.use('TkAgg')
```

so what you say is that I should move that in a specific python file, and then import that file in every module?"
1954,2019-05-02T10:15:58.451700,Bethany,I think the kind of thing you're showing here is ok. It's basically import configuration
1954,2019-05-02T10:17:01.453200,Bethany,Matplotlib has to do this kind of stuff since it depends on system renderers/drawers/whatever it's called
1954,2019-05-02T10:17:05.453300,Hiroko,:yep:
1954,2019-05-02T10:17:54.453700,Chester,"```
    import matplotlib

   if 'matplotlib' in sys.modules:
```
This `if` seems useless"
1954,2019-05-02T10:18:29.453800,Alicia,yeah probably :smile:
1954,2019-05-02T10:19:11.454100,Alicia,they call them backends
1954,2019-05-02T10:21:15.455100,Bethany,Are you asking to repeat this logic everywhere matplotlib is imported?
1954,2019-05-02T10:26:07.456000,Chester,"I usually have a `main` function which i call in
```
if __name__ == '__main__':

1954,2019-05-02T10:26:18.456400,Chester,I'd put that matplotlib configuration in there

1973,2019-05-03T17:34:06.499600,Hiroko,you’re conflating query params with url parameters
1973,2019-05-03T17:34:38.000300,Hiroko,"`?id=...` is a query param, which doesn’t work directly with a `RetrieveAPIView`"
1973,2019-05-03T17:35:20.001000,Hiroko,you’d have to remove the `(?P&lt;id&gt;[0-9]+)/` from the url config and check for the query param in `get_queryset`

I'm running a multiprocessing pool script in django, when I submit a form it processes it in the multiprocessing pool script then returns a result.

The problem is, whenever I run the script twice in django view it keeps appending the result.

It's as if the process refuses to terminate before running another one. 

How can I do this? "

1977,2019-05-04T11:11:02.016400,Libby,"any command that you give, needs to have its original full path in PATH for it to work on command line in one single word."

`&gt;&gt; C&gt; Program Files &gt; my software &gt; python  --version` it will give you the version, which means you are initialising it using full path to the exact location"
1977,2019-05-04T11:13:35.019300,Libby,"in order to short cut that whole directory structure, we add it to the PATH, and then use one keyword to symbolize the whole path(C&gt; Program Files &gt; my software &gt; python)."

1980,2019-05-04T17:09:17.027200,Priscilla,oops
1980,2019-05-04T17:33:50.028400,Priscilla,"ok, i updated with code calling the functions, and an equally confusing error code"
1980,2019-05-04T18:27:00.029200,Priscilla,"still get error
`AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'check_power_flags'`"
1980,2019-05-04T18:31:27.031500,Priscilla,ok im giving that a shot
1980,2019-05-04T18:38:06.033600,Priscilla,"oh yeah, i copy and pasted that from older work i think"
1980,2019-05-04T18:50:35.037200,Priscilla,i just realised each device will have its own com port to send data to/from
1980,2019-05-04T18:51:33.037900,Priscilla,crap lol i should have realised that earlier
1980,2019-05-04T18:55:14.038600,Priscilla,wait a minute... how can you write/read from 30 com ports on one machine? can a pc even do that?
1980,2019-05-04T18:56:35.039300,Priscilla,holy crap my pc has 256 com ports available... so i guess it can.
1980,2019-05-04T19:05:56.041200,Sasha,"It may become difficult to know which serial is attached to which com port. So if there's any way to read off the serial number from the device itself, you might consider that."
1980,2019-05-04T19:08:41.041900,Priscilla,"maybe when putting in serial numbers, those serial number become the name of the com ports, since its just a variable."
1980,2019-05-04T19:10:45.042500,Priscilla,yes
1980,2019-05-04T19:11:01.042900,Sasha,So if you don't know which hardware is plugged into which com port...
1980,2019-05-04T19:11:20.043100,Priscilla,oh yeah
1980,2019-05-04T19:15:55.045400,Priscilla,"But i do know how many ports, and I will be allowed to define the order of inputting serial numbers. So if com ports 1-3 all apply to the first serial number and 4-6 apply to the second serial number, and so on until 10 serial numbers."
1980,2019-05-04T19:16:54.046600,Sasha,"Depends on how the com ports get assigned, I guess."
1980,2019-05-04T19:17:09.046900,Priscilla,so then I need it to run this class on the first serial number (on each 3 ports within that class) and then iterate to the next serial number
1980,2019-05-04T19:17:18.047100,Priscilla,what do you mean?
1980,2019-05-04T19:18:42.048700,Sasha,"Well, if these are USB devices, the com ports would typically get dynamically assigned based on the order that things are plugged in, or discovered. If this is some special-purpose machine with 30 RS-232 ports on expansion cards, then the ports would probably correspond 1:1 with the physical connectors. I'm not sure what kind of devices you're dealing with."
1980,2019-05-04T19:20:27.049800,Priscilla,"im sorry, the comports will not change, its usb to rs232 and the usb will stay in at all times with the rs232 only changing, and the pc doesnt even register that"
1980,2019-05-04T19:20:43.050300,Priscilla,"com ports are static in this scenario, thank god lol"
1980,2019-05-04T19:21:36.050800,Sasha,Gotcha. Just watch out for everything being maybe scrambled when you reboot.
1980,2019-05-04T19:21:55.051000,Priscilla,good point
1980,2019-05-04T19:23:23.052500,Priscilla,"so then I could apply the serial numbers to a list, that list has 3 of the com ports and then within the class itterate the function through the list of serial numbers."
1980,2019-05-04T19:24:05.053400,Priscilla,no outside of the class I would itterate serial numbers and within the class itterate com ports by 3
1980,2019-05-04T19:25:18.053900,Sasha,"Each class instance would want to know its own serial number and the 3 ports it uses, yeah."
1980,2019-05-04T20:20:27.055000,Priscilla,":neutral_face: idk how to do this should i make a list within the `__init__` function so it is with the list of serial number, and test data?"
1980,2019-05-04T20:37:43.055400,Priscilla,(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ does not work
1981,2019-05-04T18:29:49.030300,Sasha,"So, doing `BurnIn.report(s)` is calling the `report()` method on the class itself, rather than an initialized object, so `self` is being set to `s`, a string."
1981,2019-05-04T18:30:18.030900,Sasha,"You probably want something like:
```device = BurnIn(s)
print(device.report())```"
1981,2019-05-04T18:32:47.032900,Sasha,"I'll also note that *once again* you are assigning `None` to a variable from the return value of `print()`. I highly recommend you get into the habit of searching for ""= print"" in your code and eliminating it wherever you find it, as it is *always wrong*."
1981,2019-05-04T18:41:45.035200,Sasha,"Your `check_power_flags()` function should probably be using `self.` to access the serial number and test data, instead of being passed those as arguments."
1981,2019-05-04T18:48:52.036000,Priscilla,"thats a good point, this gets me to my next step, thank you sir"
1982,2019-05-04T19:01:45.039600,Sasha,"Are these USB-connected devices, I assume?"
1982,2019-05-04T19:09:48.042300,Sasha,"Well, I presume that eventually you will want to match up the test results to the actual hardware being tested?"
1983,2019-05-04T23:24:43.056400,Conchita,What is the cheapest method for creating an empty bytes variable?
1983,2019-05-04T23:25:52.057500,Conchita,"The system I'm working with requires it, and speed is of the essence so want to reduce resources spent on it"
1983,2019-05-04T23:26:47.058300,Conchita,`current_best_option = b''`
1983,2019-05-04T23:34:46.059000,Sasha,"I wouldn't have expected much variation there, but `bytes()` does seem noticeably slower than the literal form."
1983,2019-05-04T23:35:37.060000,Sasha,"However, do note that bytes variables are immutable, so you really only have to create one, and use it repeatedly."
1983,2019-05-04T23:53:10.061100,Conchita,"Got it, will go with `current_best_option = b''` then"
1983,2019-05-05T01:40:33.063200,Chester,<@Conchita> are you sure that creating an empty bytes object is the most resourceful operation?
1983,2019-05-05T01:40:36.063400,Chester,I am very doubt about that

I use `source = request.args.get(""source"")` to get the parameter. I need to pass all these parameters to a function. Any advice on how to do this?"
1986,2019-05-05T04:26:59.073800,Conchita,Is this where I need to use *args and/or **kwargs?
1986,2019-05-05T04:28:26.075200,Conchita,"Just to make it clear the end goal here is to pass all the parameters to a list. This will be executed by a function, so I will need to pass these parameters as arguments to a function"

The array of `target`, is of type `&lt;set&gt;`. I need to pass string values only. I thought `signal = json.dumps(signal)` would convert it all to string, but it seems not. Any advice on how to store the function arguments in the `target` array like string, or convert to string?"
1987,2019-05-05T05:13:50.081900,Chester,Why it is a set?
1987,2019-05-05T05:14:51.082500,Conchita,I'm not sure. I just ran `print(type(signal['target']))` and got `&lt;class 'set'&gt;`
1987,2019-05-05T05:15:28.082900,Chester,"Well, you specified it. `{foo, bar, baz}` is for making sets."

1987,2019-05-05T05:27:52.089700,Chester,I don't know how your frontend processes that value so I don't have the answer
1987,2019-05-05T09:01:32.092000,Ashley,"<@Conchita> a set is basically a list. The only difference is that a set only allows ""hashable"" things, and it only allows things with unique hashes. Basically, it's a list that prevents duplicates"
1987,2019-05-05T09:06:33.095100,Ashley,I don't think the web development community ever came to a conclusion on how to handle this in a unified fashion. I would use the `requests` library and create a simple request where you pass a dict to the `params` argument with one value being a list of stuff
1987,2019-05-05T09:06:50.095600,Ashley,You can then look at how it handled it
1987,2019-05-05T09:09:22.100000,Clemmie,"Sets also follow the mathematics of set theory, and provide operators from that domain - union, intersection, distinction, etc"
1987,2019-05-05T09:09:29.100300,Ashley,"So something like this:

```
r = requests.get(""<https://google.com>"", params={""a"": 3, ""b"": [""xyz"", ""abc""]})
print (r.request.url)
```"
1987,2019-05-05T09:09:51.100800,Ashley,That too. Comes in handy for a lot of things

1987,2019-05-05T09:16:11.105900,Ashley,"<@Conchita> what you're looking at is called the ""query string"", and there's already libraries built in that know how to parse it if it's incoming(urllib), or third party ones that can generate the URL for requests you want to make (requests), so I wouldn't try to reinvent the wheel there. But I would keep in mind that different frontend frameworks will handle it different ways"

1988,2019-05-05T10:40:31.111500,Ena,<@Jettie> my tutorial stated that quantifiers tell the regex engine to match a certain quantity of characters. it as stated that examples of quantifers where: ? which uses 0 or 1 times to match characters.
1988,2019-05-05T10:42:25.113300,Jettie,"right, so
`?` means that ""something"" can either occur once, or not at all
`*` means that ""something"" can occur in any amount, or not at all
and `{M, N}` means that it can occur between M and N times"
1988,2019-05-05T10:43:02.114100,Jettie,"like `a{2,3}` works for `aa` and `aaa`, but not `a` or `aaaa`"

1988,2019-05-05T10:46:09.118600,Hiroko,"<@Bart> it basically calls the function `reverse` on all items in an array. What the implementation of `reverse`, and how the code is called are hard to say with the given context "

I'd like to first create a map and outline several communities within a metropolitan area. Then, enter demographic data (mostly using ACS data) for each of the communities and write a program that allows a user to select and/or rate important neighborhood characteristics and have it return some kind of visualization that represents which neighborhood would be a best fit (or top 3). Is this something that can be done in Python? I've been experimenting with matplotlib and geopandas, but am constantly learning about new libraries to use (want to try cenpy next). I know there are programs that already do this (ESRI live, work, locate) but I want to recreate this type of program to help myself learn. ANY tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!!

1997,2019-05-06T05:26:01.152200,Dawn,"Hey guys, I'm relatively new to Python. I guess I know the basics and I can write some code - but just started with design patterns etc.

Currently I'm working on an ETL project in which we take JSON files and send them into an Azure database. Each JSON has its own custom mapping of fields to Azure tables and columns. So I'm working with one big json_mapper.py file which has a bunch of if/elif/else statements to check which mapping has to be used.

As I understand, this would be a good situation for a factory method. I'd like to refactor this to a nice and clean method, but to be honest I don't really know where to start. I've done some reading into factory methods, but the custom mapping per JSON, which is sometimes very custom, is the hardest part for me. I'm not really sure where to put that etc.

Does anyone have any pointers for me? A direction to where I should / could start?"
1997,2019-05-06T05:26:46.152800,Chester,<@Dawn> can you show a sample from your code?
1997,2019-05-06T05:27:45.153800,Dawn,"yeah sure. There's a json which has feedback question objects, and in those question objects there are also answer objects. So this is an example where those questions and answers are split out into two mssql tables. Prepare for ugly code"
1997,2019-05-06T05:28:01.153900,Dawn,None
1997,2019-05-06T05:28:23.154600,Dawn,"this is a snippet of the mapper, which gets called by a general 'transfer' script. it gets the mssql_connection and a list of docs as parameters from the parent script"
1997,2019-05-06T05:30:24.155300,Dawn,"and well it actually works fine, it's just ugly because there's like 30 custom mappings and it's only becoming more"

1997,2019-05-06T05:39:47.162600,Chester,"<@Dawn> okay, so you think your code is ugly mostly because it violates the single responsibility principle, a lot :slightly_smiling_face:
I see thee different blocks of code that should be extracted into their own functions:
1) `doc`, `question` and `answers` parsing logic - some fields are optional, some fields need to be converted, etc.
2) mapping between parsed `doc` fields and `target` fields
3) I/O, data insertion into the database"
1997,2019-05-06T05:47:18.165800,Chester,"Once you extract parsing logic into its own function, you'll be able to implement mapping as a static dictionary"
1997,2019-05-06T05:48:42.167300,Chester,"e.g.
```
MAPPED_FIELDS = {
    '_id': 'ID',
    'createdAt': 'CreatedAt',
    ...
}
mapped = {}
for key, value in parsed_doc.items():
    mapped_key = MAPPED_FIELDS[key]
    mapped[mapped_key] = value
```"
1997,2019-05-06T05:49:16.168000,Chester,"viola, you now have a generic mapper function that only needs a mapping dictionary as input"
1997,2019-05-06T05:51:52.168100,Dawn,"Looks nice, thanks"
1998,2019-05-06T06:29:52.168400,Leida,"first, we dont know where the text comes from - im assuming you can get it line by line"
1998,2019-05-06T06:31:15.168600,Leida,"you dont need to get the shard if the ip is wrong so on each line you can call ```if ""10.65.41.35"" in line:```"
1998,2019-05-06T06:31:35.168800,Leida,where `line` is the variable that contains the line of text
1998,2019-05-06T06:33:46.169000,Leida,next up you could get the location of the substring using the `find()` function
1998,2019-05-06T06:34:13.169200,Leida,"something like ```line.find(""_shard"")```"
1998,2019-05-06T06:35:41.169400,Leida,that would give you the index for the _ character
1998,2019-05-06T06:36:32.169600,Leida,if you add 6 to it you should have the index for the shard number
1998,2019-05-06T06:38:04.169800,Leida,"if you know there are less than 10 shards then you could just get the character from that location, if it can be longer then then you should search for the next occurance of _ and subtracting 1 from the index of it to get the index of the last number, then anything between those two is the shard number"
1998,2019-05-06T06:38:16.170000,Leida,is the shard number even what you are looking for?
1998,2019-05-06T06:43:42.170200,Lanelle,<@Leida> sure what would be the snippet
1998,2019-05-06T06:46:01.170400,Leida,"```
if ""10.65.41.35"" in line:
  index = line.find(""_shard"")
  shard_number = line[index+6]```"
1998,2019-05-06T06:47:04.170600,Leida,you can get an error if line is shorter than `index + 6` tho
1998,2019-05-06T06:50:26.170800,Lanelle,"are u going to also  have
```f=open('file','r')
line=f.readlines()```"
1998,2019-05-06T06:52:12.171000,Leida,`with open(“filename”) as file: `
1998,2019-05-06T06:52:53.171200,Leida,"```
with open(""filename"") as file:
  for line in file:
    if ""10.65.41.35"" in line:
      index = line.find(""_shard"")
      shard_number = line[index+6]```"
1998,2019-05-06T06:58:52.171900,Leida,"you can add checking if `_shard` was found (find returns -1 if not found) and check the length of line before you try to use an index on it and well maybe replace the 6 with `len(""_shard"")` so that there are no magic numbers"
1998,2019-05-06T07:12:47.178900,Jamey,"I would like some help clarifying if I have a correct data model. My end goal is to have something that allows users to create their own data models for risks.

1998,2019-05-06T07:17:23.182500,Dawn,"Thanks, but with this there's still the problem of nested objects. I have a lot of those and they all look different. Sometimes it's even a nested doc in a nested doc in an array in a nested doc..."
1998,2019-05-06T07:17:51.183100,Chester,I can rephrase: what would this api give me that a sticky notes app doesn't have?
1998,2019-05-06T07:18:27.183200,Chester,Write a separate parser/mapper for each nested doc.
1998,2019-05-06T07:34:41.185200,Jamey,It gives me a use case where I write code that demonstrates my abilities to write an API using DRF. :slightly_smiling_face:

1998,2019-05-06T07:35:58.187300,Chester,Maybe a JSONB field is easier to work with if your schema isn't strictly defined
1998,2019-05-06T07:36:19.187800,Chester,ER diagram only makes sense for strictly defined schemas
1998,2019-05-06T07:36:34.188200,Jamey,I was just asking to make sure I had the relationships laid out correctly.
1998,2019-05-06T07:37:34.189300,Jamey,"The idea is that it should be strictly defined, yes. Or at least that's what is implied by asking for a ER diagram to go along with your classes."

2000,2019-05-06T08:37:59.193400,Jonas,"In a previous project we approached this with a `Question` model, which had a question and a response type"
2000,2019-05-06T08:38:23.194000,Jonas,What we did was make the `Question` class store a JSON field of form keyword arguments
2000,2019-05-06T08:38:44.194500,Jonas,"Then, from a given `Question` you can construct a form field with the 'right' validations and types"
2000,2019-05-06T08:38:58.194900,Jonas,"And, given `n` questions, you have a `Form` you can validate against"

2001,2019-05-06T09:31:31.202900,Holly,might be `network-manager`

2001,2019-05-06T09:32:17.203800,Holly,you can also double check in I believe `/etc/init.d/` with something like `ls /etc/init.d | grep -i network`
2001,2019-05-06T09:42:56.204300,Elmira,Okay I will try it

2001,2019-05-06T10:06:53.217600,Clemmie,`Counter` is a special dict type that maintains a counter as the var for all the keys that it sees. This uses a list comprehension to extract the names out of your dict and instantiate/populate a Counter with them
2001,2019-05-06T10:07:14.218200,Christa,Hey all
2001,2019-05-06T10:07:25.218500,Clemmie,Then it uses the `sum` function with a list comprehension to sum the list of values (counts) that are greater than 1

2002,2019-05-06T14:10:59.235200,Nenita,"yea, dict is called from a function but ill be changing along with so much more, but atm setting to this is what causes the error."

2003,2019-05-06T13:10:02.232300,Sasha,Can you show an example? The `\W` should already be removing quotes within the string.
2004,2019-05-06T14:30:18.240800,Nenita,what kind of casing is proper/preferred for dictionary keys?
2004,2019-05-06T14:31:43.241300,Damien,"is all the keys come from code, lower, with underscores for words"
2004,2019-05-06T14:33:07.241600,Hiroko,"basically, `snake_case`"

2007,2019-05-06T18:11:06.253100,Gemma,"Firstly, I would try to get the encoding if possible from which you can supply `.decode()` with an `encoding=blahblah` argument. You can also supply an `errors=ignore`, which will skip over bad bytes and from this you may be able to get a sense for what the encoding is."

app/facenet/src/...
app/facenet/align/...
app/src/application.py

2012,2019-05-07T09:57:13.272600,Leida,there is a project that has pretty much the same layout and it does `from facenet.src.align import detect_face` and i guess it works(?)
2012,2019-05-07T09:58:33.273500,Leida,"there are `__init__.py` files in src, facenet, facenet/src, facenet/align"
2012,2019-05-07T09:59:44.274200,Leida,i tired adding `__init__.py` to app too to no avail
2012,2019-05-07T10:05:56.275100,Ashley,What does your import look like?
2012,2019-05-07T10:07:08.276300,Leida,i tried `from facenet.src import facenet` and `from .facenet.src import facenet` and `from ..facenet.src import facenet`
2012,2019-05-07T10:07:37.277700,Leida,added `__init__.py` to app to make it a module and tried a few variations and still didnt get it right xD

2012,2019-05-07T10:08:54.279800,Ashley,So the other package is able to do an absolute import because python understands it's all a package. It sounds like that won't work for you because you don't have an actual package yet that Python would recognize
2012,2019-05-07T10:10:23.280900,Ashley,"When you do `from .facenet`, you're saying ""from my current package level"", but there is no facenet package inside facenet/src"
2012,2019-05-07T10:11:48.282400,Ashley,You don't need to reference the facenet package though. You just need to get to a namespace that has what you want. So you just need to go another level up with `..`
2012,2019-05-07T10:13:40.283000,Leida,"but that returns ```   from ..facenet.src import facenet

2012,2019-05-07T10:16:20.285500,Leida,the example im looking at does not have init in the main app folder
2012,2019-05-07T10:17:10.286800,Leida,the script is in `app/src`
2012,2019-05-07T10:17:17.287300,Leida,im running it from `app`
2012,2019-05-07T10:17:32.287900,Marth,<@Jung> I think you're looking to do something like `df2 = df.dropna(subset=['emails'])`
2012,2019-05-07T10:17:33.288100,Leida,as `python src/application.py args`
2012,2019-05-07T10:17:49.288400,Clemmie,so in python3 you don’t always need an `init` but the time you do/don’t are fairly confusing
2012,2019-05-07T10:18:31.288600,Ashley,"ah, i just reread the file names"
2012,2019-05-07T10:21:21.289100,Ashley,I also forgot about the implicit namespace packages
2012,2019-05-07T10:25:56.289700,Ashley,looks like the only time you need the `__init__.py` is if it wouldn't be empty
2012,2019-05-07T10:26:32.290500,Ashley,<@Leida> try running that command from another directory up (with the right file location)
2012,2019-05-07T10:26:56.290800,Leida,with which import?
2012,2019-05-07T10:27:17.291000,Ashley,from ..facenet.src import ...
2012,2019-05-07T10:28:21.291300,Leida,"```  File ""app/src/application.py"", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    from ..facenet.src import facenet
ValueError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package
```"
2012,2019-05-07T10:28:39.291500,Ashley,hmmmm
2012,2019-05-07T10:28:54.291900,Leida,with ```python app/src/application.py args```
2012,2019-05-07T10:28:59.292100,Ashley,is the `__init__.py` in app/?
2012,2019-05-07T10:29:20.292500,Leida,removed right now
2012,2019-05-07T10:29:31.292900,Ashley,try adding it and running it again
2012,2019-05-07T10:29:46.293400,Leida,same result
2012,2019-05-07T10:29:51.293600,Ashley,hmmm
2012,2019-05-07T10:30:05.293900,Ashley,try removing any cache files
2012,2019-05-07T10:30:59.294200,Leida,including in facenet?
2012,2019-05-07T10:31:12.294500,Leida,removing from app/src left with the same result
2012,2019-05-07T10:31:46.295000,Leida,i have a bunch of `facenet` folders around the app folder tho
2012,2019-05-07T10:32:52.295900,Leida,"like ```../facenet/facenet/facenet/src/
../app/facenet/src```"
2012,2019-05-07T10:32:54.296200,Ashley,everywhere in app/
2012,2019-05-07T10:33:16.297100,Ashley,"oh, not those"
2012,2019-05-07T10:33:17.297300,Leida,i have a similar project in the folder outside of app folder
2012,2019-05-07T10:33:20.297400,Clemmie,you might want to rethink your naming - that is going to get (is?) really confusing
2012,2019-05-07T10:33:22.297600,Ashley,I mean `__pycache__` folders
2012,2019-05-07T10:33:34.297900,Ashley,"also, yeah"
2012,2019-05-07T10:33:36.298100,Leida,the naming is sorta wip xD
2012,2019-05-07T10:33:58.298700,Leida,problem is i pulled a project that wraps facenet and is called facenet which has a module of facenet xD
2012,2019-05-07T10:34:30.299300,Ashley,you can use the `__init__.py` to clean that up nicely
2012,2019-05-07T10:35:13.300200,Leida,dont see any more `__pychache__` folders using find in app folder
2012,2019-05-07T10:35:56.300700,Ashley,"in the `__init__.py` in the top level of `facenet/`, you can basically control what the namespace is of the `facenet` package"
2012,2019-05-07T10:36:47.301600,Ashley,"so if you do `import facenet`, you don't have to do `facenet.src.facenet.thing`. You can just do `facenet.thing`"
2012,2019-05-07T10:37:00.301900,Ashley,any cache folders in any of the subdirectories?
2012,2019-05-07T10:38:08.302300,Leida,"hmm using tree i did find some chaches, ill remove em"
2012,2019-05-07T10:40:08.302900,Leida,still same result
2012,2019-05-07T10:40:38.303200,Leida,some problem with pyenv maybe?
2012,2019-05-07T10:41:25.303800,Leida,im in a pyenv but the vim i run uses a different version of python for linting for example
2012,2019-05-07T10:42:05.304400,Ashley,ah
2012,2019-05-07T10:42:06.304600,Ashley,try this
2012,2019-05-07T10:42:28.305100,Ashley,"activate your venv (if it isn't already active), and run `pip freeze`"
2012,2019-05-07T10:43:31.305800,Ashley,"that shouldn't reveal any problems, but doesn't hurt to check"
2012,2019-05-07T10:43:57.306300,Leida,you mean to check if there are any facenets in there?
2012,2019-05-07T10:44:07.306500,Ashley,"yeah, or any other oddities"
2012,2019-05-07T10:44:56.307300,Leida,None
2012,2019-05-07T10:46:02.308400,Ashley,hmm
2012,2019-05-07T10:46:17.308800,Ashley,"so just to be clear, you basically have this going on, right?

```
app/
    __init__.py
    facenet/
        __init__.py
        src/
            __init__.py
            something.py
        align/
            __init__.py
            detect_face.py
    src/
        __init__.py
        application.py
```"
2012,2019-05-07T10:47:05.309100,Leida,yep thats it
2012,2019-05-07T10:47:23.309800,Leida,altho facenet is the whole of the facenet repo so there are more thing in there
2012,2019-05-07T10:47:36.310000,Ashley,"and you're in the parent directory of `app/`, correct?"
2012,2019-05-07T10:47:53.310400,Leida,currently one up from that
2012,2019-05-07T10:48:18.310700,Ashley,"so if you `ls`, you wont see `app/`?"
2012,2019-05-07T10:48:34.311000,Leida,ah sry misread
2012,2019-05-07T10:48:41.311400,Leida,yes parent of `app/`
2012,2019-05-07T10:48:44.311600,Ashley,ok cool
2012,2019-05-07T10:48:51.311900,Ashley,and your venv is active?
2012,2019-05-07T10:49:10.312400,Leida,pyenv but not venv
2012,2019-05-07T10:49:24.312700,Ashley,venv is just short for virtual environment
2012,2019-05-07T10:49:42.313100,Ashley,there's a bunch of tools for managing one
2012,2019-05-07T10:49:48.313400,Ashley,but same concept
2012,2019-05-07T10:50:06.314000,Ashley,"also, you're running `python app/src/application.py some args`?"
2012,2019-05-07T10:50:31.314500,Leida,"i installed a separate python version before starting to mess with the project and i set that python version in the pyenv, so i can use the same packages jumping from one project to another"
2012,2019-05-07T10:50:34.314800,Leida,some args yes
2012,2019-05-07T10:51:49.316100,Leida,the args are paths to files outside of the project tho
2012,2019-05-07T10:52:15.317100,Leida,"didnt copy over my test data, rather gave them as inputs to my script with extra relative pathing"
2012,2019-05-07T10:52:31.317500,Ashley,"just a heads up regarding the virtual envs, they install a duplicate of the python binary you tell them, and that duplicate will point to it's own site-packages folder (so it has it's own set of packages ""installed"" there, and it doesn't utilize any pacakges from the copy of python it was duplicated from)"
2012,2019-05-07T10:52:45.318200,Ashley,so you don't have to go out of your way to install another copy of python yourself
2012,2019-05-07T10:52:51.318400,Ashley,it bassically does that for you
2012,2019-05-07T10:53:03.318700,Ashley,not sure if that's what you meant though
2012,2019-05-07T10:53:23.319300,Ashley,"but anyway, it sounds like that should work then"
2012,2019-05-07T10:53:53.320000,Leida,"ok, well i guess ill create a virtualenv for that porject, try with only the needed packages and see what happens"
2012,2019-05-07T10:54:04.320200,Ashley,worth a shot
2012,2019-05-07T10:54:13.320500,Ashley,I'll try my own little experiment to see what it does
2012,2019-05-07T10:55:01.321200,Leida,thanks alot for taking your time walking me through this <@Ashley> :taco:
2012,2019-05-07T10:57:39.321400,Ashley,no problem
2012,2019-05-07T10:57:48.321800,Ashley,"also, I can recreate it"
2012,2019-05-07T10:57:51.322000,Ashley,so you're not alone
2012,2019-05-07T10:58:40.323000,Ashley,"I'm guessing that because you're passing python `app/src/application.py`, it only cares about `application.py`'s immediate folder"
2012,2019-05-07T10:59:34.323300,Ashley,I'm gonna try something
2012,2019-05-07T11:00:11.323900,Leida,there was something about trying to run the file as a module somewhere on stackexchange but i didnt get far with it
2012,2019-05-07T11:04:09.324100,Ashley,interesting
2012,2019-05-07T11:04:12.324300,Ashley,"```
$ python app/thing.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""app/thing.py"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    from .src import application
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '__main__.src'; '__main__' is not a package
```"
2012,2019-05-07T11:06:49.324500,Ashley,"ok, so it looks like I was right"
2012,2019-05-07T11:07:22.325200,Ashley,"because you are calling `python app/src/application.py`, your context is limited to the `app/src/` directory"
2012,2019-05-07T11:08:26.325800,Ashley,"basically, python doesn't care about anything above that folder, because you didn't treat the whole thing like it was a package"
2012,2019-05-07T11:08:59.326200,Ashley,so now the solution
2012,2019-05-07T11:09:16.326500,Ashley,`python -m app.src.application some args`
2012,2019-05-07T11:09:45.326900,Ashley,that treats `app/src/application.py` as a module within a larger package
2012,2019-05-07T11:12:55.327100,Holly,I actually used zlib here to decompress the messages on the fly so I could then decode them without issue :slightly_smiling_face:
2012,2019-05-07T11:14:25.328100,Gemma,Nice so your hunch that they were compressed was correct!
2012,2019-05-07T11:14:43.328500,Leida,and now does work
2012,2019-05-07T11:15:06.329100,Leida,only question i have is is this the right way?
2012,2019-05-07T11:15:30.329500,Leida,how does one evoke the bot that writes about asking questions?
2012,2019-05-07T11:15:42.329600,Leana,"If you have a question, please just ask it. Please do not ask for topic experts;  do not DM or ping random users. We cannot begin to answer a question until we actually get a question.

2012,2019-05-07T11:20:20.330600,Hiroko,None
2012,2019-05-07T11:23:13.333800,Ashley,"<@Leida> it's the right way for some things. I would just make sure you have that `if __name__ == '__main__':` bit in there so you can explicitly provide behavior you want when that module is called directly. Other than that, I would make sure you have the `__main__.py` module in the root with the appropriate behavior (once the time comes for you app to actually be used like one) so you can call the ""app"" directly"
2012,2019-05-07T11:24:46.334800,Leida,"thanks, i do have `__name__ ==` bit already, trying to use it for manual testing"
2012,2019-05-07T11:28:19.335200,Ashley,"it's also a good idea to consider the behavior you're testing, and try to build unit tests that validate it"
2012,2019-05-07T11:28:39.335500,Ashley,that way you get the tests in at the same time that you implement the behavior
2012,2019-05-07T11:31:03.335900,Leida,i know its good i just have never gotten to doing it proper...
2012,2019-05-07T11:31:58.336600,Leida,currently im supposed to build a microservice around a prebuilt model of a face detection network
2012,2019-05-07T11:32:23.337100,Leida,i started off with trying to get to grips with tensorflow enough to even run the model properly
2012,2019-05-07T11:33:26.337800,Leida,so now that i have something working im refactoring it into a project with web oriented layout
2012,2019-05-07T11:33:47.338600,Leida,so i dont know exactly when or which bits i would test
2012,2019-05-07T11:35:10.340700,Leida,"like right now i test that the script works and i get a properly detected image out, this is human verifiable, but the api would just give the boxes coordinates"
2012,2019-05-07T11:35:53.341500,Leida,is there any good resource how to get the workflow right that is python oriented?
2012,2019-05-07T11:55:36.350800,Ashley,"<@Leida> just make sure you treat things that are basically a tool (in this case, something that can detect faces and return a bounding box) as a separate resource. That'll make compartmentalization simpler and help you avoid things getting tightly coupled. Your microservice itself should be able to treat the face detection tool as a black box that it just passes an image (or image location) to and gets back the bounding box. This makes your code less coupled, and makes writing tests much easier"
2012,2019-05-07T11:57:47.352500,Ashley,"I would recommend trying to create an importable package that you can keep totally separate of your microservice's code. That way, you can install that package in the environment your microservice will use, and then it can just do `from facenet import detect_face` and then just call `bounding_box = detect_face(image_location)`"
2012,2019-05-07T11:59:55.354200,Leida,umm so i would have the detection logic in a separate repo and pull it in as a submodule to the api repo?
2012,2019-05-07T12:00:09.354800,Ashley,I wouldn't say separate repo necessarily
2012,2019-05-07T12:00:19.355100,Ashley,you can definitely have it in the same repo
2012,2019-05-07T12:00:24.355300,Ashley,"sometimes having a separate package entirely is a bit much, so I like to have a `utils` subpackage in the root package where I keep the source for those types of tools."
2012,2019-05-07T12:00:40.355700,Ashley,then I can do `from app.utils import detect_face`
2012,2019-05-07T12:01:53.356700,Ashley,"it's still almost entirely separate form the app's code, and you can have your app still treat it like a black box"
2012,2019-05-07T12:02:13.357100,Ashley,"at that point, it's really just personal preference"
2012,2019-05-07T12:02:44.357700,Leida,well what i have is app.py to deal with the api that imports application.py that has the face detection business logic
2012,2019-05-07T12:03:14.358400,Leida,and i have utilities folder that keeps the visualizer code that takes the image and the boxes and draws em on
2012,2019-05-07T12:09:39.361600,Holly,"yeah the starting bytes of 0x8b and 1xf were the giveaway once I really looked, then it was just a matter of taking the decompressed decoded data, doing a `literal_eval` to turn it to a dict then parsing it all out into log files was a synch!"
2012,2019-05-07T12:10:37.363200,Ashley,"I would suggest asking if you could see something being reasonably used as a standalone tool. If so, it should be in that utils subpackage"
2012,2019-05-07T12:10:42.363400,Ashley,Or it's own package
2012,2019-05-07T12:13:15.364500,Leida,hmm so my visualizer could be a method in the face detection class and the class as an utility?
2012,2019-05-07T12:14:12.365000,Ashley,Remember to keep it compartmentalized and decoupled
2012,2019-05-07T12:14:49.366100,Ashley,Detecting a face isn't related to drawing a square on an image given some coordinates
2012,2019-05-07T12:16:31.367900,Ashley,"I don't know how you're visualizing it, but you don't need to detect a face to visualize some info. The info you get from the face detection process just happens to be the info you want to visualize"
2012,2019-05-07T12:18:47.368200,Jimmy,maybe <@Elaine> can help you with that. he often answer in <#CCC8SRJHX|documentation> about sphinx question (hopefully the ping doesn't annoys you <@Elaine> :slightly_smiling_face: )

2012,2019-05-07T12:22:12.369600,Holly,"I'm trying to use pathlib to check if a file exists, if it doesn't create it with the following try except block:

it runs no problem, it prints the path out no problem, there's no errors, but the file is never created"
2012,2019-05-07T12:23:33.370100,Holly,"not sure if there's just a simpler way of doing it, like trying to open the file maybe and if there's a NoFileFound exception create it?"
2012,2019-05-07T12:24:51.371000,Holly,"not at the moment, just creating an empty one"

This is something I've been meaning to look into, I don't like it either (output gets confusing to read when the type hints are more complicated). I will try and remember to look tonight, if you are using autodoc what I'm going to try is this `<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html#event-autodoc-process-signature>` when `what` is `""function""`

&gt; method signature is printed on a single line

This may or may not be possible, I'm not sure.

&gt; method signature should highlight syntax

Hmm. This may be possible if we can figure out how to get access to emitting changes to the function signature (the same place, wherever it is, that doing single line to custom indented takes place). You can use pygments (same thing that is used to show code in the docs with `.. code-block::`).

I'll take a look later tonight and see if I can figure out more info. These are things I would want to do too :slightly_smiling_face: feel free to ping me if I forget..."

Hi guys there is a simple way to format the methods signature in sphinx?
I am using RTD Theme, and building to html.

The problems I have at the moment are:
• custom types annotations created using typing module are being printed in their full form, but I would like just their name to be printed (ex. `CustomType = Union[type1, type2, type3]`should be rendered as simply `CustomType`, but gets rendered as `Union[type1, type2, type3]` instead)
• method signature is printed on a single line, I would like it to be printed as an indented custom form
• method signature should highlight syntax somehow like in an IDE"

2024,2019-05-07T18:05:58.414700,Walton,"with that i tried:
for i in range (1,4):

2024,2019-05-07T18:06:50.414900,Marth,"sorry...I haven't read the whole conversation here...but I think have you tried creating a list from your values.  So `data = ['one fish', 'two fish', 'red fish', 'blue fish']`"
2024,2019-05-07T18:06:59.415100,Marth,then in your for loop doing something like
2024,2019-05-07T18:07:23.415300,Marth,"`Sheet['(row=1, column=headers)'].value = data[header]`"
2024,2019-05-07T18:07:53.415500,Marth,also notice `==` is to check if something equals something you want to use one `=` to set a value
2024,2019-05-07T18:08:08.415700,Krista,^ Good catch with the `==`
2024,2019-05-07T18:09:14.415900,Marth,"shoot that should be  `= data[headers]`  with an ""s"" since that your for iterator"
2024,2019-05-07T18:09:20.416100,Krista,"And the `lista` appears to be a variable name in their example, replace it with `data[row_index][column_index]` for your process"
2024,2019-05-07T18:10:58.416300,Walton,"hey Dan. all great advice. here is my output with your suggestion though :disappointed: ValueError: (row=1, column=headers) is not a valid coordinate or range"

2024,2019-05-07T18:26:12.421200,Walton,4 different attempts
2024,2019-05-07T18:31:44.424700,Walton,"yeah I JUST made the change in value for data, and I now get no error, but only thing listed is in A1, and it's Blue Fish"
2024,2019-05-07T18:41:25.433800,Walton,<@Marth> <@Krista> Thanks so much for your input. you guys showed me a few variations to ways of thinking
2025,2019-05-07T18:30:16.422400,Maricruz,"Sorry didn't read the rest of the above chain but
```
#attempt 1
for headers in range (1,4):
    cellref.value = data[headers]
```
should be:
```
for headers in range(0,4):
    cellref.value = data[headers][0]
```"
2025,2019-05-07T18:30:46.423200,Walton,i thought openpyxl doesn't use 0
2025,2019-05-07T18:30:57.423400,Maricruz,"Although I think you can just write `data` as a regular list rather than a list of lists? `data = ['One Fish', 'Two Fish', etc]`"
2025,2019-05-07T18:32:04.425000,Walton,None
2025,2019-05-07T18:32:23.425700,Maricruz,You need to loop through the row you want your headers in
2025,2019-05-07T18:32:32.426000,Maricruz,right now you're just assigning the value to `cellref` over and over again
2025,2019-05-07T18:32:40.426300,Walton,"ah crap, your right"
2025,2019-05-07T18:34:58.426500,Walton,OH!

2025,2019-05-07T18:36:57.428700,Maricruz,So indexes on lists start at 0
2025,2019-05-07T18:36:59.428900,Maricruz,rather than 1
2025,2019-05-07T18:37:03.429200,Maricruz,so you're missing the first entry in your list
2025,2019-05-07T18:37:04.429300,Walton,tried that
2025,2019-05-07T18:37:19.429700,Walton,None

2025,2019-05-07T18:37:59.430600,Maricruz,Something like that
2025,2019-05-07T18:38:10.430800,Walton,i'll try the +1
2025,2019-05-07T18:39:14.431800,Priscilla,"this may sound really dumb, is there a way to make this printout start at 1 and not 0?

2025,2019-05-07T18:40:22.433000,Maricruz,grats :slightly_smiling_face:
2025,2019-05-07T18:42:13.434800,Walton,"<@Maricruz> thank you. I knew it was SOMETHING. those little nuances of 0,4 index when it doesn't use 0, but yet adding the +1... this isn't covered in books"
2025,2019-05-07T18:42:56.434900,Walton,None
2025,2019-05-07T19:03:35.436000,Maricruz,Definitely - being able to read errors is pretty important - it'll come with experience!
2025,2019-05-07T19:53:57.437200,Maricruz,<@Priscilla> not dumb cuz I can't figure it out (although I'm pretty python dumb so take that as you will haha)
2025,2019-05-07T19:54:04.437500,Maricruz,Can you post what `Fore.BLUE` is?
2025,2019-05-07T19:57:04.438500,Priscilla,"its for the package colorama, it displays command line text colored. in this case colored blue"
2025,2019-05-07T19:57:20.438900,Priscilla,yeah I cant find anything on it either
2025,2019-05-07T19:57:42.439400,Sasha,`enumerate()` can take a `start=1` parameter if you don't want it to begin from 0.
2025,2019-05-07T20:00:06.440900,Priscilla,hmmm.... i was asking the wrong question i do believe
2025,2019-05-07T20:00:09.441100,Priscilla,thank you sir
2025,2019-05-07T20:00:18.441300,Sasha,"BTW, from a stylistic perspective, I'd recommend avoiding the `*k` pattern you have there. It's correct, but it will throw people off versus explicit `i, ser` variables."
2025,2019-05-07T20:00:59.441800,Sasha,"If you wanted to skip the first element instead, you can use `serials[1:]`."
2025,2019-05-07T20:02:10.442800,Priscilla,i  wanted `start=1` but i was looking at `serials[1:]` for my solution
2025,2019-05-07T20:02:21.443100,Priscilla,by mistake
2025,2019-05-07T20:02:34.443400,Priscilla,good point on the *k
2026,2019-05-07T20:27:21.447900,Glenna,"Question for the group, why are most Python jobs coupled with Java language jobs? 

From my perspective - It appears that most of the successful websites can almost eliminate Java except for this huge unreadable obfuscated section of Java. 

Is Java even used anywhere else other than obfuscation?"
2026,2019-05-07T20:27:52.448400,Bethany,I haven't observed what you're describing
2026,2019-05-07T20:27:57.448600,Hiroko,me either
2026,2019-05-07T20:28:29.450400,Glenna,Right click on <http://google.com|google.com> and this huge blob of unreadable java
2026,2019-05-07T20:28:31.450600,Hiroko,unless its in a “nice to have” section?
2026,2019-05-07T20:28:52.451500,Glenna,Is that some kind of convention?
2026,2019-05-07T20:29:26.452200,Hiroko,its fairly common from my last job hunt
2026,2019-05-07T20:29:39.452800,Glenna,For web front end?
2026,2019-05-07T20:29:43.453000,Hiroko,"you get the postion requirements, and then a “nice to have” or extras section"
2026,2019-05-07T20:29:58.453400,Hiroko,"I think you might want to rephrase your question, since I’m not sure what you’re asking about"
2026,2019-05-07T20:31:32.456400,Glenna,"I am trying to understand why Java is required if the job title is ""python developer"""
2026,2019-05-07T20:32:49.458700,Glenna,"Strictly for web front end? Obfuscation? Or Java is just being replaced, so the job posting wants you to have java to convert it to python?"
2026,2019-05-07T20:33:24.459200,Maricruz,sure you're not mixing up Java and Javascript?
2026,2019-05-07T20:33:49.460000,Maricruz,I haven't seen that as far as web dev goes
2026,2019-05-07T20:34:42.461100,Hiroko,"there’s no pythin in web FE, unless you’re using kivy or brython"
2026,2019-05-07T20:35:13.462300,Glenna,Exactly. Trying to answer my own question
2026,2019-05-07T20:35:51.462900,Hiroko,"if you’re going web frontend, the default language is javascript"
2026,2019-05-07T20:36:12.463400,Hiroko,"you can use some transpilers from language X to JS, but those have their faults"
2026,2019-05-07T20:37:11.465000,Glenna,What if a stearing committee was formed to influence netscape-mozilla-firefox/chrome outcome?
2026,2019-05-07T20:38:33.467200,Glenna,I have heard it is difficult to poll for responses on static websites. So many new web 3.0 (like Kodi) dump the browser technology
2026,2019-05-07T20:39:37.468500,Glenna,Would it not seem valid if javascript obfuscation is the cutting edge of malware?
2026,2019-05-07T20:40:47.469800,Glenna,Would you use kodi for banking if the python bytecode could be certified in some way?
2026,2019-05-07T20:42:44.470400,Hiroko,I… have no clue what you’re talking about?
2026,2019-05-07T20:43:09.471000,Hiroko,"if you’re looking at JS on the page, you’re probably mixing up minified with obfusicated"
2026,2019-05-07T20:44:36.472500,Glenna,???
2026,2019-05-07T20:50:23.475100,Hiroko,<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)>
2026,2019-05-07T20:50:36.475800,Hiroko,that’s not the same as obfusicated
2026,2019-05-07T20:51:06.476600,Glenna,Is that what you see when you right click and view code on google?
2026,2019-05-07T20:52:53.479200,Glenna,"So how could you convince an employer to make that code python bytecode, instead of javascript?"
2026,2019-05-07T20:54:38.481800,Glenna,It is so dirty looking...
2026,2019-05-07T20:58:42.482400,Hiroko,you’re gonna have a tough time with that
2026,2019-05-07T20:59:22.483100,Hiroko,I worked at a place using google web toolkit to write async apps in java
2026,2019-05-07T20:59:48.483700,Hiroko,"worked ok, as long as you stayed within the limits.  but don’t forget about leaky abstractions"
2026,2019-05-07T21:14:19.484200,Glenna,Thanks!
2026,2019-05-07T21:16:00.486200,Glenna,On all the other websites so long as you disable the minify or obfuscated java - it can reduce malware
2026,2019-05-07T22:01:10.492400,Glenna,Never mind. Thanks for your help
2027,2019-05-07T20:51:53.477100,Hiroko,yes
2028,2019-05-07T21:48:06.486900,Hsiu,"Perhaps I’m being pedantic, but Java != JavaScript."
2028,2019-05-07T21:59:35.490600,Glenna,"Yeah yeah java needs an interpreter, javascript needs an interpreter, neither run the ASIC"
2028,2019-05-07T22:00:44.491700,Hiroko,Huh?
2028,2019-05-07T23:30:34.495000,Sasha,BTW it's good practice to put a `time.sleep()` call in such loops to avoid burning 100% CPU. Even sleeping for a millisecond often makes a big difference.
2029,2019-05-07T23:08:30.492500,Priscilla,am i correct that this should loop for 2 hours? because it didn't and i am trying to figure out why
2029,2019-05-07T23:12:36.493300,Priscilla,oh jesus christ it goes by seconds not minutes.... lol nvm
2030,2019-05-08T02:48:04.497800,Rayford,"Hi, I came across an issue with django rest framework. I'm getting a throtteling issue because I'm doing a lot of requests. One solution is to change the rate throttle to something big in my local settings but I feel it's not right. Any other solutions?"
2030,2019-05-08T03:14:24.498300,Rayford,Or maybe how to reset django rest framework rate cache?
2030,2019-05-08T03:20:03.498700,Rayford,"Never mind, I managed to fix it by clearing the cache."
2030,2019-05-08T03:22:21.000600,Kori,Looking for a quick opinion.  I have some APIs I am deploying via Lambda/API Gateway with _very_ slow moving data (it’s public data that is updated annually).  Because it’s small and so slow moving I’ve pickled the dataframes and bundled them in with the API.  Does anyone think I might get faster performance if I put the dataframes into a SQLite database instead?   I’ve not been able to find much info on the relative speed of unpickling Vs SQLlite.  I’m going to look at creating a prototype in Dev but any thoughts welcome.
2030,2019-05-08T03:37:01.001000,Kori,"HDF, Parquet and Feather I have tried.  Feather was faster than pickle, but having PyArrow in my deployment package was taking me over the Lambda limit as that package alone is about 120MB.  I don’t recall there being much improvement with HDF"
2030,2019-05-08T04:11:38.001600,Kori,"Interesting, thanks for this.  Gives me some idea what to possibly expect."
2030,2019-05-08T06:35:52.002500,Jonas,Measure it. Pickle (or cPickle on py2 :disappointed:) will be faster i would expect
2031,2019-05-08T03:34:54.000800,Guillermina,"May I suggest: just give it a try and measure? There is `DataFrame.to_sql`...

There are also: `DataFrame.to_pickle`,  `DataFrame.to_hdf` and `DataFrame.to_parquet` et al.
Might be worth experimenting with the different options..."
2031,2019-05-08T04:06:11.001200,Guillermina,"Have a look at that: <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html#io-perf>
Looks like sql is rather slow..."
2031,2019-05-08T04:08:32.001400,Guillermina,"&gt; When reading, the top three are test_feather_read, test_pickle_read and test_hdf_fixed_read."
2032,2019-05-08T10:31:19.004100,Maricela,What would be the easiest way for me to install pip packages on a server that doesn't have access to the internet?
2032,2019-05-08T10:35:29.004500,Jonas,bundle your app as a docker image.
2032,2019-05-08T10:37:00.005300,Eliana,docker would be difficult to use w/o internet too.
2032,2019-05-08T10:37:10.005500,Maricela,I just need pip packages
2032,2019-05-08T10:37:38.005900,Maricela,the app is already on the server
2032,2019-05-08T10:38:07.006600,Jonas,Docker wouldn't be difficult to use at all
2032,2019-05-08T10:38:10.006800,Maricela,"I was thinking using my local machine to download the packages and just installing them on the server, but I'm not sure how that would work."

2032,2019-05-08T10:40:29.009400,Clemmie,What does audible mean in this context? never seen it used like that before

2032,2019-05-08T10:41:23.009800,Jonas,"if you want to deploy something to an air-gapped system with no network, you generally do it as a single 'thing': a VM image typically."
2032,2019-05-08T10:41:57.010000,Jonas,"But you can do the same with docker, at the lowest level `docker export` produces a `tar.gz` file of your image that you or the client can move to a secure server"
2032,2019-05-08T10:42:08.010200,Clemmie,"sorry, yeah - I meant “audible” usually that means “with sound”"

2033,2019-05-08T14:04:41.014900,Dante,maybe
2033,2019-05-08T14:08:00.015700,Dante,would prefer to not use submodules if possible because they make it more complicated for other people to stay up to date (having to run `git submodule update`)

2033,2019-05-08T14:09:06.016900,Dante,the cleanest but lamest solution seems like to toggle commenting out the github version and uncommenting the path link when i want to hack on both projects

2037,2019-05-08T21:21:31.026200,Anna,or some sort of proxy which stores my credentials and also tranfers data as is.

2039,2019-05-09T00:10:50.029000,Lanelle,"a = [0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1]
how do i move all 1's to the end of the list"
2039,2019-05-09T00:13:42.029300,Lanelle,"this is my try:
```a = [0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1]

b=[]
count = 0
for i in a:
    if i!=1:
        b.insert(len(a),i)  ```"
2039,2019-05-09T00:18:54.030400,Sasha,"So, the `len(a)` there is problematic, since `b` starts from length 0 and grows, instead of being as long as `a`."
2039,2019-05-09T00:19:09.030900,Sasha,You'll also want to have an `else` case for what to do with the `1` values.
2040,2019-05-09T00:39:20.031800,Mildred,"what if you cycled through a and popped any 1 you found into another list, and then just append the new list to the remains of a?"
2040,2019-05-09T00:41:51.032300,Sasha,It's generally a little tricky to modify a list while you're iterating through it.
2040,2019-05-09T00:45:52.034400,Mildred,"not my strongest suit, but i would have thought something like below would work:

for i in range(0,len(a)-1):
    if a[i] == 1:
        b.append(a.pop[i])
a=a+b"
2040,2019-05-09T00:48:14.035500,Sasha,"Yeah, the trouble is that as soon as the `pop()` executes, that shifts a new value down into the `i`th slot, but the `for` loop will move on to `i+1` without ever doing anything with that value."
2040,2019-05-09T00:49:24.035800,Mildred,"ahh, i get what you are saying."
2040,2019-05-09T00:50:54.036900,Mildred,so if you could interate through in reverse it would work
2040,2019-05-09T00:51:47.037700,Sasha,"You can do it, but it requires a little more control over the loop, like:
```while i &lt; len(a):
  if a[i] == 1:
    b.append(a.pop[i])
  else:
    i += 1```
And yeah, going in reverse is also a common solution."
2040,2019-05-09T00:56:05.038000,Mildred,<@Lanelle> does this help?
2040,2019-05-09T00:59:37.038800,Sasha,There's also the one-liner approach: `[x for x in a if x != 1] + [x for x in a if x == 1]`.
2040,2019-05-09T01:00:08.039000,Mildred,now you're just shownig off :stuck_out_tongue:
2041,2019-05-09T01:20:55.039700,Raguel,"not a one-liner, but something like this:
```
a = [0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1]
cnt = a.count(1)
for i in range(cnt):
    a.remove(1)
a = a + [1]*cnt
```"
2042,2019-05-09T02:13:37.041100,Chester,I like the one-liner approach (you can unfold it to multiple lines) because it builds a new list instead of mutating an existing one
2042,2019-05-09T02:14:34.041900,Chester,This actually makes it easier to pass any iterable instead of strictly list
2042,2019-05-09T02:16:41.043000,Sasha,"Yep. It does iterate twice, but approaches with `pop`, `remove`, or `insert` can end up O(n^2)."
2042,2019-05-09T02:19:33.046000,Leida,it unfolds nicely and is pretty readable with decent names
2042,2019-05-09T02:25:43.046700,Guillermina,"you could just sort it...
``` # python 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.sort(cmp=lambda a,b: 0 if 1 not in (a,b) else (1 if a == 1 else -1))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(a)
[0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1]
```

Even better:
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.sort(key=lambda x: x == 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(a)
[0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1]
```"
2042,2019-05-09T02:31:22.047700,Leida,"or
```
from itertools import filterfalse, tee

def partition(pred, iterable):
    'Use a predicate to partition entries into false entries and true entries'
    # partition(is_odd, range(10)) --&gt; 0 2 4 6 8   and  1 3 5 7 9
    t1, t2 = tee(iterable)
    return filterfalse(pred, t1), filter(pred, t2)
```"
2042,2019-05-09T02:32:56.048800,Chester,"Slightly shorter version, also immutable:
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(a, key=lambda item: item == 1)
[0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1]
```"
2042,2019-05-09T02:33:47.049500,Sasha,Stable sorts are so nice...
2042,2019-05-09T02:38:08.049600,Guillermina,"yeah, sry - above is still python 2... `cmp` doesn't even exist anymore in py3...

Was just about to correct it, but I'll leave that for reference now :wink:"
2042,2019-05-09T02:39:25.050000,Chester,"It actually does, through <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.cmp_to_key>"
2042,2019-05-09T02:42:12.050200,Guillermina,Right. I meant (and probably should have written): `cmp` does not exist anymore as a keyword for `sort`/`sorted` in py3...  :smile:
2042,2019-05-09T02:48:31.051300,Guillermina,With larger lists the two list comprehensions will be faster than `sort/sorted` though...

2054,2019-05-10T01:05:03.102000,Sasha,The easiest change would be to use `itertools.zip_longest()` instead of `zip()`. You can tell it to fill in the missing values with an empty string.
2054,2019-05-10T01:05:15.102200,Lanelle,could you give me a snippet
2054,2019-05-10T01:06:48.102400,Sasha,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest>

''.join(''.join(x) for x in itertools.zip_longest(a, b, fillvalue=''))"
2054,2019-05-10T01:12:37.103900,Sasha,"Yep. I was assuming that <@Lanelle> could use his original `append` logic, but that double `join` should also work."

2054,2019-05-10T01:20:03.105500,Sasha,"Ah, it's called `izip_longest()` in Py2."

2054,2019-05-10T01:56:59.110600,Shan,that led me down a path to find the most optimal fizzbuzz

2055,2019-05-10T01:28:18.106000,Jamey,"Hi. I have a problem. In the model `FieldType`, I am trying to create a model that gives the user access to any of Django's field types (text, number, string) so that they can create their own field. What would I put at line #6 so that I can do that?"
2056,2019-05-10T02:10:05.112200,Leida,i really love the itertools infinite sequences solution to fizzbuzz... if you dont know what a while loop is then that should be one of the most intuitive ways to code it
2056,2019-05-10T02:12:25.112500,Leida,"something like this ```import itertools

def fizzbuzz():
  fizz = itertools.cycle([""""] * 2 + [""fizz""])
  buzz = itertools.cycle([""""] * 4 + [""buzz""])

  for i in range(1, 101):
    print next(fizz) + next(buzz) or i```"
2056,2019-05-10T02:13:15.112900,Leida,only replace the for loop with real number generator
2056,2019-05-10T02:15:08.114000,Sasha,"That's clever, but it's also fragile, since there's no inherent connection to `i` in the iterator logic. Change the loop to start from 2 instead of 1 and it all falls apart."
2056,2019-05-10T02:16:08.114800,Leida,"this is a version of what i meant i found on google with a quick search, the real one has 3 infinite sequences and merges em into a generator"

2056,2019-05-10T02:19:21.117500,Leida,makes you look at the `*` and `+` instead of the core idea

2056,2019-05-10T04:01:41.144500,Eveline,"ok, then different problem. Create a dict of k, v of field_info that are not in excluded_fields"
2056,2019-05-10T04:01:49.144800,Eveline,excluded_fields is a list of keys
2056,2019-05-10T04:01:56.145100,Eveline,at this point is better a dict comp
2056,2019-05-10T04:02:02.145300,Guillermina,use the dict comprehension from above`...
2056,2019-05-10T04:02:38.146100,Guillermina,just remove the `.keys()` - and it woll work for both lists/dicts as excluded_whatever

2060,2019-05-10T05:33:56.167200,Tam,"Hello everyone. I have a bit of an implementation problem and I'd like your professional suggestion. I'm using FlaskSQLAlchemy for the management of the database object.

In my project, which you can think of as a SaaS, when you create a Company(sort of), this company has to subscribe by making payment to _my_ company. This subscription could be for a month, a quarter/half of a year, or it cover a whole year. When the company's subscription is active, all routes in _my_ company's API would be accessible but immediately the subscription expires, none of the routes become accessible. It sends you a *subscription ended* RESTful result.

Now, there's a model `Company` that has several columns, one of each is `subscriptions` which is *supposed* to hold all the subscriptions that a company has made including the expired subscriptions and the current active one. 

```
class Company (db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'companies'
    subscriptions = db.relationship('Subscription', backref='company', lazy='dynamic')
   # followed by several other columns

class Subscription (db.Model):
# stuffs

```

Now my question is, how do you think I can implement the subscription 'model' such that when I add a `@active_subscription_on` decorator on a route, this decorator checks the current user's company's subscription to see if their subscription is active?

How can I implement the subscription system?"
2060,2019-05-10T05:44:07.175200,Tam,"Here's what I've thought of(although I haven't implemented it): when your company _clicks_ on buy subscription(to generate a key, think Windows OS serial key), for a month, I use `itsdangerous`'s `TimedJSONWebSignatureSerializer` to encode the duration of the subscription, then use `base64` on the result for something readable. That gives me the key to give to the company and when entered to extend their subscription days, I simply reverse the process to get the duration the subscription will cover. I can then add this period to the company's list of subscriptions. 

Now, I don't really know how to make the decorator gain access to this information and be quick with it!"
2060,2019-05-10T05:57:13.176200,Tam,"I did something similar in one of the decoratos:

2061,2019-05-10T05:44:13.175300,Bee,"Hi there, I have a similar setup where I check if a user’s role is permitted for a particular route. I have a custom `login_required()` function which is used as a decorator for each of my routes.

The function is:
```
def login_required(role=""ANY""):
    def wrapper(fn):
        @wraps(fn)
        def decorated_view(*args, **kwargs):
            if not current_user.is_authenticated:
                return current_app.login_manager.unauthorized()

            if role not in [current_user.role, ""ANY""]:
                return current_app.login_manager.unauthorized()   
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated_view
    return wrapper
```

and it is used as a decorator like this:
```
@app.route('/admin')
@login_required('super_admin')
def admin_page():
    return
```

I would suggest to make a similar decorator function that checks the subscription of the ‘current’ company - hope that helps"

2063,2019-05-10T09:43:07.190700,Claudine,do you want to get that path from within the python file?
2063,2019-05-10T09:43:17.190900,Claudine,i think you want the `sys` module
2063,2019-05-10T09:43:28.191200,Claudine,`sys.path` or something
2063,2019-05-10T09:43:34.191400,Leida,you can try `os.path.realpath(__file__)`
2063,2019-05-10T09:43:43.191900,Leida,<https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/os.path.html> path related docs
2063,2019-05-10T09:43:46.192100,Claudine,ahh yea `os.path` might be it
2063,2019-05-10T09:44:02.192400,Rodrick,i want to set the directory to a varable x
2063,2019-05-10T09:44:19.192900,Rodrick,my varable isnt x but just for explanation
2063,2019-05-10T09:44:39.193300,Claudine,yea `os.path.realpath(__file__)` will return a string representing the path
2063,2019-05-10T09:44:48.193600,Claudine,"you can just assign it like
`path = os.path.realpath(__file__)`"
2063,2019-05-10T09:49:16.194400,Rodrick,ok great thanks

2063,2019-05-10T09:57:53.196200,Rodrick,is that possible

2065,2019-05-10T10:47:10.199300,Darlene,I've let the install without `-v` sit for like 5 mins
2065,2019-05-10T10:47:18.199500,Darlene,currently ~2
2065,2019-05-10T10:54:21.199900,Darlene,"going on 10 mins, stuck at the same spot"

2066,2019-05-10T11:41:07.208000,Hiroko,"you mean something like

```blob_output = [blob.name for blob in blobs]
print(blob_output)```"
2066,2019-05-10T11:42:31.209400,Avis,yea but converting the object/class to a list
2066,2019-05-10T11:43:06.210100,Clemmie,how would you expect the object to be represented as a list?
2066,2019-05-10T11:43:27.210500,Avis,or should i learn to work with objects directly instead of finding the easy way out
2066,2019-05-10T11:43:32.210700,Clemmie,^
2066,2019-05-10T11:43:45.211000,Clemmie,asking to represent an object as a list is nonsensical
2066,2019-05-10T11:44:43.211800,Avis,so I might have some concepts mixed up
2066,2019-05-10T11:45:45.212900,Clemmie,probably - an object (lets say class) is made up of function and attributes `x=2` etc. How would you expect that to show up as a list?
2066,2019-05-10T11:49:51.213400,Chester,Easy - you just need two lists!
2067,2019-05-10T12:10:36.215400,Raguel,"I am trying to understand that how backend of APIs are designed if I am using python. For example, /users will be mapped to one handler querying all users, but how is /users/123 is designed/parsed, or this one /users/123/projects?
```
All resources in REST are entities. They can be independent like:
GET /users - get all users
GET /users/123 - get a particular user with id = 123
GET /posts - get all posts
There are also dependent entities, that rely on their parent models:
GET /users/123/projects - get all the projects that a user with id = 123 has
```"
2067,2019-05-10T12:12:07.215700,Hiroko,that would be the responsibility of your handler
2067,2019-05-10T12:12:15.216000,Hiroko,"which would be a controller, or view"
2067,2019-05-10T12:17:28.217600,Raguel,"so for all these three different endpoints, there will be a different handler with different queries?"
2067,2019-05-10T12:18:18.218600,Rodrick,"I have a list of files and they all have different types of file extentions, its either `.exe` or `.txt` i have 2 lists how do i make it so that it can detect that it has a file name of a `txt` then it would add it to the TXT list and same for the `exe`"
2067,2019-05-10T12:18:25.218700,Raguel,"or like if they are related resources, one handler with if statements, parsing endpoints?"
2067,2019-05-10T12:19:40.219000,Raguel,`os.path.splitext` might be helpful
2067,2019-05-10T12:19:58.219200,Hiroko,"more like, one thing parsing the URL and packaging it into params for your handler"
2067,2019-05-10T12:20:11.219400,Hiroko,a mapper would map your URL definition to a handler
2067,2019-05-10T12:20:38.219600,Rodrick,How would I use that in that scenario
2067,2019-05-10T12:21:07.219800,Hiroko,"so one handler per endpoint that would handle the HTTP verb required (get, put, post, delete, etc)"
2067,2019-05-10T12:22:13.220000,Raguel,do you have sample file names?
2067,2019-05-10T12:23:01.220200,Rodrick,"Yes, dataentry.exe, dataentry2.exe, and dataentry.txt, dataentry2.txt"
2067,2019-05-10T12:23:09.220400,Rodrick,But the names will greatly change
2067,2019-05-10T12:23:19.220600,Rodrick,those are just samples
2067,2019-05-10T12:24:02.220800,Raguel,"and when we say endpoint here, /users would be one, and users/123 would be another, and two handlers for each, right?"
2067,2019-05-10T12:24:28.221000,Raguel,"or I should be making like one handler for /users, and then parse that if there is 123 after that, I should fetch from same handler"
2067,2019-05-10T12:25:25.221200,Raguel,"you have those names already in list, or you are going to read them from directory?"
2067,2019-05-10T12:26:07.221800,Hiroko,correct.  because one would be a List in the response and the other woould be a Detail
2067,2019-05-10T12:26:23.222000,Hiroko,"you can share logic between them, but they have different responsibilities"
2067,2019-05-10T12:27:21.222200,Rodrick,I have them in a list and i have 2 other lists to add the files to but i want it to be able add it to either the EXE filetype list if it is an exe and add it to the TXT filetype list if it is a txt
2067,2019-05-10T12:28:21.222600,Raguel,"okay that makes sense. also, I am not sure I understand controller/view -- let me read on them and get back to you if I have more questions. thanks a lot!!"

2072,2019-05-10T16:17:18.257000,Tyson,"I'm looking for an elegant way to use some LRUCache, e.g. from cachetools, with multi-keys."
2072,2019-05-10T16:18:03.258000,Tyson,Any ideas where to start?
2072,2019-05-10T16:19:00.258800,Clemmie,I think you would want a wrapper that mapped the multi-keys to a single shared key before hitting the LRUChache decorated object
2072,2019-05-10T16:20:54.259300,Tyson,hmm... that would be possible if I'd knew all possible keys in advance
2072,2019-05-10T16:21:01.259500,Tyson,e.g. just hash them all together
2072,2019-05-10T16:22:55.262000,Tyson,"the flow is like that: a user requests a object by key. if the object exists in the cache, it's returned"
2072,2019-05-10T16:23:14.262600,Tyson,"another user reuqests the object but using a different key (e.g. a different, unique property)"
2072,2019-05-10T16:23:22.262800,Tyson,the object is already in cache
2072,2019-05-10T16:23:27.263100,Clemmie,"the trouble is that LRUCache maps the function call to the return value, so if you have a different function call (different key in param) it will be different - even keyword order on calling can be a different entry `f(a=1, b=2)` might not hit the cache of `f(b=2, a=1)`"
2072,2019-05-10T16:23:38.263400,Holly,What if you load the file into the script make the changes and just rewrite that way the order and formatting are retained?
2072,2019-05-10T16:23:57.264100,Tyson,"so, after I found the matching object I'd like to add the second key so it can be found if the next user requests the object using one of the two keys we know so far"
2072,2019-05-10T16:24:41.264700,Clemmie,"is there a computation taking place, or just a lookup?"
2072,2019-05-10T16:24:51.265100,Tyson,lookup
2072,2019-05-10T16:24:59.265500,Tyson,and some read io
2072,2019-05-10T16:25:00.265600,Clemmie,LRUCache is really for computation heavy functions. It won’t give you anything for lookups
2072,2019-05-10T16:25:33.266300,Tyson,I just wanted to dump all stuff into memory so I don't have to read from disk for every request
2072,2019-05-10T16:25:50.266600,Tyson,thought a simply dict would do it
2072,2019-05-10T16:25:55.266900,Tyson,I want to limit it's size
2072,2019-05-10T16:26:02.267300,Tyson,LRU seems like a nice strategy
2072,2019-05-10T16:26:29.268200,Tyson,also: concurrent access could be an issue
2072,2019-05-10T16:26:29.268300,Clemmie,"sure, you can build a cache to do it, and mimic the functionality of LRUCache, but you will need to build you own tooling"
2072,2019-05-10T16:27:13.269100,Tyson,"I see. okay, good to know. So at least I know LRUCache will most probably be a dead end"

2073,2019-05-10T16:48:54.272300,Raguel,basically it starts from last element
2073,2019-05-10T16:49:10.272800,Rodrick,ahhhh
2073,2019-05-10T16:49:29.273300,Raguel,you should try this with your lists to get better understanding how slicing works

2074,2019-05-10T21:49:09.274600,Priscilla,"within `BurnIn()` is a function called `report()`. `report()`has a variable `output_csv` when searching for how to reference this variable, it  tells me to implement it like line 5 `device.output_csv` but doing that my editor yells at me and doesnt run. What am i doing wrong?"
2074,2019-05-10T22:18:33.276700,Sasha,"Your `report()` function would want to store the output in `self.output_csv`. If it's just a function-local variable, it disappears when the function exits."
2074,2019-05-10T22:19:56.277700,Priscilla,"yeah it is a local variable and i do need it to disappear, looks like i need a workaround."
2074,2019-05-10T22:20:15.278200,Sasha,Can you clarify why you need it to disappear?
2074,2019-05-10T22:20:27.278600,Sasha,"Looks like you need it to remain around for a while, to write it."
2074,2019-05-10T22:23:13.280300,Priscilla,"so i updated it with the timed loop I need the for loop to run within. there is another loop inside of the function `report()` I need to write it after the time loops finish, so I took the write statment out of the `report()` function."
2074,2019-05-10T22:23:59.280700,Priscilla,here is the function
2074,2019-05-10T22:25:47.282000,Sasha,"Do you need the output to be a combination of all of the output from the different serials, and write it when all of them are done?"
2074,2019-05-10T22:26:22.282200,Priscilla,yes
2074,2019-05-10T22:29:20.285100,Sasha,"Okay, in that case you need to have `output_csv` be a variable in your top-level code, and have each device return their part to be appended. For instance, in `report()` you would have `return output_str, output_csv`, and in the outer loop you'd have something like:
```output_csv = ''
for s in serials:
  device = BurnIn(s, usr)
  output, csv = device.report()
  print(output)
  output_csv += csv
with open('csvfile.csv', 'a') as f:
  f.write(output_csv)```"
2074,2019-05-10T22:32:24.287400,Sasha,"However, I might reconsider the requirement to write the output at the very end. With append mode, you can write as you go, and it might suck to lose all your data if the program crashes before it finishes."
2074,2019-05-10T22:34:35.288400,Priscilla,"ok, now that was one of my first plans. the problem is that `report()` does not return `output` it returns a similar string with spaces in it to display a kind of ""table"" so its not really comma seperated."
2074,2019-05-10T22:35:04.288900,Priscilla,"and i will take your advice on appending, instead of writting."
2074,2019-05-10T22:37:18.289700,Priscilla,"because it prints out the statuse every minute, but only appends to the csv after the full 24 hours have finished"
2074,2019-05-10T22:38:47.290400,Sasha,"That's why I said you should `return output_str, output_csv` in `report()`, to get access to both the printable text and the CSV data."
2074,2019-05-10T22:46:31.291900,Priscilla,"how neat, how does it know to assign to `output` and `csv` respectively?"
2074,2019-05-10T22:47:11.292600,Priscilla,"oh,
`output, csv = ...`
and
`return output, csv`
i guess"
2074,2019-05-10T22:48:06.293300,Sasha,"Yep. It's actually returning a 2-element tuple, and unpacking it when you assign the return value to 2 variables."
2074,2019-05-10T22:51:46.293900,Priscilla,very cool
2074,2019-05-10T22:53:44.294700,Hsiu,"That’s why a stray comma can make your code behave in unexpected ways. `x = 1,` means `x = (1, )` (a tuple, not an int)"
2074,2019-05-10T23:18:56.295000,Priscilla,that makes a lot of sense
2074,2019-05-10T23:30:35.295800,Priscilla,"for some reason this
```
def keypad_sim(self):
      ser_menu = 'PASS'
      self.keypad_sim_list.append(ser_menu)
```
gives me a `memory error` i guess its from ram getting full. I have never had to handle anything like that, are lists not supposed to get very long?"
2074,2019-05-11T00:10:05.298000,Sasha,"<@Priscilla> They can get quite long, but you can certainly fill up memory if you have an extremely long loop. Maybe print out `len(self.keypad_sim_list)` to see how much it's growing?"
2075,2019-05-10T23:57:32.296800,Alishia,"hi, can anyone tell me what does ""data normalization"" mean in machine learning?"
2075,2019-05-11T00:12:40.299400,Sasha,"<@Alishia> Usually that would mean re-scaling numbers to a common range, so that you don't have one feature which is 9,000,000,000 and another one which is 0.0000002 trying to be mixed together."
2075,2019-05-11T00:13:19.299900,Sasha,The guys in <#C0JB9ATQV|data_science> may be able to give you some more details.

2078,2019-05-11T13:18:14.310700,Hiroko,And it only works if the return from the previous includes the following method

2078,2019-05-11T13:26:55.311500,Lory,"so just to be clear, in my example, `lower()` is never called until the string is fully constructed"
2079,2019-05-11T13:39:20.311700,Hiroko,Correct 
2079,2019-05-11T13:46:22.312200,Bethany,we got a walrus operator but no pipe operator :cry:

2079,2019-05-11T14:01:56.313300,Bethany,how do I actually verify a `checksum` when I download a binary?
2079,2019-05-11T14:05:35.314000,Sasha,"Usually that'll be an MD5 hash, so you can use the `md5` or `md5sum` command-line tool, depending on your OS."
2079,2019-05-11T14:08:58.314600,Bethany,so what does it look like? `md5sum checksum -c binary_file`?
2079,2019-05-11T14:10:09.315000,Sasha,Normally just `md5sum binary_file`.
2079,2019-05-11T14:10:45.315300,Bethany,oh and just verify that you get the checksum out?
2079,2019-05-11T14:11:04.315500,Sasha,Yeah
2079,2019-05-11T14:12:16.316100,Sasha,"If you need to script it, it can also read in a checksum file with the hashes and filenames and check everything at once."

2079,2019-05-11T17:10:32.324000,Bethany,what does `transform_in_some_way` do?
2079,2019-05-11T17:28:13.327700,Bethany,I don't think either way is really preferred
2079,2019-05-11T17:28:45.328300,Bethany,"but `s = None` is different than `s = str()` or `s = """"`"
2079,2019-05-11T17:29:07.328800,Bethany,hm maybe `str()` for visual clarity
2079,2019-05-11T17:29:21.329200,Bethany,yup
2080,2019-05-11T14:52:52.316800,Pura,"Hi, is it possible to share and synchronise and list of classes between processes using multiprocessing library?"
2081,2019-05-11T15:46:34.319900,Doug,"it sounds like you’re trying to deal with global or shared shared state while multiprocessing, which is tricky. maybe this will help: <https://stackoverflow.com/q/16244745> but i look forward to hearing what others have to say about this. there are few answers there that may be interesting for you"
2082,2019-05-11T17:03:24.321400,Zelma,what’s the best way to initialize a string that is getting returned inside a Class’s `def __str__(self)`?
2082,2019-05-11T17:05:59.323100,Zelma,None
2082,2019-05-11T17:11:38.324600,Zelma,"was intending that to be ignored/psuedocode, but maybe it matters?"
2082,2019-05-11T17:11:57.325400,Zelma,in this case it iterates over a list and += to the string
2082,2019-05-11T17:12:23.325900,Bethany,"and you want the start value to be empty? you can use `s= """"`"
2082,2019-05-11T17:12:45.326200,Zelma,okay thanks <@Bethany>!
2082,2019-05-11T17:13:16.327100,Zelma,"wasn’t sure if that was the best practice, I guess it is the same as `s = str()`"
2082,2019-05-11T17:29:15.329000,Zelma,"I see, the latter would be string types and None nonetype"
2083,2019-05-11T18:19:57.330100,Brain,I’d rather go with `def transform_in_some_way(some_string='')` and would not initialize anything in __str__.
2084,2019-05-11T18:46:07.331700,Hsiu,I find I typically end up using something simple like `return self.name`.
2085,2019-05-12T00:33:14.333100,Nella,"Why `18/1.8` is `10.0`, but `18 // 1.8` is `9.0`?"
2085,2019-05-12T00:49:31.335400,Sasha,"It's an artifact of floating-point representation. Python thinks that the real answer is something like 9.9999999999999, which it will helpfully round up to print out as ""10.0"", but the floor division forces the number down to 9.
```&gt;&gt;&gt; divmod(18, 1.8)
(9.0, 1.7999999999999996)```"
2085,2019-05-12T00:54:04.335900,Nella,"In the first case, how accurate will Python round up to?"
2085,2019-05-12T00:57:20.336600,Sasha,"Looks like it'll round at the 12th decimal by default:
```1 1.1
2 1.01

4 1.0001
5 1.00001
6 1.000001

Need help.
So, I've got this new task of building an ML based chatbot for a law based firm.
I have no clue about how ML and chatbots work.
Where do I begin?
I need a definitive roadmap"

2087,2019-05-12T05:12:04.341300,Valeri,"<@Scot> I don't understand how `A[1,0]` could actually refer to something"
2087,2019-05-12T05:13:37.341800,Valeri,<@Neely> I really appreciate your help
2087,2019-05-12T05:14:04.342300,Valeri,Let's say I have 3-4 months to accomplish this
2087,2019-05-12T05:14:44.342900,Valeri,Is that reasonable timeline considering that I'm willing to devote 2-3 hours daily to this?
2087,2019-05-12T05:15:40.344000,Valeri,"Also, I would definitely like to go via the basic roadmap and later on figure out if I should use google's libraries"
2087,2019-05-12T05:15:51.344200,Valeri,What say? <@Neely>
2087,2019-05-12T06:20:56.344700,Valeri,Just the APIs
2087,2019-05-12T06:21:10.344900,Valeri,I don't do frontend
2088,2019-05-12T04:24:10.340600,Neely,"Hey waqas, it depends on what you want the chatbot to do. The most common use case is implementing natural language processing (NLP) to an utterance/text message to identify a discrete “intent” e.g. “Hey Siri, what’s the time?” may map to an intent called “lookup-time”. These intents are effectively conversational states, and you can design and control the flow of conversation programmatically by managing these states. I recommend trying out Google’s Dialogflow (<https://dialogflow.com/>) in order to get a better understanding. The good thing about Dialogflow is that the machine learning model is provided for you so that you can just focus on designing the conversational flow. However, if you’re planning to self-learn ML and chatbots from the ground up I can supply you with a learning roadmap :slightly_smiling_face:"
2089,2019-05-12T05:42:59.344300,Neely,"It really depends on how you want the chatbot to perform, and whether the 3-4 month timeline covers just the MVP and/or if you’ll be doing continued maintenance on the chatbot beyond that. Have a thorough chat with your client to make sure your expectations align. It also depends how involved you’ll be across the stack e.g. Will you be developing a frontend, backend and chatbot server? Or just an API endpoint for your client to query?"
2090,2019-05-12T06:05:42.344500,Scot,A is actually a 4x4 matrix.I however solved the assignment.Thanks anyway.
2091,2019-05-12T08:12:05.346600,Pura,"If i have around 1 million ids and i need to pass each one to to a http get request and save the result in a db, how could i do this efficiently?"
2091,2019-05-12T08:16:11.347200,Hiroko,are you hitting the same API with these IDs?
2091,2019-05-12T08:16:42.347600,Hiroko,do the API terms of service allow you to store the results locally?
2091,2019-05-12T08:18:51.347700,Pura,yes same api. the service does allow me to store the result
2091,2019-05-12T08:19:03.347900,Pura,Im jusyt unsure if this is a usecase for multiprocessing
2091,2019-05-12T08:19:17.348100,Pura,or something else like asyncio/aiohttp
2091,2019-05-12T08:19:24.348300,Hiroko,"both, actually"
2091,2019-05-12T08:19:38.348500,Pura,The issue im having with multiprocessing is sharing and synchronising state
2091,2019-05-12T08:19:59.348700,Pura,because the API has terms of rate_limiting and to get around this i create multiple API Accounts and need to switch between them when i hit the limit
2091,2019-05-12T08:20:33.348900,Hiroko,"well, lower your requirements to fit the terms of service?"
2091,2019-05-12T08:20:47.349100,Pura,so i need to synchronise between processes which app it should do and when it should sleep when all accounts hit the limit
2091,2019-05-12T08:21:04.349300,Hiroko,since apparently you’re trying to do a workaround behind the terms of the API service if you’re discussing using multiple accounts
2091,2019-05-12T08:21:45.349500,Pura,yes but they allow for multiple accounts and because i have a large amount of data trying to process all the data using one account would take too long
2091,2019-05-12T08:21:52.349700,Hiroko,:thumbsup:
2091,2019-05-12T08:22:24.349900,Hiroko,"if you don’t have asyncio in your project, check out requests futures"
2091,2019-05-12T08:22:35.350100,Pura,"so im wondering could i achieve the same goal of processing the data using asyncio, instead of multiprocessing"

2091,2019-05-12T08:22:56.350600,Pura,"because i think using async http requests instead would allow me to keep track of the accounts and their rate limit, easier than trying to sync data using mp"
2091,2019-05-12T08:23:21.350800,Pura,and which method would be more efficient
2091,2019-05-12T08:25:00.351100,Pura,my main problem with mp is communicating between processes which apps are available.

2094,2019-05-12T14:09:04.357100,Chester,What makes you think that none of these are lists?
2094,2019-05-12T14:09:23.357300,Priscilla,because they are all strings
2094,2019-05-12T14:10:38.357500,Chester,What makes you think so? :slightly_smiling_face:
2094,2019-05-12T14:13:22.357700,Sasha,"""When in doubt, print it out.""  :wink:"
2095,2019-05-12T14:58:00.360000,Sasha,"As pasted, the code has some messed-up indents (misalignment between `if` and `else`). Is the original different?"
2095,2019-05-12T15:00:05.361100,Sasha,"I'm a little suspicious that you have the `sleep()` before the write, instead of between the write and the read."
2095,2019-05-12T15:02:45.363300,Priscilla,"that was not my intention, but it did not fix the issue when placed correctly, in beteeen the write and read but thank you for pointing that out, also those indents come from the formatter, I took them out and were also not the culprit because i thought that too"
2095,2019-05-12T15:03:04.363800,Chester,I suppose `read_until` blocks until the specified byte string is in the buffer
2095,2019-05-12T15:03:28.364500,Chester,Not sure why you check for its presence later.  It will always be true
2095,2019-05-12T15:03:58.365400,Sasha,"I'm guessing that `read_until()` might not block, but just doesn't consume any text after the target string."
2095,2019-05-12T15:04:56.366400,Priscilla,i guess i could put that `read_until()` in its own if statments right? or remove the if statements and use only try and except
2095,2019-05-12T15:05:34.367300,Sasha,The obvious next debugging step is to print out `read_ser_menu` to see what it's getting back.
2095,2019-05-12T15:05:38.367400,Priscilla,<@Sasha> that string is the only thing it needs to read
2095,2019-05-12T15:06:40.368600,Priscilla,"i know what its gettting back from a terminal monitor called docklight, i am sending the same commands there and viewing real time output. do you think that there could be a difference between the programs?"
2095,2019-05-12T15:06:45.368800,Priscilla,im tring it anywho
2095,2019-05-12T15:09:03.370400,Sasha,"A good general principle when you're debugging a problem that shouldn't be happening is to say, ""Okay, this IS happening, therefore one of my assumptions about what's going on is wrong. How can I test my assumptions?"" In this case, you are assuming that what you see in the terminal is what the Python code is seeing. Test that."
2095,2019-05-12T15:09:48.370800,Priscilla,"good point, on it"
2095,2019-05-12T15:14:30.371500,Sasha,What exception?
2095,2019-05-12T15:16:52.372000,Priscilla,"i fixed it, formatting was bad"
2095,2019-05-12T15:17:27.373100,Priscilla,"and i couldnt find a list of the exceptions, only 2 examples, so i defined my own"
2095,2019-05-12T15:17:36.373400,Sasha,(This is one reason why people discourage catch-all `except` clauses. They catch even syntax errors.)
2095,2019-05-12T15:17:52.373600,Priscilla,oh
2095,2019-05-12T15:19:56.374100,Priscilla,how do i find the list of exceptions I can call? should be in the docs right?
2095,2019-05-12T15:21:52.374800,Sasha,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html>
2095,2019-05-12T15:21:56.374900,Karoline,"It's in the docs, but the general idea is, find out what exception you are expecting, and catch that."
2095,2019-05-12T15:22:17.375600,Karoline,"And if you have to for some reason cast a wide net like this, make sure you are logging the exception you caught"
2095,2019-05-12T15:22:32.376000,Karoline,"because it's easy to make assumptions about why you think you got there, but best to know for sure"
2095,2019-05-12T15:29:18.377100,Priscilla,ok i think i understand
2095,2019-05-12T15:32:56.377600,Priscilla,oh yeah that really helped. have more understandable error output
2096,2019-05-12T15:46:34.378800,Priscilla,"weird, its reading 2 blank lines"
2096,2019-05-12T15:49:16.378900,Priscilla,None
2096,2019-05-12T15:53:19.380000,Sasha,Are you hitting a timeout? What's the port timeout set to?
2096,2019-05-12T15:56:40.380500,Sasha,Note that the `SerialTimeoutException` will only be raised on writes. Read timeouts just return less data than expected.

2096,2019-05-12T15:59:23.382600,Karoline,cron works.  alternatively I've used stuff like Azure's Data Factory in the past as well.
2096,2019-05-12T16:07:26.384100,Karoline,It might be a bit overkill if all you really need is to scrape at specific intervals.

2098,2019-05-12T19:57:20.395400,Priscilla,"that was my thought, trying to place `port.flushInput()`and `port.flushInput()` in the correct place"
2098,2019-05-12T19:57:33.395800,Priscilla,i think just before it writes
2098,2019-05-12T20:23:13.395900,Priscilla,so i figured out that its now printing the characters that come before the expected output. which actually is that mess of data.
2098,2019-05-12T20:23:28.396500,Priscilla,i just dont know why its printing that out now
2098,2019-05-12T20:27:35.397300,Sasha,Couldn't say. There's `port.in_waiting` if you want to check the number of bytes queued in the read buffer.
2098,2019-05-12T22:07:50.397800,Priscilla,this device is just not working as they said it would :triumph:
2098,2019-05-13T00:28:39.400000,Priscilla,Custom. Most of it is reverse engineered over the decades. In a long chain of engineers. 
2098,2019-05-13T00:29:59.400800,Priscilla,very little documentation for sure. 
2099,2019-05-12T19:34:18.387700,Sasha,Depends on the protocol... do you expect anything non-ASCII?
2100,2019-05-12T22:48:14.398800,Sasha,"Is it a commercial device where you'd expect it to behave reliably and have public documentation, or a custom gizmo that's still in beta?"
2100,2019-05-13T00:37:41.402100,Sasha,"Sounds like an opportunity for disruption, heh heh. Need someone to redesign this thing's controller board and firmware?  :wink:"
2101,2019-05-13T00:46:18.402200,Neely,"In that case, see what the experience is like with Google Dialogflow first. Then try out another alternative called Rasa (<https://rasa.com/>) which is open source and more flexible. If you really want to get familiar with the underlying ML concepts driving these chatbots from scratch, I suggest auditing one of the many free online courses on either Udacity, Coursera or YouTube. The main concepts around ML I think you should focus on are “supervised learning”, “recurrent neural networks”, “word embeddings”, and “reinforcement learning”. If you have a decent grasp of probability, statistics and differential calculus then you should be able to get stuck into it right away. I also suggest taking a cursory look at “speech act theory” to give you an idea of how people generally structure chatbot conversations."

2107,2019-05-13T09:40:04.419400,Eliana,have you tried anything <@Bao>?
2107,2019-05-13T09:40:11.419700,Claudine,`/(\$.*\b/`
2107,2019-05-13T09:40:19.420100,Claudine,but without examples that might not work
2107,2019-05-13T09:40:20.420300,Bao,"re.findall(r'[^$]\b+', line)"
2107,2019-05-13T09:40:22.420500,Eliana,we also like to see existing attempts and help guide to the answer.
2107,2019-05-13T09:40:38.421000,Bao,I tried above but not luck :disappointed:
2107,2019-05-13T09:40:47.421200,Claudine,your `\b+` just finds multiple word breaks
2107,2019-05-13T09:41:00.421600,Claudine,your `[^$]` finds anthing NOT a $
2107,2019-05-13T09:41:22.422100,Claudine,"you want `\$` to match a $ char, else `$` on it's own matches EOL"
2107,2019-05-13T09:43:30.423400,Bao,I tried '\$' but didn't find any
2107,2019-05-13T09:44:02.423600,Claudine,do you have an example line?
2107,2019-05-13T09:44:29.423900,Bao,"public static string ApiUrlBase = ""<https://api>${API_Host}.<http://some.com/svc/${Slot_version}/%22;\n|some.com/svc/${Slot_version}/"";\n>'"
2107,2019-05-13T09:44:49.424200,Claudine,ahh yea `\b` wont wokr because there's no word break
2107,2019-05-13T09:45:12.424500,Claudine,is it always going to be `api.{API HOST}.some`?
2107,2019-05-13T09:45:39.425300,Bao,yes in few lines
2107,2019-05-13T09:45:44.425400,Claudine,and is that a typo? is it `api.{HOST}` or literally `api{HOST}`?
2107,2019-05-13T09:47:12.426500,Claudine,if your string is literally `<https://api>${API_Host}.<http://some.com/svc/${Slot_version}|some.com/svc/${Slot_version}>` then `/\$\{API_Host\}/` will work
2107,2019-05-13T09:47:41.427200,Claudine,I assumed you meant `${API_HOST}` to be a placeholder in your example
2107,2019-05-13T09:48:42.428300,Bao,"No, i'm looking for all string in line starts with ""${"" and ends with ""}"""
2107,2019-05-13T09:49:54.428500,Claudine,`/\$\{.*?\}/`
2107,2019-05-13T09:51:08.429300,Claudine,"but that will also match `${Slot_version}`, but if you use capture groups you can maybe get arround that..."
2107,2019-05-13T09:51:22.429800,Bao,"This worked ""re.findall('\$\{.*?\}', line)"""

2108,2019-05-13T10:09:00.432700,Avis,Hey is there a way to exclude elements in a list when running a for loop ?
2108,2019-05-13T10:11:20.433100,Karoline,you can have a list comprehension be where your iterable is
2108,2019-05-13T10:11:44.433900,Holly,"that or a conditional, if the element == X pass"
2108,2019-05-13T10:11:44.434000,Karoline,`for thing in [t for t in things if t is not None]:` for example
2108,2019-05-13T10:12:02.434600,Holly,list comprehension is the smaller way :slightly_smiling_face:
2108,2019-05-13T10:12:28.435200,Cindy,"it may be smaller, but has overhead incurred."
2108,2019-05-13T10:12:30.435400,Cindy,"Since you're already iterating, can't you just add a condition to `continue` if you found a criteria for exclusion?"
2108,2019-05-13T10:12:50.435700,Karoline,"it's unfortunate that you can't just use the syntax directly in the for loop, but oh well"
2108,2019-05-13T10:14:11.436800,Clemmie,Will it work with the walrus operator in 3.8? Seems like it maybe would
2108,2019-05-13T10:14:17.437100,Holly,"what is the overhead on list comprehensions like?  I honestly never use them because I haven't spent enough time really learning them and they hurt my brain, so I do them the long way"
2108,2019-05-13T10:14:45.438200,Clemmie,"not a ton, but you are recreating the list that you already have and are iterating through, so it is overhead you don’t need at all"
2108,2019-05-13T10:14:53.438800,Cindy,"<@Holly> you're filtering ahead eagerly, then going through the result again."
2108,2019-05-13T10:15:23.439400,Avis,cool thanks all  I'll give it a try basically I have list 1 and list 2 and I need to exclude all the elements that are common in both
2108,2019-05-13T10:15:47.440300,Hiroko,"<@Cindy> actually, its one filter operation per loop block"
2108,2019-05-13T10:15:53.440600,Avis,and run the for loop on the rest
2108,2019-05-13T10:16:24.441700,Clemmie,ah - you should use set logic (assuming it is ok to remove duplicates)
2108,2019-05-13T10:16:25.441800,Hiroko,I would be very surprised if the loop results in executing the filter op each time
2108,2019-05-13T10:16:47.442300,Cindy,"yes i meant once, but eagerly, up front."
2108,2019-05-13T10:17:10.442900,Karoline,"certainly worth being aware of, but probably not a concern for most people"
2108,2019-05-13T10:35:38.444000,Claudine,never heard it called the walrus
2109,2019-05-13T10:36:25.444200,Clemmie,"`:`eyes, `=` tusk"
2109,2019-05-13T10:36:29.444400,Clemmie,`:=`

2109,2019-05-13T10:38:36.445100,Rodrick,How would I call a class in another python program
2109,2019-05-13T10:38:41.445300,Rodrick,Here is an example
2109,2019-05-13T10:39:14.446200,Rodrick,in the python program `storage.py` i have a class called `Storage`
2109,2019-05-13T10:39:21.446500,Claudine,"```import storage

foo = Storage()
```"
2109,2019-05-13T10:39:41.447100,Rodrick,Thats it?
2109,2019-05-13T10:39:45.447500,Holly,`storage.Storage`
2109,2019-05-13T10:39:45.447600,Hiroko,:yep:
2109,2019-05-13T10:39:49.447900,Rodrick,Wow
2109,2019-05-13T10:39:54.448300,Claudine,well then `foo` would be an instance of storage yep
2109,2019-05-13T10:40:00.448800,Holly,as long as they're in the same folder its that simple yep
2109,2019-05-13T10:40:04.449000,Rodrick,I thought it would be harder than that
2109,2019-05-13T10:40:14.449900,Rodrick,Wow thanks guys
2109,2019-05-13T10:40:17.450100,Claudine,:thumbsup:
2109,2019-05-13T10:41:03.451100,Hiroko,"if its in another place, you’d do `from some_top_level_package.some_inner_packagage.storage import Storage`"
2109,2019-05-13T10:41:10.451300,Rodrick,ahhh ok
2109,2019-05-13T10:43:10.451700,Claudine,"or add that folder to your system path, but i think that's not the best practice"
2109,2019-05-13T10:43:48.451900,Rodrick,Yea
2109,2019-05-13T11:18:01.452300,Rodrick,Any help would be nice
2109,2019-05-13T11:23:29.454300,Rodrick,None
2109,2019-05-13T11:29:54.455200,Clemmie,"yeah, you need an instance of keywords, or make analyze a class method (likely the first)."
2109,2019-05-13T11:30:15.455300,Clemmie,None
2109,2019-05-13T11:30:25.455800,Rodrick,Ok I will try that
2109,2019-05-13T11:31:33.456200,Rodrick,`__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'keyword'` Getting this now
2109,2019-05-13T11:31:44.456400,Rodrick,Code is the same
2109,2019-05-13T11:32:35.457300,Clemmie,"ah, yes, when you initialize `Keyword()` it looks like it wants a keyword to set to `self.keyword` sorry i missed that"
2109,2019-05-13T11:34:15.458000,Rodrick,So do I need to re-initilize a `self.Keyword`?
2109,2019-05-13T11:34:36.458600,Clemmie,lets take a step back - what are you trying to do with this class?
2109,2019-05-13T11:35:30.459500,Rodrick,"I needs to read in a string, process it and return either true or false"
2109,2019-05-13T11:35:58.460100,Clemmie,"ok, what does “process it” mean, and what is `self.keywrod` supposed to hold?"
2109,2019-05-13T11:37:29.461300,Rodrick,processing the string is basically checking to see if it has certain attributes and then based on the conditions it will return true or false
2109,2019-05-13T11:38:51.463000,Rodrick,`self.keyword` is holding the keyword. And I am new to classes so this may seem like a dumb question but if I am only defining the `analyze` def in the class do i need the `self.keyword = keyword`
2109,2019-05-13T11:38:59.463300,Rodrick,in the `__init__`
2109,2019-05-13T11:39:22.463700,Clemmie,is the keyword the condition you are searching for in a given string?
2109,2019-05-13T11:40:04.464300,Rodrick,Ahhhh I see one moment that code is confusing let me fix it one moment
2109,2019-05-13T11:40:19.464600,Clemmie,hold on…
2109,2019-05-13T11:40:32.465000,Clemmie,Lets talk it through first
2109,2019-05-13T11:40:43.465300,Clemmie,"you might not need a class, it might be simpler (or harder)"
2109,2019-05-13T11:40:50.465500,Rodrick,Ok
2109,2019-05-13T11:41:13.466700,Eliana,it can be useful to leave out the implementation details and mainly discuss the problem.
2109,2019-05-13T11:41:20.466900,Clemmie,conceptually what are you thinking `self.keyword` will represent?
2109,2019-05-13T11:41:27.467100,Rodrick,well I am using a class because I want the keywords function in another program
2109,2019-05-13T11:41:36.467400,Clemmie,you can import functions too
2109,2019-05-13T11:41:44.468000,Clemmie,everything in python is an object and can be imported
2109,2019-05-13T11:42:39.468400,Holly,`from Keywords import analyze`
2109,2019-05-13T11:42:51.468700,Rodrick,It will represent a string where the keywords will be taken out
2109,2019-05-13T11:43:03.469000,Rodrick,so if my string is `Hello how are you`
2109,2019-05-13T11:43:27.469600,Rodrick,"It will cut it up into `hello`, `how`, `are`, `you`"
2109,2019-05-13T11:44:43.470100,Rodrick,Hold up
2109,2019-05-13T11:44:49.470400,Rodrick,Oh i fixed it
2109,2019-05-13T11:44:51.470600,Rodrick,yay
2109,2019-05-13T11:45:18.471400,Rodrick,so i removed the `self.keyword` funtion which was giving me the error
2109,2019-05-13T11:45:34.471700,Clemmie,it did look superfluous
2109,2019-05-13T11:45:39.472000,Rodrick,yea
2109,2019-05-13T11:45:43.472200,Clemmie,but now you don’t need the  calss
2109,2019-05-13T11:46:40.473400,Clemmie,`analyze` (or more preferably  `does_string_meet_conditions`) can be a standalone function
2109,2019-05-13T11:47:13.474000,Rodrick,Yea now I get what you are saying
2109,2019-05-13T11:47:23.474200,Clemmie,:thumbsup:

2112,2019-05-13T16:09:29.479900,Walton,question on how to pull a string of characters but ignore spaces
2112,2019-05-13T16:09:58.480400,Walton,"typo, i meant text = ""your string"""
2112,2019-05-13T16:11:32.480600,Hiroko,use `replace`
2112,2019-05-13T16:11:43.480900,Hiroko,"eg `text.replace(' ', '')`"
2112,2019-05-13T16:18:10.481500,Walton,"ok, so i'd have to edit the string and then call for the 6 characters?"
2112,2019-05-13T16:21:26.481800,Hiroko,"`text.replace(' ', '')[:6]`?"
2112,2019-05-13T16:22:25.482000,Walton,ah ok
2112,2019-05-13T16:22:44.482500,Walton,but can I do this without editing 'your string'
2112,2019-05-13T16:23:13.483400,Walton,"basically i'm whipping up usernames, and need to consider people with last names like, ""de la santos"""
2112,2019-05-13T16:23:38.484100,Walton,"but I don't want to manipulate the last name, i just want to use their name as a basis for a userid"

2112,2019-05-13T16:28:41.488000,Clemmie,5 to give each day
2112,2019-05-13T16:28:49.488300,Clemmie,no rollover

2112,2019-05-13T16:29:01.488700,Clemmie,yup
2112,2019-05-13T16:29:05.488900,Walton,I want my taco back

2112,2019-05-13T16:41:39.491700,Walton,"ok, another newbish question. I want to add a 1 to the string. but i dont really want to convert it, because later on I need to see if this UID already exists, and if it does, go back an increment by 1, and repeat until the UID is unique.  is there an easy method?"
2112,2019-05-13T16:42:15.492300,Walton,I already get an error for names without spaces... but I can deal with that
2112,2019-05-13T16:45:26.492600,Walton,Nevermind i think I figured it out
2112,2019-05-13T16:45:38.492900,Walton,str(&lt;number&gt;)
2112,2019-05-13T16:53:00.494100,Clemmie,"you can do that, but it is fragile. It is setting you up for a collision/possibly infinite lookups if  two people with the same last name are trying to sign up at the same time"
2112,2019-05-13T16:57:48.495500,Walton,"Ah well, the way it works, it shouldn't. It goes row by row, ties together the lastname[:4] +first name [:2] + str(1), then it will do an ldap query. make sure its ....oh"
2112,2019-05-13T16:57:55.495700,Walton,crap
2112,2019-05-13T16:58:04.495900,Walton,wait i can fix that
2112,2019-05-13T16:59:23.497100,Walton,"with that replace thing, whats the equivalent of OR... could I do x.replace(' ' OR ' OR `, '')"
2112,2019-05-13T16:59:53.497600,Walton,"maybe .replace (' ' || ' || `,'')"
2112,2019-05-13T17:00:28.498200,Clemmie,"what are you trying to do, in words? that is unclear as pseudo-code"
2112,2019-05-13T17:00:51.498400,Walton,I need to account for the O'Malleys
2112,2019-05-13T17:01:07.498700,Walton,as before it was for the De Los Santos
2112,2019-05-13T17:01:17.499000,Walton,this time i'm protecting the code against the irish
2112,2019-05-13T17:02:09.499700,Walton,So Timothy O'Malley for a proposed UID should be omallet
2112,2019-05-13T17:03:33.000600,Clemmie,"yeah, you need to check if all chars are alpha - you _do_ want what I was showing earlier - `"""".join([x for x in text if x.isalpha()])`"
2112,2019-05-13T17:05:02.001400,Clemmie,"you probably also want to set you entire uid to lower, so `uid= &lt;get uid logic&gt;.lower()`"
2112,2019-05-13T17:07:39.002400,Walton,"so in your example, what would the 2nd x be? as that'd be a variable"
2112,2019-05-13T17:08:15.003200,Walton,i just confused myself
2112,2019-05-13T17:09:02.004100,Walton,"What I am doing right now , using OpenPyxl"
2112,2019-05-13T17:10:06.005500,Clemmie,"that is a list comprehension - it is making a list of characters `x` with the for loop `x in text` (strings are iterable) and it tests if each `x.isalpha()` before it adds it to the list. This gives you a list of chars that are then `join`ed with the character `""""` as the joining string"
2112,2019-05-13T17:13:17.005800,Walton,gotcha. so my final string should look like
2112,2019-05-13T17:14:10.006200,Clemmie,close
2112,2019-05-13T17:16:42.006300,Clemmie,this assumes you are using python 3.6+. If you are under 3.6 replace the f string with the correct string formatting for your version
2112,2019-05-13T17:17:34.007200,Walton,"oh, thats completely different from my 2nd answer :stuck_out_tongue:"
2112,2019-05-13T17:17:59.007500,Clemmie,"there are also superfluous paren in mine, one sec"
2112,2019-05-13T17:17:59.007600,Walton,None
2112,2019-05-13T17:18:34.008100,Walton,yours makes much more sense
2112,2019-05-13T17:19:03.008700,Clemmie,"it might take some tweaking - I copy/paste, didn’t read it too closely, but you get the gist I think. gotta run - good luck!"
2112,2019-05-13T17:19:22.008900,Walton,Thanks so much!
2113,2019-05-13T17:08:25.003500,Walton,"what is x, is an easier question"
2114,2019-05-13T18:35:30.012800,Ashely,"hey all.  I'm stumbling my way through writing a script to alert me when an item comes back in stock, using beautifulsoup. I'm stuck on a problem diving down into elements in the page.

2114,2019-05-13T18:38:04.014600,Ashely,Any suggestions as to why bs4 isn't pulling that from the div?
2114,2019-05-13T18:46:22.015400,Ashely,"(edited code above, searching divs not spans)"
2114,2019-05-13T18:56:27.016200,Sasha,I wonder if the bs4 parser is getting confused by the quotes-within-quotes used in that tag. Does the tag output include those correctly?

2114,2019-05-13T19:02:40.016800,Ashely,"You meant in the script, or in the browser?  Above is the script output"
2114,2019-05-13T19:04:59.017300,Sasha,"Cool, looks like it's transforming the quotes correctly."
2114,2019-05-13T19:11:07.018000,Sasha,Is there any chance that the `span` content you want is being dynamically inserted by Javascript in the browser and isn't actually in the HTML you're feeding to bs4?
2115,2019-05-13T20:07:39.018300,Karol,guys where is the error:
2115,2019-05-13T20:14:19.020900,Sasha,That's peculiar. Any chance you have a `pandas.py` file in your directory that might be masking the real Pandas library? Can you `print(pd.read_csv)` to see what Python thinks that is?
2115,2019-05-13T20:23:19.022800,Karol,"prints the route of the file , this is very weird I'm using collaboratory"
2115,2019-05-13T20:27:34.023000,Sasha,Any chance that it's remembering something from a previous session where you accidentally typed `pd.read_csv = ...`?
2115,2019-05-13T20:29:34.023200,Karol,no chance I closed and reopen it
2115,2019-05-13T20:32:38.023400,Sasha,"I'm out of ideas, I'm afraid, beyond ""Collaboratory is weirdly broken"".  :sweat:"

2115,2019-05-13T20:34:41.023800,Sasha,¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2115,2019-05-13T20:55:05.025100,Ashely,"<@Sasha> Sorry, broke for dinner.  I'm a little embarassed to say I have no idea, or how to find out.  I'll dig into it.  If it is dynamically generated, any suggestion for how you'd pull it in to a script?"
2115,2019-05-13T20:59:54.026000,Sasha,One way to test is to turn off Javascript in your browser and see what the page source looks like in that case. You can also try printing out the data that you're giving to bs4.
2115,2019-05-13T21:00:51.027100,Sasha,"If it is dynamically generated, you're in more <#C5PHT9EGK|webscraping> territory, and might need to use something like Selenium to behave more like a browser."
2115,2019-05-13T21:05:43.028000,Ashely,"Yep, sure enough.  The 'out of stock' button the span element sits on top of doesn't even load.  Good call."
2115,2019-05-13T21:06:07.028500,Ashely,I'll take my case to the scrapers.  Thanks for the point in the right direction.

```concurrent.futures._base.TimeoutError```

Why is it timing out and not waking after 900s"
2119,2019-05-14T07:23:04.042400,Chester,"If you need to sleep in asyncio-based apps, you should use `asyncio.sleep` instead"
2119,2019-05-14T07:23:20.042800,Chester,"Also, shameless plug: <https://github.com/malinoff/aionursery>"
2120,2019-05-14T08:21:43.043400,Pura,What if i needed the entire process to sleep because i need to wait until some rate limit has reset.
2120,2019-05-14T08:21:58.043600,Chester,"Uhm, why?"
2120,2019-05-14T08:22:13.043900,Pura,I need to wait until the rate limit has reset before continuing with the tasks
2120,2019-05-14T08:22:23.044100,Pura,so i set a sleep to try and do this
2120,2019-05-14T08:23:14.044800,Chester,"You still want the event loop to roll. With `time.sleep` you essentially block everything from running, including various IO readiness checks, which is really really bad. You don't want to do this in asyncio-based application"
2120,2019-05-14T08:24:35.045000,Pura,Okay
2120,2019-05-14T08:37:24.045300,Pura,but if i need to have some feature to wait for 15 minutes before continuning running of the tasks/co-routines how could i do this
2120,2019-05-14T08:38:03.045500,Pura,pause all tasks for 15 minutes depending on some condition
2120,2019-05-14T08:39:16.046000,Chester,RDS
2120,2019-05-14T08:39:47.046100,Chester,It's kind of weird requirement. What if one of the tasks is in the middle of DB transaction?
2120,2019-05-14T08:41:34.046900,Pura,ye true
2120,2019-05-14T08:41:41.047200,Tatum,I'm currently on GCS.
2120,2019-05-14T08:41:42.047300,Pura,there must be a better way to seperate this code then
2120,2019-05-14T08:42:10.047800,Chester,GCS? Google cloud?
2120,2019-05-14T08:42:12.047900,Karoline,I imagine they have a similar managed DB service.
2120,2019-05-14T08:42:44.049100,Tatum,Yup. I'll take a poke around. It may be worth migrating to AWS as you can't take chances with backing up data. Thanks!
2120,2019-05-14T08:43:00.049500,Pura,because i need someway to pause these operations because my app is rate limited
2120,2019-05-14T08:43:15.050100,Tatum,"Yes, Google Cloud Services"
2120,2019-05-14T08:43:43.050700,Chester,I'd say you don't need to pause operations. You need to stop scheduling operations when you face a rate limiting action.
2120,2019-05-14T08:43:45.050900,Karoline,"at this point with RDS we're comfortable enough with the restore process that we actually use it for troubleshooting as well - we'll replicate prod for really hard to reproduce issues and test against that, it's stupid easy."
2120,2019-05-14T08:44:43.051600,Chester,"RDS is also nice because it's your lovely postgres under the hood. There is no vendor lock-in, really.
You can just `pg_dump` your whole data any time, and migrate somewhere else"
2120,2019-05-14T08:44:56.051900,Pura,hmm interesting what if the operation youre currently on faced a rate limit action and you need to repeat it?
2120,2019-05-14T08:45:32.053100,Karoline,We also had to increase the size of our prod database and it was as easy as editing the size of of disk allocated to it.  It's an incredible product really.
2120,2019-05-14T08:45:46.053500,Chester,Put it in a waiting queue; replay the queue when it's possible
2120,2019-05-14T08:46:10.054600,Chester,I wish all aws products were like RDS...
2120,2019-05-14T08:46:16.054900,Hiroko,so I doubt you need to go from GC to AWS just for this thing
2120,2019-05-14T08:46:27.055200,Karoline,haha yeah it definitely stands out as one of their best designed.  not everything is so nice for sure
2120,2019-05-14T08:46:44.056000,Karoline,"yeah my guess is there's something similar on google, it's pretty fundamental"
2120,2019-05-14T08:46:57.056300,Pura,"At the moment i scheduled operations in batches like this

```
   for i, batch in enumerate(batches):
            tasks = [asyncio.ensure_future(fetch_user_objects(apps, session, user_id=users, tweet_mode=""extended"")) for users in batch]
            for t in tasks:
                d = await t
```

Do you recommend another method? i batch request 10 at a time otherwise the process is so slow"
2120,2019-05-14T08:47:39.057400,Tatum,Thanks guys! Much appreciated. I found GCS has had to list their matching services with AWS. <https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/map-aws-google-cloud-platform>
2120,2019-05-14T08:48:49.057900,Karoline,"awesome, I'd be curious to hear your experience after you play with it for a bit."
2120,2019-05-14T08:49:14.058700,Karoline,"also, don't forget, you don't really have a backup until you've restored from it.  so make sure you test out your restore process."
2120,2019-05-14T08:51:55.060300,Tatum,So true. I recently tried a backup script and couldn't restore it. :scream_cat: Luckily it was all fake data I inserted in a development environment
2120,2019-05-14T08:52:15.060400,Chester,I guess `asyncio.gather` would be easier
2120,2019-05-14T08:52:57.061000,Pura,i mean how would you implement the “stop scheduling if the fetch_user_object” hit a rate limit action
2120,2019-05-14T08:53:33.061600,Chester,"People can be in three groups:
• ones who don't make backups yet
• ones who do
• ones who test restoration procedure"
2120,2019-05-14T08:53:33.061700,Pura,"ah the problem is that rate limit action might be for 1 app, but i need to stop scheduling if all the apps hit the rate limit"
2120,2019-05-14T08:53:42.062100,Karoline,haha yes.
2120,2019-05-14T08:53:50.062500,Karoline,"oh, and people who think RAID is backup.  lol"
2120,2019-05-14T08:54:36.062600,Pura,"the `fetch_user_objects` takes in `apps` as a parameter so i could check to see if all apps are rate limited in this function by adding some flag and if they are return some error response.

i would have to make apps a global variable so that the state is persisted?"
2120,2019-05-14T08:54:37.062800,Chester,"&gt; how would you implement the “stop scheduling if the fetch_user_object” hit a rate limit action
Just put a `await asyncio.sleep()` right before your `asyncio.ensure_future` calls."
2120,2019-05-14T08:55:06.063300,Chester,I guess they fall into the first group :slightly_smiling_face:
2120,2019-05-14T08:55:10.063400,Pura,i only sleep based on some condition that would be sleeping before everything?
2120,2019-05-14T08:57:19.063900,Chester,"Sure, you need to do a conditional sleep. Is that a problem? :slightly_smiling_face:"
2120,2019-05-14T08:57:49.064100,Pura,yes because i need to return a response from one of these ensure futures first
2120,2019-05-14T08:58:04.064300,Chester,"```
    for i, batch in enumerate(batches):
        if rate_limited():
            await asyncio.sleep(some_time)
        tasks = [asyncio.ensure_future(fetch_user_objects(apps, session, user_id=users, tweet_mode=""extended"")) for users in batch]
        for t in tasks:
            d = await t
```"
2120,2019-05-14T08:58:58.064900,Pura,and this rate_limited() function could loop through all the apps and check if the flag self.rate_limit = True
2120,2019-05-14T08:59:21.065100,Pura,this self.rate_limit = True is set within `fetch_user_objects` if it hits a 429 error from the http request
2120,2019-05-14T09:00:23.065800,Pura,"the last problem i think i see here is… this ensure_future is batch of 10 requests. If in the 5th request everything is rate limited, i would need to sleep…"
2120,2019-05-14T09:03:13.069100,Chester,"Alright, so this is a problem only if the remaining tasks haven't made rate-limited requests yet. Because if they already made requests, then they weren't really rate limited, right? Otherwise the remaining tasks will fail with some exception like `HttpTooManyRequests` - which is fine, because you can re-schedule failed tasks to the next batch"
2120,2019-05-14T09:04:02.069400,Chester,"But if the remaining tasks have made their requests, and they were not rate limited, then you don't care about them - they are free to go and save data to a db. You don't need to do anything with them, just let them finish"
2120,2019-05-14T09:06:20.070700,Linnea,I am following this article
2120,2019-05-14T09:08:07.071100,Linnea,<https://help.github.com/en/articles/enabling-branch-restrictions>
2120,2019-05-14T09:08:50.071900,Chester,"By default, nobody can push to your repository except for you."
2120,2019-05-14T09:10:25.073300,Chester,"You can add collaborators with different permissions (basically, ""write"" and ""admin"")"
2120,2019-05-14T09:11:01.073900,Chester,"So if you don't add anyone to your repo - you're good, others can only try to push their code through PRs"
2120,2019-05-14T09:15:45.075000,Pura,"yes, how do you reccomend rescheduling failed tasks.

`d = await t`

should i check the response of `d` and then retry based on that response and is there already a way to retry easily using asyncio?"
2120,2019-05-14T09:17:11.075300,Chester,"&gt; should i check the response of `d` and then retry based on that response
Yep. If there's an exception, you'll need `try`/`except` over `d = await t`"
2120,2019-05-14T09:18:16.076500,Linnea,It seems they all have push access by default. There is no place to change permissions for collaborators
2120,2019-05-14T09:19:01.076900,Pura,"ahh okay, ye there is no exception in my fetch_user_objects i have

```
if response['status'] != 200:
        app.rate_limited = True
        return {'errors': 'failed job'}
```

so i could look for `d['errors']` or maybe return some status"
2120,2019-05-14T09:20:02.077800,Pura,"im just not sure how i would go about rescheudling this task then.

```
for task in tasks:
    res = await task
```

task i believe is the future/co-routine"
2120,2019-05-14T09:20:53.079100,Chester,"I'd remove users from collaborators. They will be able to make PRs, and it looks like this is what needed"
2120,2019-05-14T09:29:36.082200,Linnea,I have protected the branch and included administrators and it works. It seems Ike the article I have posted above illustrate things that don’t exist. Thank you <@Karoline> <@Chester>

2122,2019-05-14T09:15:35.074900,Linnea,Ooh the repo is having 4 collaborators and I want them to not be able to push but just submit PR
2122,2019-05-14T09:18:25.076800,Chester,Why do you have them as collaborators?

2130,2019-05-14T15:50:51.126700,Raguel,"`if my_dict[test]:` I think this is not evaluating to anything for it to go forward. You are trying to check if key exists, right?"
2130,2019-05-14T15:52:11.127800,Clemmie,it doesn’t know how to evaluate `if my_dict[test]` if you are just checking if a key is in a dict do `if test in my_dict else set a value to the key` and get rid of the try/except
2130,2019-05-14T15:52:13.127900,Romaine,`my_dict.get('test')`?
2130,2019-05-14T15:52:55.129100,Romaine,"```test = my_dict.get('test') or ""abc""```"
2130,2019-05-14T15:53:03.129300,Clemmie,"specifically, it is getting a dataframe, but dataframes don’t support boolean evaluation (apparently)"
2130,2019-05-14T15:53:43.130100,Nenita,<@Raguel> yea
2130,2019-05-14T15:53:46.130200,Romaine,`.get('key')` on a dict returns `None` if the key doesn't exist or is empty
2130,2019-05-14T15:54:04.130400,Nenita,oh nice
2130,2019-05-14T15:54:32.131200,Nenita,"i usually end up using except keyerror as my go-to method, but .get will be way more effective"
2130,2019-05-14T15:55:06.131800,Raguel,"using `.get`, you can give it a default value too instead of `None` as <@Romaine> mentioned"
2130,2019-05-14T15:55:16.132000,Romaine,yup!
2130,2019-05-14T15:56:14.133100,Romaine,"I use the model of `.get('key') or ""default""`, because its sometimes more readable, especially when ""default"" calls another function or complex piece of code"
2130,2019-05-14T15:57:18.134000,Raguel,"and you can try doing the way misthop mentioned as you don't really need try/except here. you can just check key existence, and then decide what to do"
2130,2019-05-14T15:57:52.134500,Nenita,"i always thought the try/except was the way to check if a key exists, but ill surely be using .get from now on"
2130,2019-05-14T16:00:06.135400,Raguel,"but if you use `get`, and when the value exists for that get, your `if` statement will break as there is no boolean evaluation for dataframes"
2130,2019-05-14T16:01:04.136100,Raguel,"when you do `my_dict.get(test)`, it will return that empty dataframe, and `if dataframe` will not evaluate to anything and throw same error"
2130,2019-05-14T16:05:29.136600,Nenita,yea doing that works perfectly

2143,2019-05-15T09:41:28.222500,Hiroko,"if anything, I think logging would be much more flexible"
2143,2019-05-15T09:41:42.222900,Hiroko,because you can then route your log output to a handler which can execute different things
2143,2019-05-15T09:41:56.223200,Hiroko,"eg, send an email with too many ERRORs occurring"
2143,2019-05-15T09:42:01.223400,Hiroko,post to a log aggregator
2143,2019-05-15T09:42:03.223600,Hiroko,etc
2143,2019-05-15T09:42:33.224300,Hiroko,"in other words, <@Clarita> I would kill print in favor of logging just because"
2143,2019-05-15T09:42:51.224900,Hiroko,using lots of print statements over logging in a project is a major code smell to me
2143,2019-05-15T09:44:53.226700,Clarita,"undoubtedly logging is superior for flexibility, can’t argue that. but i’m trying to reduce memory use first and foremost, and since I don’t really know the internals of `print` just wondering if it is somehow a very costly process"
2143,2019-05-15T09:45:18.227300,Hiroko,"print uses the OS system calls, IIRC"
2143,2019-05-15T09:45:24.227600,Hiroko,so its pretty low level
2143,2019-05-15T09:45:33.227900,Clarita,certainly in terms of time print is killing our program
2143,2019-05-15T09:45:47.228400,Hiroko,"FWIW, you really should be using levels in output"
2143,2019-05-15T09:45:53.228800,Hiroko,"eg, INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG"
2143,2019-05-15T09:46:14.229300,Hiroko,sounds like lots of your output is debug and could be avoided with proper logging levels
2143,2019-05-15T09:46:34.230100,Hiroko,"eg, you want one env to have debug output, but not another.  just change the log level in the env config"

2143,2019-05-15T09:55:50.233400,Clarita,and re: logging. I can’t recall if you have log level set to ERROR will a statement like `<http://logging.INFO|logging.INFO>(f'{calculate_string()}')` actually execute and compile that string and not print it? or does it skip the entire line like a no-op?
2143,2019-05-15T09:57:09.233700,Hiroko,logging is a heriarchy
2143,2019-05-15T09:58:09.234500,Karoline,"if you just wanted to test the effect, you could assign like `<http://logging.info|logging.info>` to `print` globally and run your application and observe the difference"
2143,2019-05-15T09:58:26.235000,Karoline,I'd be shocked if it really made a noticeable difference but maybe in some tight loops.

```
times = ['9:00', '9:30', '9:45', '10:15', '10:30', '10:30']
```
and I want to sort them into buckets 9:00-10:00 and 10:00-11:00.

Is there a cleaner/more pythonic way to do this than:

```
time_9am = []
time_10am = []
for a_time in times:
    if a_time &gt;= '9:00' and a_time &lt; '10:00':
         time_9am.append(a_time)
    elif a_time &gt;= '10:00' and a_time &lt; '11:00':
         time_10am.append(a_time)
```"
2145,2019-05-15T11:30:46.240700,Clemmie,you can bucket them by the value in `x.split(':')[0]` which will give you the hour portion of each string
2145,2019-05-15T11:31:09.241300,Magdalena,I'll have a list of dynamic bucket sizes and I could have a bucket size that's like 9:30-11:00
2145,2019-05-15T11:31:17.241700,Clemmie,"bucket them into a dict, where the keys in the dict are the hour portion, the value a list of times"
2145,2019-05-15T11:31:58.242600,Clemmie,"oh, then you will need to use datetime with timedelta"
2145,2019-05-15T11:31:59.242800,Magdalena,"sorry, should have done a little bit better job of explaining, I'll have a list of bucket start and end times"
2145,2019-05-15T11:32:16.243200,Clemmie,also your code is trying to do string comparison - that will not be reliable
2145,2019-05-15T11:32:44.243700,Magdalena,"^  i was too lazy to write out datetime.time(9, 0) for each one sorry"

2145,2019-05-15T11:33:15.245100,Magdalena,but I'll be either working with datetime.time or datetime.datetimes
2145,2019-05-15T11:33:40.245600,Clemmie,"Instead of an if else loop I would make a function that takes in a list of times, a start and end, and returns the list of times that fit in the bucket. then you call the function once for each bucket"
2145,2019-05-15T11:34:09.246300,Clemmie,"and you can have a list of start and end times where each but the first and last is bosth an end/start time, and iterate through the pairs calling the function"
2145,2019-05-15T11:34:29.246700,Clemmie,collapses the whole thing into about 7 lines of code

2159,2019-05-16T03:35:34.296000,Chester,I think `key` should also work. There's `Object.keys()` method
2160,2019-05-16T06:09:22.297000,Malika,Need help scraping a website which has graphql in the url
2160,2019-05-16T06:09:48.297500,Malika,need to know the perfect structure of the request
2160,2019-05-16T06:12:24.298200,Madonna,Do you happen to have an example of what one the urls would look like?
2160,2019-05-16T06:19:32.299600,Conchita,I'm parsing HTTPS requests and I need some flexiblity - I need to allow for certain keys to contain value `None` from time to time
2160,2019-05-16T06:20:54.299700,Conchita,Currently my script breaks if `title = request_json['message']` is `None`. How do I allow for this?
2160,2019-05-16T06:25:48.301600,Madonna,"Assuming that it is blowing up with a `KeyError` should `message` not exist in `request_json`? I would use `get(key, default)` instead of attempting to directly access the potentially non existent key.

E.g.
```
title = request_json.get(""message"", None)
message = request_json.get(""payload"", None)
targets = request_json.get(""targets"", None)
```

This way you get a default value even if the key does not exist, can make the default value whatever you need."
2160,2019-05-16T06:26:51.302100,Madonna,Hopefully that helps :simple_smile:
2160,2019-05-16T07:22:58.303300,Madonna,"Sorry, not really sure what to suggest. I would maybe try using requests library for sending the POST request, and pass a dict representing the query to the `params` argument of the `post` method.

Something like this.

```
import requests

query = {
    ""query"": {""field"": ""value""}

<http://requests.post|requests.post>(url, params=query)

2162,2019-05-16T08:58:59.309900,Bethany,I've had this problem recently where conda install into the base environment broke conda
2162,2019-05-16T08:59:13.310300,Bethany,Like it uninstalled itself
2162,2019-05-16T08:59:37.311000,Nella,So I just need to install again?
2162,2019-05-16T08:59:41.311300,Bethany,But that was by installing an environment file that didn't have it
2162,2019-05-16T08:59:55.311800,Bethany,Yeah but what did you do to break it? What if you do that again?
2162,2019-05-16T09:00:47.312400,Nella,I think I maybe installed something. But I can’y really think of what’s that “something”

2162,2019-05-16T10:29:16.319100,Nella,<@Deloris> That sounds like a great idea. But I just installed miniconda instead.
2162,2019-05-16T10:29:54.320900,Nella,<@Bethany> I previously installed Anaconda using brew
2162,2019-05-16T10:29:57.321000,Deloris,well you don't need to setup any thing just try to download docker image
2162,2019-05-16T10:29:59.321400,Bethany,Miniconda docker image is a great idea btw I use it for almost anything
2162,2019-05-16T10:30:19.321700,Deloris,which is available in docker

2166,2019-05-16T15:17:06.332600,Cherish,"I had some spare time the last few days and wrote something to help myself track unit types (physical unit types, ie `meters` or `º Kelvin`. I essentially wanted to see if I could write the equivalent class to a `float` but have it check &amp; possibly convert units prior to using them for any math. It's done by using a class, `Quantity`, which uses `float` as its base class. Now, if I want to check units before adding 2 Quantities, I can define an `__add__` func which performs the check, and then returns a result if the units are compatible with a call to `self._check_compatibility`.

What I was wondering is, for the return line here, having `super().__add__(o)` looks wrong to me. The code works as I want it to, but I wanted to know if there's a better way of adding to these default class dunder methods where the process you want is: 1- do some check, 2- use the base class's standard method, 3- cast the result to something else

```def __add__(self, other):
    # returns other, unmodified, or converted to a compatible 'Quantity' class
    o = self._check_compatibility(other) 
    # returns the result as the same Quantity class as 'self'
    return self._cast_as_same_unit(super().__add__(o)) ```"

2167,2019-05-16T13:38:00.330500,Sasha,"So, generally this is against the Python philosophy, which says that if the developer wants to add a new attribute, they probably have a good reason for it, so you might want to reconsider why you want to restrict them in this way... especially since any sort of protection can be bypassed by people who have your source code anyway."

2178,2019-05-17T15:04:22.019600,Walton,"oh, I should state that i'm a noob. So to me, a tuple sounds like a yummy type of girlscout cookie."
2178,2019-05-17T15:05:00.020000,Hiroko,easiest way to remove dupes would be to use a set
2178,2019-05-17T15:05:10.020400,Bethany,what does yourcode look like?
2178,2019-05-17T15:05:14.020600,Walton,looked up Tuple! i'm caught up
2178,2019-05-17T15:05:33.021000,Walton,i can share my code... I just hope you haven't had lunch yet :slightly_smiling_face:
2178,2019-05-17T15:05:41.021200,Bethany,"go ahead, we don't bite"
2178,2019-05-17T15:05:55.021500,Bethany,waiting on a long process
2178,2019-05-17T15:11:56.022000,Walton,"And in the portion where my LDAP Loop is, I'm going to add the check for a double entry from column 2."
2178,2019-05-17T15:12:29.022400,Walton,None

2178,2019-05-17T15:16:07.023200,Bethany,you might find it a lot easier to work with pandas dataframes
2178,2019-05-17T15:16:37.024100,Bethany,"then you do whatever you want to the data frame, and read/write to excel at the beginning/end"

I'd like to avoid the problems everyone says Nagios has, but I honestly don't have enough experience with monitoring in general to make a good evaluation of the options out there. I also don't want to lock myself into a terrible choice because it looks shiny. Can I get some recommendations for what you've personally used in the past and what you think the good options are? ""Definitely avoid"" recommendations are also helpful."

2178,2019-05-17T15:21:32.029600,Walton,I dont know what your monitoring nor the platform however
2178,2019-05-17T15:21:45.030000,Carmen,Platform will be Linux.
2178,2019-05-17T15:21:52.030300,Walton,<@Bethany> suggestion for a decent PANDA tutorial?
2178,2019-05-17T15:22:01.031000,Carmen,Monitoring will be everything from server status to app statuses and health checks.
2178,2019-05-17T15:22:14.031700,Bethany,<@Carmen> what's the infrastructure?
2178,2019-05-17T15:22:26.032400,Bethany,like a linux box in house?
2178,2019-05-17T15:22:47.033100,Walton,"<@Carmen> at my last job I built out a 100% redundant Linux based web environment and used Nagios to monitor it with EASE. then expanded and was monitroing windows servers, printers and everything else"
2178,2019-05-17T15:23:25.034800,Walton,"emails got sent out to Office Services to order toner, Admins knew about Storage creep, desktop knew that machines were unresponsive.... what are you trying to monitor?"
2178,2019-05-17T15:23:25.034900,Carmen,"AWS EC2 for the *real* production stuff, though I'll be spinning up one in my local lab server to monitor private VMs, so a SaaS solution isn't really viable."

2178,2019-05-17T15:24:13.036000,Walton,"::taco:: <@Bethany> thanks man, i'll check it out"
2178,2019-05-17T15:24:14.036100,Brain,<@Carmen> you might want to join <http://hangops.slack.com|hangops.slack.com> to ask this question. But I’d look at <https://prometheus.io/>
2178,2019-05-17T15:26:23.037500,Carmen,"<@Walton> I'm planning to monitor VMs almost exclusively. Webapps hosted thereon, and health checks on the servers themselves (disk usage, inode creep, etc.)"
2178,2019-05-17T15:28:38.039800,Walton,"Well VM or bare metal doesn't matter, all that matters is that it has a pulse[IP]. You can monitor everything, from ports, to storage, to logs, to ssh traffic. Basically everything for a production web environment, Nagios has got you covered. That isn't to say Prometheus or any other suggestion is bad, I just have not worked with those at all. As a guy who just started learning python, I had Nagios fully functional for day to day and the DEV team at my last spot, with zero python knowledge."
2178,2019-05-17T15:28:59.040300,Walton,"now if you're talking about centralized logging type monitoring, I'd recommend an ELK stack"
2178,2019-05-17T15:34:09.041700,Carmen,"At the moment, I'm more concerned with making sure everything is alive and not dying rather than metrics tracking. ELK is my target for centralized logging and metrics tracking later on."
2178,2019-05-17T15:42:37.042600,Walton,"well ping is the default module for Nagios. however, to me that means nothing, as a machine can be a vegetable."
2178,2019-05-17T15:42:52.043000,Walton,I'd branch out from there and turn on port monitoring.
2178,2019-05-17T15:43:36.044000,Walton,"for HTTP/S I'd have a healthcheck page and check it for a return to make sure metadata is present, this way you'd know that not only is port 80/443 is open but it is hosting too"
2178,2019-05-17T15:44:13.044500,Walton,you can do SSH monitoring to see if accounts outside a list of accounts is trying to login.
2178,2019-05-17T15:45:05.045600,Walton,"and from there, storage, ram, cpu monitoring. only set it to alert you and your team when there is a problem, and a ""everything works"" alert daily so you know it's all still running"
2178,2019-05-17T15:45:45.046500,Walton,"then with grafana or the built in NAGIOS mappign tool, you can have a dedicated monitor with a topography map of your entire map, looking to see if errors pop up"
2178,2019-05-17T15:46:13.047100,Walton,My apologies to everyone for going off-topic on this. its just the only thing I can actually contribute with at the moment with my current skillset.
2178,2019-05-17T15:47:29.047400,Hiroko,no worries!
2178,2019-05-17T15:47:36.047800,Hiroko,sounds liek a good topic for <#C22DMH61M|devops> :slightly_smiling_face:
2178,2019-05-17T15:48:31.048800,Hiroko,"you make a good point with healthcheck, since it just checks whether a machine is up or not.  It helps to be able to do more, and that’s part of my I take k8s healthcheck with a large grain of salt"
2178,2019-05-17T15:49:14.049200,Walton,"<#C22DMH61M|devops> is the one channel i didn't join, as i'm only here to learn to code"

2178,2019-05-17T17:42:51.057600,Nigel,You can see pip bundled with python here: <https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/e42b705188271da108de42b55d9344642170aa2b/Lib/ensurepip/_bundled>
2179,2019-05-17T16:53:50.051100,Carmen,"<@Walton> :taco: for your advice, it's much appreciated."
2179,2019-05-17T16:54:26.051300,Walton,anytime :slightly_smiling_face:
2179,2019-05-17T17:08:30.055800,Sterling,"The docs tell me to use `python3 -m venv tutorial-env` (<https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>) to create new virtualenvironments. But every time I use this, source the virtualenvironment, and run pip I get a message telling my pip is out of date. I have tried updating pip without have the virtualenvironment active, upgrading pip in virtual environment. But both do not upgrade the version of pip that is installed when I use venv to create my next virtual environment"
2179,2019-05-17T17:09:00.056500,Sterling,"So how do you upgrade the pip package that is being used to create virtualenvironments by venv? Do I have to upgrade venv itself? If so, how?"
2179,2019-05-17T17:43:42.058600,Sterling,thats the exact version I have when I use PIP in venv. 10.0.1. So am I stuck with 10.0.1 on fresh VENV until I update it inside the venv or that cpython gets updated?
2179,2019-05-17T17:44:22.059700,Nigel,"Usually you can install virtualenv as a separate package for your OS, it usually installs the new version of pip"
2179,2019-05-17T17:45:08.061100,Sterling,I used to use virtualenv but recently I saw that python docs were recommending `python3 -m venv tutorial-env`. Do you know if there is any reason why they suggest that module now over virtualenv package I used to use?
2179,2019-05-17T17:45:25.061400,Sterling,The only reason I switched was because docs were using it
2179,2019-05-17T17:46:02.062600,Nigel,"&gt; Do you know if there is any reason why they suggest that module now over virtualenv package I used to use?
The reason is that they'be brought virtualenv into the distribution of python"
2179,2019-05-17T17:46:23.063600,Nigel,"I don't know if I'm correct, but I'm pretty sure about it"
2179,2019-05-17T17:46:49.064400,Nigel,There are also tools which help you with creating virtual environments without thinking too much about them. The best of such tools is called poetry: <https://github.com/sdispater/poetry>
2179,2019-05-17T17:47:02.065000,Sterling,What do you guys use?
2179,2019-05-17T17:47:10.065300,Nigel,It handles virtual environments and packaging
2179,2019-05-17T17:48:01.066800,Nigel,"There is also virtualenvwrapper (<https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>) which I used to use before, and pipenv (<https://github.com/pypa/pipenv>)"
2179,2019-05-17T17:48:31.067500,Brain,"I don’t think you can really solve this in any permanent way. Every time a new version of `pip` releases, you’ll see that message.
It takes time to update that version in `virtualenv`, `venv` and other packages. So, on your system `pip` will always be lagging behind unless you upgrade it right after creating venv."
2179,2019-05-17T17:49:29.068200,Sterling,"Agreed, its a battle of keep up but 10.0.1 visually looks very far behind the 19.* that is current release"
2179,2019-05-17T17:50:47.069900,Brain,debian stable is on 9.0.1 :slightly_smiling_face:
2179,2019-05-17T17:50:48.070100,Sterling,Thanks for explanations on why it ships with 10.0.1. Just have been super curious as to why it installs that version when my system had the latest/greatest
2179,2019-05-17T17:51:38.071200,Sterling,Wow! <@Brain>
2179,2019-05-17T17:56:22.072000,Brain,do you happen to have python2 installed on your machine too?
2179,2019-05-17T18:09:26.072800,Sterling,I do
2179,2019-05-17T18:10:10.073000,Sterling,I have a mac and python2 was preinstalled. But I installed python3 via homebrew. When I rune the venv module though I do run `python3 -m venv new-venv`. Do you think python2 is interfering somehow?
2179,2019-05-17T18:44:18.073900,Sterling,Is there a `PIP_UPDATE_ON_INSTALL=1`? That would be ideal
2180,2019-05-17T18:39:03.073300,Karoline,`PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1`
2181,2019-05-17T19:12:58.075700,Ressie,Hey everyone. Can I get a detailed explanation on this program. I know what it does but just cant understand how it does it
2181,2019-05-17T19:17:06.076100,Ressie,"The code counts the number of times the word ""bob"" appears in the variable s. I just dont know how it does it"
2181,2019-05-17T19:21:29.078100,Sasha,"So, the main `for` loop is looking at every possible starting position for `""bob""` in the string. It might be at position 0, 1, all the way up to 3 characters from the end of the string (since you need to have room for `""bob""` left)."
2181,2019-05-17T19:22:44.079600,Sasha,"Then if it sees a `""b""` at one of those positions, it enters the inner `for` loop, where it checks each character in `""bob""` for a match. It exits the loop immediately if there's a mismatch, but if it completes the loop successfully, the `else` clause fires, and it increments a counter for how many `""bob""`s it has found."
2181,2019-05-17T19:25:31.080700,Sasha,"(I'm assuming you already know stuff like the `[]` notation for array indexing, etc. But feel free to ask about anything that's unclear. The `for-else` syntax is uncommon in other languages, for instance.)"
2181,2019-05-18T00:46:23.081300,Brain,it installs 19.0.3 because even the latest version of python has that version as a constant: <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/8bba81fd55873148c65b7d0e6a6effbd63048c76/Lib/ensurepip/__init__.py#L13>
2182,2019-05-18T00:45:27.081100,Brain,nevermind
2183,2019-05-18T05:44:23.083300,Ressie,"Thanks I finally get how the program functions. Now if you dont mine could you explain :-
1. For x in range(0,len(s)-len(find)+1)... Why is there +1 in that line of code?
2. For I in range(0, len(find)).... could you please explain more on it
Thank you"
2184,2019-05-18T09:22:12.083800,Ashley,"That has to do with how you specify the stopping point for the range. Take a look at the range that's produced with and without the `+1` to see how it's impacted, and it should become a bit more clear"
2184,2019-05-18T15:50:33.086100,Hisako,`len(s)-len(find)+1` produces a number
2184,2019-05-18T15:52:01.086300,Hisako,"so
```
for x in range(0,len(s)-len(find)+1):
```
is similar to
```
end = len(s)-len(find)+1
for x in range(0,end):
```"

2190,2019-05-19T05:03:21.101500,Maryjo,"Hi everyone,

I am facing a problem and I would need some help on solving it.

I have the following data structure (a list of lists):

```
[
    [""BLUE"", ""XXL"", 98], 
    [""BLUE"", ""XL"", 97], 
    [""BLUE"", ""L"", 99], 
    [""BLUE"", ""M"", 103], 
    [""PINK"", ""XXL"", 104], 
    [""PINK"", ""XL"", 103], 
    [""PINK"", ""L"", 102], 
    [""PINK"", ""M"", 100],
    [""RED"", ""XXL"", 99], 
    [""RED"", ""XL"", 102], 
    [""RED"", ""L"", 109], 
    [""RED"", ""M"", 95],
]
```
Where the first element of the list is a color, the second element of the list is a size and the third element of the list is a number.

Is it possible to create a JSON format from this list like the following:

```
{
    ""BLUE"": {
                ""XXL"": 98,
                ""XL"": 97,
                ""L"": 99,
                ""M"": 103
            },
    ""PINK"": {
                ""XXL"": 104,
                ""XL"": 103,
                ""L"": 102,
                ""M"": 100
            },
    ""RED"": {
                ""XXL"": 99,
                ""XL"": 102,
                ""L"": 109,
                ""M"": 95
            }
}
```"
2190,2019-05-19T05:21:58.103200,Berenice,"If you are sure that the length of the inner `list` is going to be always 3 I would do something like this:
```
from collections import defaultdict


def json_from_arr(arr):

    for row in arr:
        [color, size, n] = row
        d[color][size] = n

    return dict(json)
```

then simply

```

    if len(rest) == 1:
        nested_dict[key] = rest[0]

2192,2019-05-19T09:49:58.114100,Ashley,<@Karen> use the Session class from the requests library. It's very easy to work with and manages the session cookies for you
2192,2019-05-19T10:23:56.120200,Karen,<@Ashley> can you give me some examples
2192,2019-05-19T10:28:17.120400,Ashley,<@Karen> they have a bunch in their docs
2192,2019-05-19T10:29:18.121500,Ashley,<@Christina> so there's links in these files that have the protocol on them and you're looking to find them all?
2192,2019-05-19T10:36:35.124200,Ashley,The easiest solution might be going for the syntax first
2192,2019-05-19T10:37:29.125400,Ashley,Then check the beginning of the URL for any protocol with `[a-zA-Z]+:\/\/`
2192,2019-05-19T10:37:45.125900,Ashley,Not sure if you have to escape the slashes though

2192,2019-05-19T10:42:44.127100,Christina,i was thinking something like that but i have to do a negative test really
2192,2019-05-19T10:44:29.127500,Christina,the only issue is if people write `[this is bad practice []()   ](<http://example.org|example.org>)`

2192,2019-05-19T12:01:45.131300,Ashley,<@Christina> is this to do validation on markdown or something? There might be a linter out there for it already that can take care of the other stuff
2192,2019-05-19T12:02:05.131800,Ashley,<@Karen> what do you mean my csrf magic?
2192,2019-05-19T12:07:11.132300,Karen,Can you take a look at the link above
2193,2019-05-19T09:58:59.119300,Christina,"So this is not Python but regex (and i know i just gave someone a ding :wink: )

I am trying to send some markdown files from one server to another. the markdown files have relative img paths. i want to prepend the domain of the first server to the domain, however i am not certain that all links follow this logic.

My thought was having a a regex that gets all links that doesn't start with `https?:` (so `http:` or `https:`) .. but not sure how i would easily search and replace as well. any ideas you lovely people?"
2193,2019-05-19T10:32:05.123500,Christina,"ish? i have both this occurrence `[example](<http://example.org>)` as well as `[foo](/test.pdf)`.

2194,2019-05-19T12:26:30.133500,Scot,will this work?

2194,2019-05-19T12:42:35.135000,Linnie,Does anyone know if there is some optimization is being done with `$` in regexes?
2194,2019-05-19T12:42:53.135400,Linnie,e.g. will it know it should actually match at the end of the string?
2194,2019-05-19T12:50:17.135900,Linnie,a small experiment shows that `$` is not optimized :disappointed:
2194,2019-05-19T13:17:03.137500,Linnie,"<@Jettie> like you can have a million 1's and then a 2, and try the regex `2$` and it will be slow"
2194,2019-05-19T13:17:39.138300,Linnie,I hoped it might somehow cleverly try fixed part of the regex together with an ending to short circuit
2194,2019-05-19T13:17:42.138500,Jettie,interesting
2194,2019-05-19T13:17:49.138800,Jettie,does `regex` handle it better?
2194,2019-05-19T13:18:56.139100,Linnie,nope
2194,2019-05-19T13:19:11.139400,Linnie,maybe a differen version on that right?
2194,2019-05-19T13:19:24.139700,Linnie,"I remember something like setting a protocol on it, i didn't yet"
2194,2019-05-19T13:20:05.139900,Linnie,no speed difference
2194,2019-05-19T13:20:23.140200,Jettie,maybe it's not something trivial to optimize
2194,2019-05-19T13:20:51.140500,Linnie,yea I think because it really is a left to right matcher
2194,2019-05-19T13:21:02.140900,Linnie,I just somehow thought that something clever might occur
2194,2019-05-19T13:21:54.141200,Linnie,btw my new package `textsearch` will come out very soon :smile: updating docs etc
2194,2019-05-19T13:22:48.141600,Jettie,:-)
2194,2019-05-19T13:23:05.142000,Linnie,afterwards I will update a lot of my packages (and add some new ones) based on it
2194,2019-05-19T13:24:26.142300,Linnie,I think it will be one of my most used ones haha
2194,2019-05-19T13:25:09.143000,Linnie,it will allow me to post the most convenient/tweakable and fastest tokenizer available in python :smile:
2195,2019-05-19T12:52:15.136300,Jettie,optimized how?
2196,2019-05-19T13:10:37.136500,Sasha,"So, the `''.join()` is a string operation. It won't work on other data types."
2196,2019-05-19T13:13:39.136700,Scot,so how to solve this question?
2196,2019-05-19T13:15:12.136900,Sasha,"I'll ask my original question again. If `x = 'hello'`, what expression would give you `'hellohello'`?"
2197,2019-05-19T13:56:45.143100,Christina,"It's for a university project with a micro-service inspired architecture, where each university group has a running service which can return a set of different things. one of them is markdown. It returns the markdown upon request from the server handling the UI. however the URL to the given microservice is not know at compile time, as everything is rather loosely coupled. BUT some groups didn't like having to use image hosting or CDNs. so they supply relative links, the microservice, which the browser does not know. so somewhere along the way (in angular) this domain has to be added."
2197,2019-05-19T13:56:54.143300,Scot,x+x
2197,2019-05-19T14:03:47.143700,Scot,yes thanks i solved it

2197,2019-05-19T14:05:26.144100,Scot,None
2198,2019-05-19T13:58:11.143500,Sasha,"Great. That also works for `4` -&gt; `8`. Does it also work for a list like `x = [""hi"", ""bye""]`?"
2199,2019-05-19T16:07:34.145400,Damien,"Does anyone know, within an executable created by PyInstaller, how would I spawn another Python process? `sys.executable` is my own packaged executable, so i can't use that."
2199,2019-05-19T16:27:16.146800,Damien,"I specifically need to trigger a python process, because i am trying to run another python script. Specifically via `python -m`"
2199,2019-05-19T16:27:36.147300,Damien,"subprocess only works if i have a path to a python executable, but i don't. multiprocess only works for passing code of my own to."
2199,2019-05-19T16:29:25.147800,Nigel,And requiring python to be in the PATH is not an option?
2199,2019-05-19T16:29:47.148300,Nigel,(in order to not rely on the sys.executable)
2199,2019-05-19T16:33:17.148400,Melia,"Good afternoon, could someone recommend a course to apply my basic knowledge of python and be able to climb a step more, I am between beginner and intermediate. I have done some python courses and I have gained in theory, I would like to continue learning but now I would like to do something more practical, some recommendations ??"
2199,2019-05-19T16:35:05.148500,Nigel,<@Melia> You can pick up something from here
2199,2019-05-19T16:43:44.149000,Damien,"<@Nigel> if Python was in the PATH, i wouldn't need to use PyInstaller."
2199,2019-05-19T16:50:44.149800,Nigel,"So the case would be: you want to call Python which is installed somewhere in the system from your frozen executable, right?"
2199,2019-05-19T16:54:10.150500,Nigel,"Oh, btw, I didn't ask. What is your target OS? Is it Windows?"
2199,2019-05-19T17:44:52.152300,Nigel,Then it means that you bundle the python together with executable. Which means that you should know where the bundled python is. How else could you expect to run `python -m`?
2199,2019-05-19T17:54:55.153400,Nigel,I was using pyinstaller several times in the past. Last time it was back in the beginning of 2016 though
2200,2019-05-19T16:23:48.146200,Nigel,Doesn't `multiprocessing` work? Or `subprocess`?
2201,2019-05-19T17:42:00.151400,Damien,"No, the whole point is its _not_ on the system. I think I'll need to look for some pyinstaller specific forum for the information i need."
2201,2019-05-19T17:47:32.152800,Damien,If you don't even know what PyInstaller is you don't have to try to answer a question you don't underestand.
2201,2019-05-19T20:06:59.155300,Bethany,only other option I can think of is using cython or similar to compile the python code to the target platform as well
2201,2019-05-19T20:21:29.155500,Damien,"Yes that is what it does, the first thing."
2202,2019-05-19T20:06:23.154900,Bethany,I was under the impression pyinstaller basically bundled a python interpreter plus your code for the intended target?
2203,2019-05-19T21:03:46.156200,Damien,anyway i found an alternative method for what i needed to do. I now have an single-file EXE that can pip install stuff lol
2203,2019-05-19T21:03:59.156500,Damien,i promise that might actually be useful even
2204,2019-05-19T22:47:34.159600,Erlene,"I'm following the channels documentation tutorial(<https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/part_2.html>), I've made sure that channels can communicate with redis but when I go to my webpage the websocket immediately closes and I get a connection refused error.

2204,2019-05-19T22:59:05.160200,Kassandra,does do you get any errors in the shell/logs were you are running django?

2204,2019-05-19T23:03:51.161400,Kassandra,sounds like django is having isseus talking to reddis (im assuming redis is running on 6379)
2204,2019-05-19T23:04:08.161600,Erlene,yes
2204,2019-05-19T23:04:29.162100,Erlene,I was able to follow the example on that page to make sure channels and redis are talking

2204,2019-05-19T23:05:41.163000,Kassandra,are you using the same django settings there as you are when you run django?
2204,2019-05-19T23:06:24.163400,Erlene,what do you mean? I should be
2204,2019-05-19T23:07:32.164100,Kassandra,"probably, i assuming your not running django within docker or something?"
2204,2019-05-19T23:07:53.164800,Kassandra,just running something like `python3 manage.py runserver` ?
2204,2019-05-19T23:08:02.165000,Erlene,I am but it just copies the local configuration I believe
2204,2019-05-19T23:08:24.165800,Erlene,I can paste my docker-compose.yml and requirements.txt
2204,2019-05-19T23:08:37.166100,Kassandra,that could be your issue `6379` withing docker != to `6397` on your machines localhost
2204,2019-05-19T23:09:25.167200,Kassandra,yer one way to check this is to exec into your docek container an run the above test within the container
2204,2019-05-19T23:09:46.167700,Kassandra,if that also fails with the same error then it is most likly something to do with compose not being configured properly
2204,2019-05-19T23:21:20.168900,Erlene,And here is my docker-compose.yml. Is there anything here that looks out of place or do I need to add anything? The redis and django servers starts up when I run docker compose.
2204,2019-05-19T23:32:54.170600,Kassandra,"on your `web` you need to add a secont that binds it through to the `redis`

add a
```
links:
     - ""redis:redis""
```

to the web secion

and then in your settings.py instread of `localhost:6397` have `redis:6397`"
2204,2019-05-19T23:33:30.171700,Kassandra,what the above does is make the domain name `redis` in your `web` docker container = to your redis docker container
2204,2019-05-19T23:39:25.172100,Erlene,where do i put the redis:6397 in my settings.py?
2204,2019-05-19T23:40:02.172500,Erlene,do I also need to set it to redis in the channel layers portion?
2204,2019-05-20T00:38:35.173300,Kassandra,yes that is were you need to set it in the layers settings
2204,2019-05-20T00:38:53.173800,Kassandra,(i was assuming that was in your settings.py but of cource it does not need to be)
2204,2019-05-20T00:40:29.174500,Erlene,I ended up not using docker and it works when just using the django server. Thank you for the help

2208,2019-05-20T09:53:19.194300,Clemmie,"does the api you are using have an option for taking a list of ids? If not, you might want to explain what you are trying to do with all the requests, and we can see if there is another way of doing things."
2208,2019-05-20T09:55:57.197000,Leanora,"No, it doesn't take list of ids. That api returns me a json. All I need was, clean that json(removing some keys by checking the values of the key). Whole purpose of this code is, get all the list of eligible candidates based on the id and his other details. Also, response_json is list of dict type."
2208,2019-05-20T09:58:19.199400,Clemmie,"Sorry, I meant what you are trying to do as a whole, where this is a part of.This code is correct, but slow, as you said. There are not a whole lot of ways to make it faster (you could investigate making the calls asynchronously, possibly). I was thinking that perhaps we could rethink your problem so that you don’t need to make all these api calls, or at least not have to make them all at once"
2208,2019-05-20T10:01:30.199800,Hiroko,or investigate whether the api used has batch capability
2208,2019-05-20T10:01:44.200100,Hiroko,"however, that’s not often a common feature"
2208,2019-05-20T10:02:21.200900,Leanora,I did investigated and api doesn't have batch capability. May be I need to try making the api calls asynchronously.
2208,2019-05-20T10:04:02.202400,Clemmie,"Can you tell us what you are using the result of this code snippet in? It sounds like a job placement tool. Could you present a single candidate at a time, so as to not have to make all the api calls at once?"
2208,2019-05-20T10:04:42.202800,Clemmie,"or paginate so you never have to fetch more than , say, 10 candidates?"
2208,2019-05-20T10:10:30.203600,Leanora,"No, I can't paginate it. Thats a third party api. Hence, I'm limited to make only one candidate id at a time."
2208,2019-05-20T10:10:49.204200,Clemmie,I meant on your display end
2208,2019-05-20T10:11:29.205300,Clemmie,"if you are stuck using a third party implementation that is too slow for how you wanted to do things, then you need to rethink how you do things"
2208,2019-05-20T10:11:49.206200,Leanora,I mean its a part of big dashboard. This is a small module and we need to get all the candidates.
2208,2019-05-20T10:12:34.207800,Carlee,<@Leanora> can you try parallelizing the requests? There is no need for them to execute sequentially
2208,2019-05-20T10:12:38.208100,Clemmie,can you make the dashboard make ajax calls so as to load the details async that way?
2208,2019-05-20T10:13:09.208700,Clemmie,"you can do async on the python end, but it will be a bit harder to collect all the data correctly"
2208,2019-05-20T10:13:45.209400,Leanora,"I can do that. But, I'm just being cautions about how to collect all data correctly."
2208,2019-05-20T10:14:18.210800,Clemmie,"If each candidates data is self contained, and you don’t need to aggregate anything, I would do it with ajax calls"
2208,2019-05-20T10:14:39.211300,Leanora,Can you point me some examples for how to do it.
2208,2019-05-20T10:14:43.211500,Clemmie,ajax?
2208,2019-05-20T10:14:59.212000,Leanora,its an api. Not sure how ajax works here
2208,2019-05-20T10:15:07.212400,Leanora,And all the code base is in python
2208,2019-05-20T10:15:16.212900,Clemmie,ohhhh.
2208,2019-05-20T10:15:18.213100,Leanora,"Sorry, I have very little knowledge on ajax"
2208,2019-05-20T10:15:23.213300,Clemmie,I figured your dashboard was a webapp

2210,2019-05-20T11:33:06.216800,Johna,i feel bad for the team that decided to do that as asyncio was documented to be added just two months after this article
2210,2019-05-20T11:36:14.217200,Johna,wait i’m confused… reading now and they’re citing asyncio /shrug
2210,2019-05-20T11:39:59.217600,Johna,what is aiohttp? if not asyncio
2210,2019-05-20T11:42:26.217900,Hiroko,its a web server/client based on asyncio

2211,2019-05-20T12:00:59.220200,Arturo,this virtual machine has its own ip
2211,2019-05-20T12:02:25.220700,Claudine,"seems about right, if your VM can access your network I'd think you're set up nicely"
2211,2019-05-20T12:06:34.222400,Arturo,"ok so my thought process is, create a shared folder, once the process running on the vm has finished it generates a file and saves it in the shared folder, then the other person can see it and use that file"
2211,2019-05-20T12:21:13.223700,Arturo,"managed to do it, but what is interesting is that I cannot share just one folder on the using the Microsoft vm, on VM ware I have done this before, but this only lets me share the c drive"
2212,2019-05-20T13:58:00.225200,Jorge,"This code returns either a matching element ( where `dog['name'] == 'Dr. Pupper'`) or an empty dict.

Is there a simple way to transform this so that it returns either single element or *None*?"
2212,2019-05-20T13:59:30.225900,Clemmie,replace `else {}` with `else None`
2212,2019-05-20T13:59:47.226200,Jorge,that gives me an ~NoneType~ Attribute error
2212,2019-05-20T14:01:21.227400,Sasha,I think you can tag an `or None` on to the end of the expression to transform the empty dict case.
2212,2019-05-20T14:02:02.227900,Jorge,"ah, cool"
2212,2019-05-20T14:02:08.228100,Jorge,"that works, thanks"
2212,2019-05-20T14:04:12.229500,Sasha,"You might double-check if the `reduce()` works correctly if `'Dr. Pupper'` is the final element in the list. Since you're not using `y`, I'm a little suspicious that it will skip that case."
2212,2019-05-20T14:05:44.229800,Jorge,"oh, that doesnt work"
2212,2019-05-20T14:06:14.230400,Sasha,Actually it might not work for anything but the first element.
2212,2019-05-20T14:07:00.230900,Jorge,"yea, i think thats the case. and if i switch to using y, i'll miss out on if it is the first element"
2212,2019-05-20T14:08:15.231200,Sasha,Can you use `filter()` instead?
2212,2019-05-20T14:09:30.232400,Jorge,i guess. my impression is that you want to use `filter` when you are going from *list* -&gt; *smaller list* and `reduce` when you are going from *list* -&gt; *any*
2212,2019-05-20T14:12:30.233800,Sasha,"I tend to conceptualize it as using `filter()` when you're looking at properties of a single item, `map()` when you're operating on single items, and `reduce()` when you are operating on pairs of items."
2212,2019-05-20T14:14:40.234400,Sasha,"Hahaha, how about `max(dogs, key=lambda x: x['name'] == 'Dr. Pupper')`?"
2212,2019-05-20T14:16:39.235100,Jettie,just never use reduce :)
2212,2019-05-20T14:16:56.235500,Jettie,then you only have map and filter to worry about
2212,2019-05-20T14:17:03.235800,Jettie,everybody wins
2212,2019-05-20T14:19:01.237800,Jorge,"lol the max function works.
as for filter, it just looks kind of ugly having to do something like:
```
my_filter = filter(lambda x: x['name'] == 'Dr. Pupper', dogs)
dog = list(my_filter)[0]
```
or actually, more like:
```
my_filter = filter(lambda x: x['name'] == 'Dr. Pupper', dogs)
if len(list(my_filter)):
    dog = list(my_filter)[0]
else:
    dog = None
```"
2212,2019-05-20T14:20:04.238700,Sasha,"Actually, the `max()` option won't work in the negative case, since it'll return another item."
2212,2019-05-20T14:23:35.239900,Sasha,This may work: `max(x if x.get('name') == 'Dr. Pupper' else None for x in dogs)`
2212,2019-05-20T14:25:32.240600,Brain,what if there are more than 1 matching element?
2212,2019-05-20T14:26:22.241200,Sasha,It'll just pick one semi-arbitrarily... I think dicts are compared by memory address or something.
2212,2019-05-20T14:28:04.242700,Jorge,"for more than one element, that probably means I have a data error, and i'll probably want to throw an exception.
Maybe trying to make this into a one liner is a bit of a stretch"
2212,2019-05-20T14:36:57.246300,Jorge,I went with something similar to this
2212,2019-05-20T14:42:42.248600,Jorge,"thanks for the help <@Sasha> <@Brain> :taco:

honorable mention: <@Jettie>, <@Clemmie> and <@Holly>"
2213,2019-05-20T14:31:21.245500,Brain,"if it should not return every matching element, than personally I’d rather go with simple loop to be able to `break` when there is a match instead of continue looking.
Also from my experience python one-liners (or any language one-liners) are cool, but many beginners have difficulties understanding them."
2213,2019-05-20T14:32:25.246200,Holly,I've been using python for a good while and one liners are still difficult for me to understand lol
2213,2019-05-20T14:40:13.247000,Sasha,Crystal clear.  :+1:

2214,2019-05-20T15:09:18.250700,Raguel,how do you guys version APIs? I see arguments for and against putting it in URI
2214,2019-05-20T15:13:20.251300,Jettie,where else could you put it? :o
2214,2019-05-20T15:15:47.251500,Karoline,as a header
2214,2019-05-20T15:16:06.252000,Raguel,"yeah, header vs uri"
2214,2019-05-20T15:16:33.252500,Karoline,I like URI personally
2214,2019-05-20T15:16:44.252800,Karoline,I can see why some people don't though
2214,2019-05-20T15:17:00.253100,Clemmie,I like uri also - easier to test/prototype against
2214,2019-05-20T15:22:52.253800,Jettie,it's also easier to manage
2214,2019-05-20T15:23:05.254100,Jettie,you could have v1 and v2 point to different app servers
2214,2019-05-20T15:23:26.254600,Jettie,or introduce a delay to /v1/ if you want users to migrate to v2 faster
2214,2019-05-20T15:23:52.254900,Rikki,how it is easier to manage?
2214,2019-05-20T15:23:56.255100,Rikki,what do you mean by that
2214,2019-05-20T15:24:08.255500,Rikki,then difference is semantical only there is no management troubles
2214,2019-05-20T15:24:26.255800,Rikki,header vs uri is preference only
2214,2019-05-20T15:26:03.256700,Hiroko,"for testing purposes and sheer ease of use, use URI"
2214,2019-05-20T15:26:09.257000,Hiroko,"if you want to get fancy, use header"
2214,2019-05-20T15:26:45.257900,Hiroko,"but to be honest, if an API made me use versions in header for unauthed endpoints, I’d be annoyed"
2214,2019-05-20T15:27:41.259000,Rikki,"I dont see difference seriously, I would even say headers make sense"
2214,2019-05-20T15:27:45.259400,Clemmie,"If you are pedantic about what REST means, use headers (as with URI you would end up with multiple endpoints for the same(?) resource)'"
2214,2019-05-20T15:27:51.259600,Rikki,especially when you use accept-version header
2214,2019-05-20T15:27:58.259900,Rikki,or accept content type
2214,2019-05-20T15:28:28.260600,Clemmie,<@Rikki> how do I quick-explore an api in a browser with headers?
2214,2019-05-20T15:28:43.261300,Clemmie,"I think headers can be fine, but your documentation needs to be that much better"
2214,2019-05-20T15:28:58.261700,Rikki,why would you think exploring api in browser is something you should do?
2214,2019-05-20T15:29:00.261800,Jettie,"different locations in nginx and that's it

with headers it's a bit more cumbersome"
2214,2019-05-20T15:29:26.262300,Rikki,"btw you should explore documentation, rather api itself"
2214,2019-05-20T15:29:40.262500,Hiroko,swagger/yasg?
2214,2019-05-20T15:30:19.263500,Clemmie,"you should, yes. I am doing AWS stuff right now. If the only option for AWS was the documentation then no one would be able to use the bulk of AWS services"
2214,2019-05-20T15:30:46.263900,Clemmie,And they have the resources to make good documentation. they just….don’t

2214,2019-05-20T15:32:49.265100,Claudine,or they do one very specific estoeric example for their code and that's it

2215,2019-05-20T16:12:52.276700,Raguel,I wanna know more about it!
2215,2019-05-20T16:20:44.276900,Claudine,"well so im required to support Basic Auth, so I do it with an API Gateway Authorizer function and the following setup:
  - Multiple groups, each group has an inline policy allowing a specific HTTP method on the specific API Gateway endpoints a user in the group can access
  - A User is created, assigned to a group, and an access key is generated for the user
  - To authenticate, the user provides their Username and Password (access key) when making a request
  - The lambda function parses the credentials from the request, pulls up the user and verifies the access key.
 - If the user is authenticated, their group is pulled up, the groups inline policy is parsed into a set of `Method: endpoint`s
 - an access policy is generated on the fly based off that set and returned by the authorizer function"
2215,2019-05-20T16:21:24.277100,Claudine,"So If I want to adjust permissions, I just edit the group's inline policy. If i want to give a new user access with a given set of permission, i just create a new user, assign to a group, and them give them their username/access_key"
2215,2019-05-20T16:21:48.277300,Claudine,since they don't have the secret key they really can't do anything they haven't been given explicit permission to do
2215,2019-05-20T16:22:54.277500,Claudine,"I also needed to version all of this, so I've defined all the user/group/policy stuff in a `serverless` yml file"
2215,2019-05-20T16:39:15.277700,Raguel,sweet -- I need to learn how to do this directly in API gateway. Currently I am using APIGEE which allows us to do most of it.
2215,2019-05-20T16:40:32.277900,Raguel,"You create one API, and then create different products out of it with access to different endpoints"
2215,2019-05-20T16:43:06.278100,Raguel,"it was just Apigee makes it easier, but I want to try everything on API gateway so that there is not other layer"
2215,2019-05-20T16:56:10.278500,Claudine,"It wasn't too bad for me, I just read API Gateway Authorizer docs, it essentially hooks up a lambda to handle everything, and then you can do whatever you want in that lambda"
2215,2019-05-20T16:56:22.278700,Claudine,So setting it up is easily just the implementation is tough

2217,2019-05-20T17:06:56.279900,Jorge,"depends on the project, but usually checkout their repo + issues, and see if there's a beginner friendly issue to work on.
you'll probably have to be familiar with git"

2220,2019-05-21T02:15:40.288400,Lindsey,hmm. trying an ordered dict now
2221,2019-05-21T10:35:21.299200,Dawn,"If you have an API which is called by web/native apps (so users visiting your site/app) but also by some applications on your side and you want to see which calls are done by whom, while there is no authentication, is there some way to identify like a 'unique device' or whatever that's calling your api?

Not interested in knowing who's doing what exactly, but I would like to know how many unique apps or people are calling the API instead of knowing all the separate API calls without any context. And since users are not logged in there's no way to tell if 1 guy is calling the API 1000 times or 1000 users are calling it once"
2221,2019-05-21T10:37:07.300400,Hiroko,"without any kind of identifier coming from the client, no"
2221,2019-05-21T10:37:25.301000,Hiroko,you can look at user agent strings for identifying the clients being used
2221,2019-05-21T10:38:11.301800,Hiroko,"but as far as unique identifiers, if you’re not requiring that being part of the API call, how would such a method work?"
2221,2019-05-21T10:38:30.302100,Dawn,"I have no idea, that's why I was asking :upside_down_face:"
2221,2019-05-21T10:38:59.303100,Dawn,Was wondering if there's some kind of device identifier or whatever that's always being sent
2221,2019-05-21T10:39:06.303500,Eliana,lol. yea you would have to try and use existing information which isn’t perfect but you could extrapolate quite a bit. you also have to ask if you want that kind of overhead.
2221,2019-05-21T10:39:08.303700,Dawn,Don't have a lot of experience in this field
2221,2019-05-21T10:39:26.304100,Eliana,the user agent string as <@Hiroko> suggested but it can easily be spoofed.
2221,2019-05-21T10:40:05.304900,Eliana,you could create some kind of compound key such as user agent string and ip address.
2221,2019-05-21T10:40:26.305600,Dawn,But are user agent string and IP address always sent with the request in the headers?
2221,2019-05-21T10:40:29.305700,Carlo,even IP address is not perfectly reliable
2221,2019-05-21T10:40:49.306800,Eliana,yep that’s why i said it isn’t going to be perfect.
2221,2019-05-21T10:40:58.307100,Dawn,Nah I didn't expect 100% reliability but something that's getting close to some form of grouping that would be nice
2221,2019-05-21T10:40:58.307200,Carlo,honestly anything that's received by the client should be seen as unreliable
2221,2019-05-21T10:41:06.307500,Carlo,depends on how reliable you need this to be
2221,2019-05-21T10:41:51.308800,Carlo,but yeah if you're okay with some fuziness then id go with something hand-rolled li a IP/UA compound as <@Eliana> said
2221,2019-05-21T10:41:56.309000,Eliana,i think it’s ok to assume what normal users would do. they probably won’t be changing their user client or ip address. if you are more worried about crackers or script kiddies then it’s going to be REALLY tough.
2221,2019-05-21T10:42:33.309700,Carlo,IP is unreliable with VPN users too
2221,2019-05-21T10:43:01.310600,Eliana,"what you should do is force some kind of auth (token, basic login, etc)"
2221,2019-05-21T10:43:10.310900,Carlo,also a bunch of ISPs have dynamic IPs
2221,2019-05-21T10:43:13.311100,Eliana,and limit requests if it’s open.
2221,2019-05-21T10:43:23.311400,Eliana,like github
2221,2019-05-21T10:44:04.311900,Dawn,"yeah but still, dynamic IP doesn't change every day"
2221,2019-05-21T10:44:17.312300,Dawn,"so at least some form of grouping, for regular users, is fine for our use case"
2221,2019-05-21T10:44:35.312800,Dawn,thanks for the tips. Are user agent and IP always sent in the headers?
2221,2019-05-21T10:46:05.313600,Carlo,"with regular browsers, without VPN, usually they are"
2221,2019-05-21T10:46:37.314500,Carlo,"(btw not just ISPs, mobile IPs change a lot)"
2221,2019-05-21T10:46:44.314900,Karoline,my ip changes every day
2221,2019-05-21T10:46:47.315100,Eliana,users will eventually do really bad things. make sure to have plenty of testing.
2221,2019-05-21T10:46:54.315300,Dawn,But we also have native apps talking to our APIs (Android/iOS). Those probably don't have user agent :thinking_face:
2221,2019-05-21T10:47:30.316100,Jimmy,"it depends of your ISP, I think in the EU it's around 24 to 72h"
2221,2019-05-21T10:51:21.316500,Hiroko,<@Dawn> they will have use agent strings
2221,2019-05-21T10:52:03.317400,Hiroko,"we have android/ios apps for work product, and new relic/datadog both allow us to monitor by user agent with mobile apps"

2231,2019-05-21T21:11:47.379200,Vern,"Hello, I am looking for some direction I am trying to figure out how to apply a bias to a random.  Selecting random number between 1 and 1000 a large number of times will average to 500 with even distribution.  What I want to be able to do is apply a bias such that all numbers are still selected but with a bias to select a low or a high number more often (resulting in lower or higher average), or a middle bias, such that the average is still 500 but numbers closer to 500 are selected with a higher frequency then numbers Further away"
2231,2019-05-21T21:27:43.381900,Sasha,"There's lots of ways to potentially do that, depending on the degree of bias you want. For the low/high case, you could generate a random number between 1 and 1500, and take the range between 1001-1500 to be a duplicate of the 1-500 or 501-1000 range, giving you an extra chance of landing there. For a middle bias, you could generate two numbers 1-500 and sum them, which would tend to cluster towards the center like a pair of dice are more likely to roll 7."
2231,2019-05-21T21:30:06.382700,Sasha,"In the most general case, you could figure out exactly the probability distribution you want, and then convert a uniform random number into that distribution with a mapping function."

2233,2019-05-22T01:24:06.398500,Deangelo,oh that's awesome.
2233,2019-05-22T01:24:42.399100,Deangelo,didn't know range has a third argument
2233,2019-05-22T01:25:53.399500,Sasha,"Yeah, very handy. You can set the step negative to count downwards, too."
2233,2019-05-22T01:30:46.404000,Deangelo,"that's cool! one more challenge, let's say my monthly data starts in nov 2019, so the first 2 values nov and dec are aggregated for 2019, then the next 12 months are for 2020, etc.
So the resulting yearly aggregate would look like [sum(m1,m2), sum(m3,m14), sum(m15,m27)...]
Any tips? I was thinking one approach is to remove m1 and m2 from the monthly list to sum separately before running the rest through the regular aggregator"
2233,2019-05-22T01:35:10.405500,Sasha,"You could set `offset = -10`, and then do `[sum(monthly[max(i, 0):i+12]) for i in range(offset, len(monthly), 12)]`."

2233,2019-05-22T01:36:39.406500,Nanci,I'd still accept some help :disappointed:
2233,2019-05-22T01:37:08.407300,Deangelo,I'll experiment with this. Thanks <@Sasha>
2233,2019-05-22T01:38:02.408300,Sasha,"And don't feel the need to do it as a one-liner. A regular loop with `append()`, etc. is perfectly fine."
2233,2019-05-22T01:38:35.408800,Deangelo,list comprehension is typically faster no?
2233,2019-05-22T01:38:51.408900,Conchita,Where is the question?
2233,2019-05-22T01:40:03.409800,Sasha,"Yes, but if you care about speed, work in C++.  :wink:  Making the code friendly to its maintainers counts for a lot."
2233,2019-05-22T01:40:11.409900,Nanci,I sent it on the messages before that
2233,2019-05-22T01:42:38.412400,Deangelo,"strong point, but we do need speed. Hundreds of this aggregate function will run to render a single report, and we found these list comprehension to bring down processing time from 18s to 3s. specifically when they are nested in other loops"
2233,2019-05-22T01:44:04.413200,Deangelo,otherwise readability is very important
2233,2019-05-22T01:46:42.414900,Sasha,"Fair enough. I don't see any obvious speed optimization beyond what's given above, though you might also consider `numpy` if you need to churn through a lot of calculations fast."
2233,2019-05-22T01:49:18.419000,Deangelo,"I considered numpy but it's a heavy dependency. so far I'm enjoying the fast deployment ci builds. numpy also works for many things but you may or may not find what you need, like this special aggregation, not sure you get similar functionality there. I know Pandas has Grouper which does something similar"
2234,2019-05-22T02:06:21.420400,Leida,"i dont understand the square brackets here ```def create_multipliers():

2234,2019-05-22T02:07:15.421800,Leida,its an example of latebinding closures gone wrong but i cant wrap my brain around it
2234,2019-05-22T02:07:26.422200,Leida,"```for multiplier in create_multipliers():
    print(multiplier(2))```"
2234,2019-05-22T02:07:53.422800,Sasha,It's returning a list of lambda functions.
2234,2019-05-22T02:08:15.423300,Leida,so what happens when `multiplier(2)` gets called?
2234,2019-05-22T02:08:39.424000,Leida,also wouldnt the list be single element?
2234,2019-05-22T02:08:39.424100,Sasha,"It executes the lambda, returning a multiple of `2`."
2234,2019-05-22T02:09:12.424400,Sasha,"The list should be 5 elements, from `range(5)`."
2234,2019-05-22T02:10:17.425600,Leida,but multiplier would be a list of lambdas so how would a lambda get called there?
2234,2019-05-22T02:10:46.426500,Leida,isnt the array single element with lambda in side where the range is inside the lamda?
2234,2019-05-22T02:10:50.426600,Sasha,"`create_multipliers()` returns a list, and `for multiplier` iterates over each element."
2234,2019-05-22T02:11:00.426800,Leida,ah right my bad
2234,2019-05-22T02:11:24.427400,Leida,"and the output is ```8
8
8
8

2234,2019-05-22T02:11:54.427800,Sasha,That seems wrong. Hang on.
2234,2019-05-22T02:14:28.428700,Leida,:smile: im reading about python cotchas - this result is an example of latebinding closures
2234,2019-05-22T02:14:53.429200,Leida,i made an error in reading it so it i couldnt figure out how this gotcha works
2234,2019-05-22T02:15:38.429400,Leida,"```Five functions are created; instead all of them just multiply x by 4.

Python’s closures are late binding. This means that the values of variables used in closures are looked up at the time the inner function is called.

Here, whenever any of the returned functions are called, the value of i is looked up in the surrounding scope at call time. By then, the loop has completed and i is left with its final value of 4.```"
2234,2019-05-22T02:18:03.430400,Sasha,Yikes. I would have failed that interview question. I'm still not sure what scope `i` still exists in at call time.
2234,2019-05-22T02:18:29.430900,Leida,if you replace the list with a generator it works tho
2234,2019-05-22T02:20:03.431500,Leida,ok i think i got it now
2234,2019-05-22T02:20:24.432000,Leida,python has some cotchas but seems to have alot less of em than say javascript
2234,2019-05-22T02:22:22.433000,Leida,the article im reading gives some workarounds but it it fails to use generators which makes it so that the range isnt iterated over before the for loop and everything is fine
2234,2019-05-22T02:22:42.433400,Leida,"```using a default arg like so:

def create_multipliers():
    return [lambda x, i=i : i * x for i in range(5)]
Alternatively, you can use the functools.partial function:

from functools import partial
from operator import mul

def create_multipliers():
    return [partial(mul, i) for i in range(5)]```"
2234,2019-05-22T02:23:16.433800,Leida,the default arg route makes the whole thing even messier xD
2234,2019-05-22T02:23:25.434200,Leida,give that line as an interview question :smiling_imp:
2234,2019-05-22T02:23:27.434300,Chester,I think python gotchas can be counted on the fingers of one hand
2234,2019-05-22T02:27:21.434900,Leida,often things arent even gotchas and are so by design
2234,2019-05-22T02:27:36.435300,Leida,you can do clever stuff with advanced features
2234,2019-05-22T02:27:50.435700,Leida,js seems to have gotchas as a result of naive design

2235,2019-05-22T03:36:04.441300,Conchita,Even more so after starting to play with nodejs
2235,2019-05-22T03:36:58.442500,Conchita,"One of the guys in our team fell ill, so they wanted me to have a look at one of the less critical issues"
2235,2019-05-22T03:37:36.442800,Deangelo,"ah ok, what's your question?"
2235,2019-05-22T03:38:51.443000,Conchita,"Thanks. How do I pass the `message` property as an argument into `myFunction`?

```
        .catch(err =&gt; {
          logger.error({
            loanId: id,
            message: `Error encountered when syncing with status: ${err.status}`,
            payload: err.statusMessage,
            body: err.body
          })
          myFunction(message, callback, destination)```"
2235,2019-05-22T03:40:17.443200,Conchita,"FYI to test the code I'm working on, it needs to pass two people and often takes up to 3 days. I'm to fresh into JS to be able to write a similar function to test this"
2235,2019-05-22T03:40:41.443400,Conchita,So maybe I already got it or I'm missing something trivial. Great if you have some input
2235,2019-05-22T03:40:48.443600,Deangelo,"no worries, this is easy, one sec"
2235,2019-05-22T03:41:04.443800,Conchita,:pray:
2235,2019-05-22T03:42:08.444100,Deangelo,"```
somePromise
  .catch(err =&gt; {
    const message = `Error encountered when syncing with status: ${err.status}`
    logger.error({
      loanId: id,
      message,
      payload: err.statusMessage,
      body: err.body
    })
    myFunction(message, callback, destination)
  })
```"
2235,2019-05-22T03:43:28.444400,Deangelo,so you extract the message into its own constant so you can use it in 2 different places. the logger and the custom function
2235,2019-05-22T03:43:51.444600,Conchita,"Awesome - can you please explain `message,`? What happens on that line?"
2235,2019-05-22T03:45:20.444800,Deangelo,"sure, it's declaring a constant variable named `message`. its value is a string literal. string literals allow you to inject dynamic values in them."
2235,2019-05-22T03:45:55.445000,Deangelo,"as a result, the string literal ```
Error encountered when syncing with status: ${err.status}```"
2235,2019-05-22T03:46:04.445300,Conchita,"Ok great, was just about to ask if the constant could still access the variable ""err.status"", but you just answered it too"
2235,2019-05-22T03:46:32.445600,Conchita,Thank you so much!
2235,2019-05-22T03:46:48.445800,Deangelo,"becomes:
```
Error encountered when syncing with status: 500
```
when err.status has the value 500 for example"
2235,2019-05-22T03:47:03.446000,Deangelo,yep
2235,2019-05-22T03:47:53.446300,Conchita,"One bonus question - for this function. My function takes in a callback as an argument. The issue is that, not all blocks of code where I need to call this function ahve a callback defined."
2235,2019-05-22T03:48:25.446500,Conchita,Should I then modify my code to hav ethe callback as an optional argument or is there better solution for this?
2235,2019-05-22T03:48:33.446700,Conchita,An example is the snippet you just helped me with
2235,2019-05-22T03:48:50.446900,Conchita,"It has no defined callback, but other code blocks do where it is required"
2235,2019-05-22T03:50:00.447100,Deangelo,"ok, you can definitely make the callback optional"
2235,2019-05-22T03:50:19.447600,Deangelo,by checking if it's passed of not
2235,2019-05-22T03:51:23.449000,Deangelo,"```
function myFunction(message, cb) {
  ... do stuff
  if (cb) {
    cb(someValue)
  }

2235,2019-05-22T03:52:43.450000,Deangelo,it's also a common pattern to have a method that returns both a promise and supports callbacks so you can use it both ways.

2240,2019-05-22T07:01:35.472000,Leida,if you have python installed then running `python filename.py` does the trick
2240,2019-05-22T07:01:56.472600,Leida,if you are looking for something that runs the file from sublime then there might be some addon for that
2240,2019-05-22T07:02:14.473200,Amparo,Where I should run. Generally in coldfusion I run the test file like localhost:8500/test.cfm
2240,2019-05-22T07:02:58.473900,Amparo,Okay I tried with open the particular file in IDLE.
2240,2019-05-22T07:03:05.474300,Leida,ah so you wish to run it through testserver web api?
2240,2019-05-22T07:03:10.474500,Amparo,And I can ran it by press f5
2240,2019-05-22T07:03:24.475000,Amparo,It;s will display the result
2240,2019-05-22T07:03:36.475600,Leida,if you open command line in the folder that the file is in you can run the command i mentioned
2240,2019-05-22T07:03:53.476100,Leida,<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8551735/how-do-i-run-python-code-from-sublime-text-2>
2240,2019-05-22T07:04:09.476800,Amparo,"Again I changed something in my sublime , And Do I need to reopen that file in IDLE and run again ? is this only option ?"
2240,2019-05-22T07:04:14.477000,Leida,with this you can run it in the editor which does a similar thing in the background
2240,2019-05-22T07:04:35.477300,Leida,you dont need to open it in IDLE
2240,2019-05-22T07:04:59.478100,Leida,python isnt a compiled language so you dont need to run anything extra before running the script
2240,2019-05-22T07:06:12.478400,Amparo,None
2240,2019-05-22T07:09:06.480000,Leida,you dont seem to have python in your path. Have you installed python?
2240,2019-05-22T07:09:40.480600,Amparo,"My question is, If I open test.py file in both sublime &amp; IDLE. Then if once I change something in sublime that will not reflect in IDLE"
2240,2019-05-22T07:09:59.480900,Amparo,Yes. I can successfully run it via IDLE
2240,2019-05-22T07:11:16.481900,Leida,um you would need to reload the file in IDLE for the updates to show. I dont know if IDLE has some setting to keep track of file changes or not. In general if you use sublime then you dont need to use IDLE
2240,2019-05-22T07:11:34.482400,Leida,IDLE is a small editor that comes with the python installation
2240,2019-05-22T07:11:58.483300,Amparo,Yes. So could you please help to run the py file via sublime
2240,2019-05-22T07:12:00.483500,Leida,open up command prompt (windows key + r) and type in cmd
2240,2019-05-22T07:12:29.484400,Leida,this will open up command prompt for you
2240,2019-05-22T07:12:33.484700,Amparo,Each and every time I type the code in sublime and open the file in IDLE and press f5.. That was I'm doing each and every changes
2240,2019-05-22T07:12:50.485100,Leida,then type in `python` and tell me what it says
2240,2019-05-22T07:13:13.485400,Amparo,Internal &amp; external command issue
2240,2019-05-22T07:13:53.485700,Amparo,"python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file."
2240,2019-05-22T07:14:34.486500,Leida,ok that means python is not in your path. That basically means that if you type python the executable is not found. This is what sublime does to find python.
2240,2019-05-22T07:14:50.486800,Leida,you can follow this to add python to your path <https://geek-university.com/python/add-python-to-the-windows-path/>
2240,2019-05-22T07:15:23.487500,Leida,then do the sublime settings thing and then you can run python by pressing crtl+b
2240,2019-05-22T07:16:24.488600,Leida,"windows installation for python has a section where you can choose features, adding to path is one of them and by default it is off. Most any program that needs to use python will want python to be on path so you generally need to set it to install it."
2240,2019-05-22T07:16:55.489200,Leida,"If the guide is too complex you can try running python installer again, there you can add that feature"
2240,2019-05-22T07:28:14.489700,Amparo,<@Leida>
2240,2019-05-22T07:28:39.490500,Amparo,I can see a version while go in to C &gt;&gt; Python34 &gt;&gt; python --version
2240,2019-05-22T07:28:56.491200,Leida,that is because python is installed in the Python34 folder
2240,2019-05-22T07:28:59.491400,Amparo,I can't see the version while C&gt;&gt;User&gt;&gt;userName &gt;&gt; python -- version
2240,2019-05-22T07:29:12.492000,Amparo,DO I need to create a environment variable now ?
2240,2019-05-22T07:29:21.492300,Leida,but you want to be able to access python from any folder
2240,2019-05-22T07:29:36.492600,Leida,"yes, you still dont have python in your path"
2240,2019-05-22T07:30:10.493200,Amparo,Okay. Then How I can install by default ? I mean inside program file instead of python34.
2240,2019-05-22T07:30:21.493400,Amparo,Is this possible ?
2240,2019-05-22T07:32:01.493700,Amparo,Got it Karl Uibo
2240,2019-05-22T07:33:40.494600,Leida,the easiest solution would be to re-run the installer and add the option to add python to path - that should fix your woes.
2240,2019-05-22T07:36:13.495300,Amparo,"So you mean instead of install python in c:python34, We should install it in c:programfiles:python34 ?"
2240,2019-05-22T07:36:31.495700,Amparo,So that we no need to create environment variable / mapping etc..
2240,2019-05-22T07:36:36.495900,Amparo,Right ?
2240,2019-05-22T07:38:03.496100,Hiroko,no
2240,2019-05-22T07:38:24.496900,Amparo,So How I can debug my code here ?
2240,2019-05-22T07:38:26.497000,Hiroko,we mean uninstall and reinstall with the pythin installer and check the option to add to path
2240,2019-05-22T07:38:54.497600,Amparo,Yes. I choose by default path that is c:python43.
2240,2019-05-22T07:39:07.498100,Hiroko,"NO, not that path"
2240,2019-05-22T07:39:10.498300,Hiroko,system path
2240,2019-05-22T07:39:16.498500,Amparo,Okay
2240,2019-05-22T07:39:27.499000,Hiroko,<https://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/tasks/fot-addpath.html>
2240,2019-05-22T07:39:36.499300,Amparo,Now How I can debug my code. Is there any function for that.
2240,2019-05-22T07:39:47.499600,Hiroko,there’s a checkbox for that in the install to do that for you
2240,2019-05-22T07:39:59.499900,Amparo,I mean developer debugging function anything ?
2240,2019-05-22T07:40:20.000400,Hiroko,"well, first, don’t use IDLE"
2240,2019-05-22T07:40:27.000800,Amparo,Yes <@Hiroko> I did that already
2240,2019-05-22T07:40:31.001200,Hiroko,I have no clue why its still included in the install
2240,2019-05-22T07:40:40.001700,Amparo,Now I can ran the sample code via sublime
2240,2019-05-22T07:40:45.002100,Hiroko,:thumbsup:
2240,2019-05-22T07:40:47.002200,Amparo,by press ctrl + B

2240,2019-05-22T07:41:25.003200,Amparo,I install two time. Both that time it installed inside c:python34
2240,2019-05-22T07:42:03.003400,Hiroko,ok
2240,2019-05-22T07:42:10.003700,Hiroko,but that’s not what we were saying
2240,2019-05-22T07:42:40.004400,Hiroko,we were saying system path in windows so its available to run outside with just the `python` command
2240,2019-05-22T07:42:57.004800,Hiroko,without needing to provide the entire `c:\python34.bin/python` path when executing your file
2240,2019-05-22T07:43:23.005100,Hiroko,"now, as far as debugging"
2240,2019-05-22T07:43:32.005400,Hiroko,I haven’t used sublime with python before
2240,2019-05-22T07:44:01.005700,Hiroko,have you looked for sublime packages for this?
2240,2019-05-22T07:44:12.006000,Hiroko,eg <https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Python%20Debugger>?
2240,2019-05-22T07:44:49.006400,Hiroko,uhm… question
2240,2019-05-22T07:44:54.006700,Hiroko,why are you installing python 3.4?
2240,2019-05-22T07:45:09.007200,Hiroko,"if you’re starting out, why not use 3.7?"
2240,2019-05-22T07:46:09.008300,Amparo,No. I'm asking find bug and debug . For ex)  if I pass the argument to the function mean How I can check the argument received to that functions or what values come for that particular arguments etc... Like developer debugging tool.
2240,2019-05-22T07:46:19.008500,Amparo,3.7 ?
2240,2019-05-22T07:46:57.009000,Amparo,Where I can download 3.7 ? For window 64 ?
2240,2019-05-22T07:47:06.009300,Amparo,Could you send me the exact URL ?

2240,2019-05-22T07:48:13.010500,Amparo,Which one I should choose ?
2240,2019-05-22T07:48:29.010800,Hiroko,stable 3.7
2240,2019-05-22T07:48:55.011900,Leida,executable installer x86-64 for 64 bit python
2240,2019-05-22T07:49:00.012100,Amparo,That will redirect to other link
2240,2019-05-22T07:49:18.012300,Hiroko,"that’s exactly what I’m pointing to with the link above.  sublime is an editor, not an IDE"
2240,2019-05-22T07:49:27.012700,Amparo,Got it
2240,2019-05-22T07:49:29.012900,Hiroko,so you need to add in the packages you want for the desired capability
2240,2019-05-22T07:50:07.013300,Amparo,Fine. Now back to debugging concept ?
2240,2019-05-22T07:50:24.013500,Amparo,I'm asking find bug and debug . For ex)  if I pass the argument to the function mean How I can check the argument received to that functions or what values come for that particular arguments etc... Like developer debugging tool.
2240,2019-05-22T07:50:44.014200,Hiroko,I already answered that for you :slightly_smiling_face:
2240,2019-05-22T07:50:48.014400,Hiroko,you’re using sublime
2240,2019-05-22T07:51:03.015100,Hiroko,"that’s an editor, not an IDE.  So if you want that, you need to install packages for that functionality"
2240,2019-05-22T07:51:27.015900,Hiroko,check out <https://realpython.com/setting-up-sublime-text-3-for-full-stack-python-development/> for some good package and configuration suggestions for ST
2240,2019-05-22T07:51:36.016200,Amparo,Fpr example in coldfusion if I dump( argument ) it will show all argument with its value in structure format. If I did abort(). then next line of any code will not excute
2240,2019-05-22T07:52:39.016800,Amparo,Sure. I will take a look on your link <@Hiroko> Thank you
2240,2019-05-22T07:52:48.017000,Hiroko,"ok, gotcha.  I think you’re going to find a very different experience with non coldfusion languages"
2240,2019-05-22T07:53:00.017500,Amparo,Yes :slightly_smiling_face:
2240,2019-05-22T07:53:07.017700,Hiroko,"FWIW, I have java, c, php, javascript and python experience"
2240,2019-05-22T07:53:28.018300,Hiroko,none of those languages really have similar things
2240,2019-05-22T07:53:43.018800,Hiroko,"well, php has `var_dump`"
2240,2019-05-22T07:54:03.019700,Amparo,Yes you got it my point clearly
2240,2019-05-22T07:54:04.019900,Hiroko,"you can do the same in python with `print(globals()`, and `print(locals())`"
2240,2019-05-22T07:54:06.020000,Leida,"<https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows> you can try the community edition to see if that works for you, but you would still have to learn to use it first"
2240,2019-05-22T07:54:19.020400,Amparo,So there is any way for it ?
2240,2019-05-22T07:54:39.021000,Hiroko,how many IDEs are there for CF?
2240,2019-05-22T07:55:37.021500,Amparo,"Sublime, Vs code, coldfusion builder ( By default )"
2240,2019-05-22T07:56:31.021900,My,So. Many. Notifications. :smile:
2240,2019-05-22T07:56:59.022300,Leida,you can try with vs code too <https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/debugging%20python>
2240,2019-05-22T07:58:02.022800,Amparo,Huh using VS code it's slow my system
2240,2019-05-22T07:58:13.023100,Amparo,Even I'm having good configuration system

2240,2019-05-22T08:00:22.025500,Leida,if you dont use an ide which are more heavy weight then you are gonna have to put in more elbow grease to get things to work
2240,2019-05-22T08:00:47.026200,Leida,can be a bit of fiddling and i personally havent worked with sublime to know what needs to be done
2240,2019-05-22T08:01:05.026600,Amparo,SO you mean IDLE is best by default ?
2240,2019-05-22T08:02:00.027400,My,personnally I never run code inside of sublime
2240,2019-05-22T08:02:08.027700,Leida,"aparently it does have a debugger inbulit - never used it. Certainly not the best, but is probably relatively light weight. <https://www.cs.uky.edu/~keen/help/debug-tutorial/debug.html>"

2240,2019-05-22T08:14:03.035200,Hiroko,sure you’re using the same git?
2241,2019-05-22T08:14:12.035600,Hiroko,what does `which git` return in both?
2242,2019-05-22T08:38:03.036000,Alvina,no - one is on windows (C: drive) and the other is /usr/bin/git
2242,2019-05-22T08:38:23.036500,Alvina,did not realize that would matter - I thought it used the .git subfolder to keep track

2250,2019-05-22T15:55:48.061100,Gisela,"Hello,
Have anybody unittested - sqlalchemy? I have a case similar to here: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44539816/real-unit-testing-of-sqlalchemy-in-flask>
- I think the answer is great - I would say exactly the same…
Before seeing it I took approach with mocking necessary objects. I hit the wall when I got the the part of code that creates the query part in `filter`:
```
... _and(my_table.columns.datetime &gt;= datetime(2018, 1, 1))
```
MagicMocks are not comparable :slightly_smiling_face:

I’m also thinking of changing the approach and using something like `betamax` for db - is there a library like that for sqlalchemy?"
2251,2019-05-22T16:26:05.061700,Karoline,are you trying to mock the deep behavior of SQLAlchemy itself?
2251,2019-05-22T16:29:25.063700,Karoline,"I think the best approach is going to be a mix of things though - isolating your database access and accessing it through an interface as is mentioned in #4 in the accepted answer there is good for testing most of your code, then you can just replace that interface."
2251,2019-05-22T16:29:43.064100,Karoline,"then when doing fuller integration tests, there's no replacement for a real database in my opinion."
2251,2019-05-22T16:29:54.064400,Karoline,test against the version of the db you deploy against.
2251,2019-05-22T16:31:08.065600,Gisela,basically the class is a simple client working with defined interface
2251,2019-05-22T16:31:20.066000,Gisela,I just didn’t want to skip it from coverage
2251,2019-05-22T16:33:33.067800,Karoline,"if it's a simple client gluing together calls to a db, honestly the only value you'll really get form testing it will be testing it against a real db."
2251,2019-05-22T16:34:54.069100,Gisela,what I wanted to achieve is to test if two queries in the method were called
2251,2019-05-22T16:36:28.070800,Gisela,"I know it’s simple test, that could’ve been covered probably by testing with test db instance, I just want to know how to test properly as an unittest - more for learning reasons - I just don’t like the idea of “it cannot be unittested”"
2251,2019-05-22T16:38:31.072800,Karoline,"you  can mock it as you've said.  not sure how much value there is there though, really."
2251,2019-05-22T16:39:14.073600,Gisela,with that version of testing there’s still problem of the comparison of mocks
2251,2019-05-22T16:39:31.074000,Gisela,let’s call it academic reason :wink:
2251,2019-05-22T16:41:39.076100,Gisela,"the problem is in the deeper magic of sqlalchemy (how it creates queries and `compare`) - I would have to add it to mocked objects, and that’s too much…"
2251,2019-05-22T16:42:21.076500,Karoline,"oh - I think see, sorry, I see you had a more concrete issue, I thought you were more speaking generally."
2251,2019-05-22T16:42:49.077000,Karoline,you can override `__eq__`
2251,2019-05-22T16:42:58.077600,Karoline,"on the mocked object, to return True"
2251,2019-05-22T16:43:20.078400,Gisela,"tried to do that with `__le__`,  to `__gt__`"
2251,2019-05-22T16:43:41.079100,Gisela,as there’s ‘&gt;=’
2251,2019-05-22T16:43:42.079200,Krystal,Is it ok to fetch and parse an RSS feed in short time intervals? Is it harmful for the RSS link provider?
2251,2019-05-22T16:44:44.079700,Karoline,"you want `__ge__` then, right?"
2251,2019-05-22T16:45:08.080100,Gisela,"yes - didn’t work, but I’ll double check, although I did not add `__eq__` there"
2251,2019-05-22T16:45:28.080300,Karoline,there's some discussion here: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#magic-mock>
2251,2019-05-22T16:45:37.080700,Karoline,with some examples.  should work.
2251,2019-05-22T16:51:30.081500,Gisela,thx :slightly_smiling_face:
2251,2019-05-22T16:52:06.082300,Gisela,and regarding way of testing with something like a “record”?
2251,2019-05-22T16:52:54.083100,Gisela,is there a lib like that for sqlalchemy? Like `betamax`?
2251,2019-05-22T16:54:13.084600,Karoline,"maybe, but I'm not sure how much of a good idea that is. isolate that code and mock it at the boundaries of tests for your business logic, and test it in integration tests against a real database."
2251,2019-05-22T16:54:28.085000,Karoline,a unittest of basically sqlalchemy code is just testing that sqlalchemy works.
2251,2019-05-22T16:54:53.085400,Karoline,you know that - what you want to know is if everything works at the integration points
2251,2019-05-22T16:57:18.085600,Gisela,that’s true
2251,2019-05-22T16:58:36.087200,Gisela,"implementing `__le__` worked, I had to double check the `return_value....__le__` path :slightly_smiling_face:"
2251,2019-05-22T16:59:19.087800,Karoline,ah yeah it can always be tricky to make sure you have it all just right

2254,2019-05-22T18:10:41.095300,Clemmie,You can also do `return self.last_name == other.last_name` you don't need to check the comparison and then return the same statement
2255,2019-05-22T23:28:47.097100,Lynnette,I think that `__import__` has been deprecated in favor of the `importlib` module

2256,2019-05-23T04:17:52.104200,Carlee,"First we have to understand what's meant by ""Thread Safety"""
2256,2019-05-23T04:18:30.104900,Carlee,"from wikipedia
&gt; Thread safety is a computer programming concept applicable to multi-threaded code. Thread-safe code only manipulates shared data structures in a manner that ensures that all threads behave properly and fulfill their design specifications without unintended interaction. There are various strategies for making thread-safe data structures."
2256,2019-05-23T04:20:04.107000,Leida,if you have some processing running in another thread that does not depend on any data in your main logic other than what you give it at the start and it does not need access to any shared data then its safe
2256,2019-05-23T04:20:52.108000,Leida,as long as you dont have mutable shared state you should be fine
2256,2019-05-23T04:21:48.109000,Guillermina,"Thanks for the question <@Rubie> - today I learned something...
Here's a good read on the topic: <https://opensource.com/article/17/4/grok-gil>

&gt; So, despite the GIL, you still need locks to protect shared mutable state [if the operation is not atomic]"
2256,2019-05-23T04:22:31.109800,Leida,for example i was doing USB communications in a separate thread because it was really slow and i needed my main logic to do other stuff at the same time so i could push that USB communications into a separate thread and do other stuff until the code in the other thread was ready to give me the output
2256,2019-05-23T04:24:00.111100,Carlee,Shared mutable state is evil
2256,2019-05-23T04:24:03.111300,Leida,so you can have multithreaded software without worries of thread safety IF the task you are trying to accomplish can be done in that way
2256,2019-05-23T04:24:40.112100,Leida,so your question of having been asked to write multithreaded software that is thread safe can be relatively trivial or a nightmare depending on the actual task
2256,2019-05-23T04:27:23.113500,Rubie,"Yeah i think i understand better, <@Guillermina> that article is a good source."

2259,2019-05-23T05:12:25.118700,Rubie,"Sorry to be a pain, but is sorted() thread safe? how do i check this :cry:"
2259,2019-05-23T05:12:58.119000,Rubie,Or how can i check if operations are atomic or not
2259,2019-05-23T05:16:17.119900,Carlee,as far as I know `sorted` is thread safe because it makes a copy of the list and doesn't mutate the original list.
2259,2019-05-23T05:19:00.121600,Carlee,"I guess the key is to understand ""shared mutable state""....
- mutable state is thead safe if its not shared
- shared state is thread safe if its not mutable."
2259,2019-05-23T05:28:23.122900,Leida,ah there is `sort` there not `sorted`
2260,2019-05-23T05:27:34.122500,Leida,as the article explained `sorted` is thread safe by being a single bytecode and thus uninterruptable by GIL
2260,2019-05-23T05:28:52.123500,Leida,but you can follow the same example and use `dis.dis()`
2260,2019-05-23T05:32:36.124000,Leida,"oh, really Shoviks answer pretty much covers it anyway"
2260,2019-05-23T05:37:54.124200,Leida,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...   return sorted(lst)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis.dis(foo)
  2           0 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (sorted)

2261,2019-05-23T06:27:30.131000,Tanja,"ok. I tried that, when I remove: `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` it didn't get the previous error but gives me : ```Traceback (most recent call last):

2263,2019-05-23T11:49:10.136300,Holly,you can't put spaces in like that it has to be in http lingo

2263,2019-05-23T11:49:57.138100,Holly,when you put spaces in your curl command like that it tries to resolve each one as a host
2263,2019-05-23T11:50:19.138800,Holly,"just an FYI though, its not very advisable to have an exposed API that takes direct SQL queries, it can be pretty unsafe"

2263,2019-05-23T11:51:51.140300,Hana,I'm pretty new to this would be helpful if you could suggest
2263,2019-05-23T12:02:20.140600,Holly,"generally if you're making an api, you'd want another library that handles the database queries"
2263,2019-05-23T12:02:25.140800,Holly,like sqlalchemy
2263,2019-05-23T12:02:50.141400,Holly,"and when someone sends an api request for some data, you pass that data to a function and that function performs the lookup in the database and returns it"
2263,2019-05-23T12:03:18.142100,Holly,"that allows you to control what type of data gets sent to your database, so someone can't just put in a query into the api call and then get all the information in your database"
2263,2019-05-23T12:07:04.142500,Hana,got you ryan..will work on it and get back to you
2263,2019-05-23T12:10:29.143200,Carmen,"The keyword you're needing for that type of vulnerability is ""SQL injection""."
2263,2019-05-23T12:11:16.144100,Holly,lol yeah
2263,2019-05-23T12:11:20.144300,Carmen,"There's an insane amount written about it, since it's one of the oldest and most venerable exploits for websites, pretty much since the web started and people were running database-driven websites."
2263,2019-05-23T12:11:53.144800,Holly,its also one of the most common due to api construction and data validation being missed :slightly_smiling_face:

2263,2019-05-23T13:16:51.150200,Holly,"hmmm, I thought order of operations would negate that"
2263,2019-05-23T13:16:52.150300,Clemmie,"since the length is evaluated at the beginning, if you del even one you will get an index error"
2263,2019-05-23T13:16:57.150500,Holly,yeah makes sense
2263,2019-05-23T13:17:03.150800,Holly,I guess I should just append the values to a new list
2263,2019-05-23T13:17:08.151100,Holly,that makes sense
2263,2019-05-23T13:17:22.151600,Clemmie,"you could, or just use a list comprehension, it's cleaner"
2263,2019-05-23T13:17:25.151900,Carlo,this loop is the perfect moment to introduce filter too
2263,2019-05-23T13:17:40.152800,Holly,I'd love to use a list comprehension I'm just so bad at them
2263,2019-05-23T13:17:42.153000,Holly,lol
2263,2019-05-23T13:17:42.153100,Sasha,You can also iterate from the end of the list down to the beginning.
2263,2019-05-23T13:17:46.153400,Holly,probably a could opportunity to learn
2263,2019-05-23T13:17:56.153700,Holly,<@Sasha> that's also a good thought
2263,2019-05-23T13:18:05.153900,Clemmie,`return [roll for roll in rolls if roll &gt;= to_hit]`
2263,2019-05-23T13:18:53.155100,Clemmie,"yeah, you also don't need the length and i, just iterating through the objects. But deleting from your iterator while iterating is almost always going to cause problems at some point"
2263,2019-05-23T13:19:09.155500,Holly,that makes perfect sense

2268,2019-05-23T18:45:41.188600,Nikki,and 'bath lift' being the second value in the value pair list
2268,2019-05-23T18:50:55.189900,Sasha,"Nope, you need to loop through it, I'm afraid. If it is a performance issue or a common operation, you might want to construct a second dictionary with the reverse mapping, i.e. use `'bath lift'` as a key and the rest of the data as a value."

2268,2019-05-23T19:01:31.191700,Sasha,"At least syntactically, you can do it easily with something like `matches = [x for x in data if 'bath lift' in x['keys']]`, for instance. But it's still a loop."

2276,2019-05-24T06:45:27.037800,Nigel,"<@Greta> There is a thing in python called ""name mangling"" which happens if you prefix a variable or a function with double underscore like in `__define_node` case. When you do this, at runtime this method turns into a `_ClassName__define_node` for the parent class and for all subclasses to emulate ""private"" keyword from C++ or Java. You can read about it here: <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#atom-identifiers> and here: <https://stackoverflow.com/q/7456807/3606603>

In your particular case, if you want to reuse `__define_node` from the parent class, you should change its name to `_define_node` - with a single leading underscore"

2291,2019-05-25T09:36:49.118300,Vern,"Good morning.  I am working with Panadas for the first time, and so far really liking it.  I am trying to do some analysis on phone records.  long term there are a few things I want to do, but focus right now is determining maximum number of concurrent calls to the PSTN at an individual location.  I have functioning code for this, but pretty sure there is a much better way of doing this (this works, but its slow).  the part below is the part I'm sure there is a better way.  prior to this snippet of code I am reading the CSV file(125 column, 15000 rows) into a dataframe, filtering it down to just the PSTN Calls, and just the columns I used for that purpose I end out with a dataframe that is is about 10250x6.  I'm then running it through loop below to poll the data and check minute by minute in my interested time period how many calls were active at the polling time.  This works ok, but it is slow, and I'm going to be missing data still (calls that start and end between polling periods), There are a few ways I can think of to catch those calls as well but it's going to make this even slower..is there a better way I should be doing this?  The idea is with the output then I can quickly find the max calls, I can graph the data show trending,  etc.
```
# create empty Dataframe to store results
call_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['dateTime', 'activeCalls'])

# Loop through times in one minute incremenets between start and end time
for x in pd.date_range(start=start_time, end=end_time, freq=""1Min""):
    # count number of calls that started before and ended after loop time
    active_calls = len(pstn_calls[(pstn_calls['origTime'] &lt;= x) &amp; pstn_calls['disconnectTime'] &gt;= x)])
    # append results to DataFrame
    call_df = call_df.append({'dateTime': x, 'activeCalls': active_calls}, ignore_index=True)
```"
2291,2019-05-25T11:59:08.120400,Sasha,"<@Vern> A couple of things come to mind. One solution would be to start with an array of zeroes for every minute you want to get statistics for, and then loop through each call record once, adding a one for every minute between the start time and end time."
2291,2019-05-25T12:00:51.121700,Sasha,"Another way would be to sort the start times and end times, and perform a running sum, so you'd end up with a list of times at which the concurrent call count changed, and to what new value."

2296,2019-05-25T14:07:53.141400,Sasha,It may be that the pipe is buffering output somewhere. You might try adding `flush=True` to your `print` call in your connector script.
2296,2019-05-25T14:09:13.141800,Sasha,There's also a `-u` flag you can pass to `python` to get unbuffered output.

2298,2019-05-25T17:41:40.146800,Sasha,"There's a mix of quoting types in there, so a string conversion could probably get pretty messy. Perhaps `ast.literal_eval()` is safe enough?"

2300,2019-05-26T07:03:20.157000,Bethany,actually there'sa  few intermediates. `spacy` is a good nlp library. Or go with a vendor chatbot solution like google dialogflow
2300,2019-05-26T07:09:24.158000,Conchita,I think I will go with regex then as `{keyword} in string` will be to simple and neural nets too complex

2305,2019-05-27T02:50:48.181600,Christina,"that depends on your OS. this is not really a python question, as it is simply depended on whether `python`is symlinked to `python3.*` or `python2.*` (on unix systems anyway..)

What OS are you using?"
2305,2019-05-27T02:53:00.181800,Chester,"Also, linking `python` to `python3` when your linux distro has it linked to `python2` will likely break everything"
2305,2019-05-27T02:53:09.182000,Christina,true!
2305,2019-05-27T02:53:43.182200,Christina,"so it also depends on which distro you use. but i hope the majority of your packages rely on py3, but that is probably naive"
2305,2019-05-27T02:54:39.182400,Tanja,I'm using Ubuntu
2305,2019-05-27T02:54:58.182600,Chester,<@Tanja> I'd suggest to use <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>
2305,2019-05-27T02:55:17.182900,Chester,This cannot possibly break anything
2305,2019-05-27T02:55:25.183100,Tanja,the Idea is that most packages I'm working with requires python3
2305,2019-05-27T02:56:19.183300,Tanja,I'm not working with virtual environment another way?
2305,2019-05-27T02:56:52.183500,Christina,You should use virtual environments. However you can (also) add a alias mapping py to python3 in your .bashrc/zshrc (or what ever shell you use)
2305,2019-05-27T02:58:14.183700,Chester,A virtual environment is bound to the interpreter used to create it. It cannot manage different python versions on the same machine
2305,2019-05-27T02:58:18.183900,Chester,pyenv can
2305,2019-05-27T02:59:29.184100,Tanja,"if I used `locate python3` It gives looong &amp; many  paths, how should I knew which one I have to use"
2305,2019-05-27T02:59:29.184300,Christina,oic. well then pyenv should be your goto thing. but virtual environments are quite cool as well
2305,2019-05-27T02:59:48.184500,Christina,use `which python3` not `locate python3` - locate finds all files that has `python3`it its name afaik
2305,2019-05-27T03:01:57.184800,Tanja,ok.
2305,2019-05-27T03:03:25.185000,Christina,"`which python3` means ""upon writing `python3` which file is executed?`"
2305,2019-05-27T03:03:54.185200,Tanja,"another question please, If I want to work with pyenv, what will happen to the already downloaded packages, like pymesh, plt,and I have to reinstall all in the pyenv?"
2305,2019-05-27T03:06:16.185400,Chester,"Yes. As I said, virtual environments are bound to the interpreter used to create it. pyenv installs completely separate interpreters"
2305,2019-05-27T03:07:03.185600,Christina,<@Tanja> you hopefully use `requirements.txt` to save those :wink:
2305,2019-05-27T03:08:08.185800,Tanja,Sorry guys I don't ave advanced knowledge in python so I feel not getting exactly the idea you are talking about :disappointed:
2305,2019-05-27T03:17:51.186200,Christina,"It's more of a linux thing than i python thing. So when using pyenv it creates an isolated 'environment' which has a singular interpreter (a `python3` executeable basically). Linked to that interpreter is an isolated set of modules etc. So when changing into a new environment, you can only access the packages that is installed on that specific interpreter.
when activating a specific environment it creates an alias for that terminal that connects the command `python` to the specific interpreter. If you use Pycharm (the IDE / editor), you can also connect the editor to the specific environment. (probably the same for other editors)


Normally, when using python (especially with virtual environments) you define a file called `requirements.txt` which stores the names of all packages a given project is depended on. (<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files>)"
2305,2019-05-27T03:27:01.186600,Tanja,but does this mean I can remove all the packages (installed without pyenv) normally and this won't affect my new work on the pyenv
2305,2019-05-27T03:29:46.186800,Christina,"i think it depends on the setup. i haven't used pyenv (i use virtualenv, which is  similar), but some solutions makes en environment inherit from the global modules. but *i would* install everything in the env and then remove the global packages (just make sure it is packages that you hav manually installed, and not something ubuntu depends on)"
2305,2019-05-27T03:30:06.187000,Chester,pyenv and virtualenv are two completely different tools
2305,2019-05-27T03:30:56.187200,Chester,"pyenv manages different python interpreters (e.g. py2.6, py2.7, py3.5, py3.6, etc), virtualenv manages project-specific python packages (i.e. things that are installed with `pip install`)"
2305,2019-05-27T03:34:57.187400,Christina,oic. but isn't the packages still interpreter specific? :slightly_smiling_face:
2305,2019-05-27T03:35:26.187600,Chester,Sure
2305,2019-05-27T04:04:23.188200,Chester,Both.
2305,2019-05-27T04:16:29.192100,Chester,"I have a very simple rule to decide whether a field should be a property or a method.
If computing this field requires I/O or any other sort of interactions with external systems (e.g. other classes that serve configuration), then it has to be a method.
If computing requires only the data available in `self`, then it should be a property.
If it requires no computing (i.e. the whole implementation is `return self._field`), then it should be just a regular field."
2305,2019-05-27T04:28:50.193000,Nigel,Plus one to <@Chester>'s rules of thumb. This MIT lecture is probably written by some old Java fart

2306,2019-05-27T04:02:03.187800,Tanja,So as a beginner which one preferably to use
2306,2019-05-27T04:02:19.188000,Tanja,`virtualenv` or `pyenv`
2306,2019-05-27T04:10:03.188400,Jung,"This is from the MIT lecture.
Why? I don't understand, why better use `a.get_age()` instead `a.age`?"
2306,2019-05-27T04:12:00.189100,Jimmy,I don't really agree with that tbh
2306,2019-05-27T04:12:24.189600,Jimmy,I python it's easy to make  `a.age` do something else thanks to `property` if needed later on

2307,2019-05-27T04:49:53.194900,Leida,getters and setters are from statically typed OOP languages
2307,2019-05-27T04:50:34.195800,Leida,i think in C# or java was where all internal parameter access is reccommended to have getters and setters by default
2307,2019-05-27T04:51:20.196700,Leida,its so that you wont have to modify your interfaces when you need to add something to the access like logging or counting or what not
2307,2019-05-27T04:53:12.197900,Leida,its not a python thing to do. If you blindly bring OOP principles from c#/java to python you can end up with redundancy.
2307,2019-05-27T04:57:36.200400,Chester,"&gt; its so that you wont have to modify your interfaces when you need to add something to the access like logging or counting or what not
It's kinda stupid though. People make certain assumptions about how functions/methods operate.
If I see a `getName` method in java, I'd expect it to run blazingly fast - because it's essentially a field lookup. I'd call it a gazillion times without fear.
If it will do I/O tomorrow, then I'd have a hard time figuring why my program became so slow."

2307,2019-05-27T04:58:20.201500,Leida,c# has built in shorthand to declare everything as getters and setters
2307,2019-05-27T05:01:11.203700,Leida,<@Chester> another thing is that if you really change the implementation in the getters and setters then you are likely to break the interface anyway

2309,2019-05-27T07:30:32.215900,Jennette,I am writing ui page verification using selenium webdriver
2309,2019-05-27T07:31:10.216800,Jennette,"any workaround, like writing some custom decorator?"
2309,2019-05-27T07:32:17.217200,Chester,You can always do `assert a.isLink() and b.isButton() and c.DropDown()`
2309,2019-05-27T07:32:31.217400,Chester,which is still kinda ugly
2309,2019-05-27T07:32:45.217800,Chester,"you'd better have separate tests, as <@Hiroko> said"
2309,2019-05-27T07:32:54.218000,Jennette,this just an expample
2309,2019-05-27T07:33:47.219200,Chester,"Okay, so? This tiny example already contains a very dangerous testing habit of mixing different tests into one"
2309,2019-05-27T07:34:01.219500,Hiroko,"asserts act as conditionals for tests, effectively.  True means the test continues, False means test fails and doesn’t continue"
2309,2019-05-27T07:34:31.220200,Jennette,I agree with both of you
2309,2019-05-27T07:34:39.220700,Hiroko,"its basically equivalent to

```if this:
...
if that:
...
if baz:
...
```"
2309,2019-05-27T07:35:07.221200,Jennette,my problem is I need to verify all UI controls on each page
2309,2019-05-27T07:35:33.222100,Jennette,I can not write one case for one controls verification
2309,2019-05-27T07:35:36.222300,Hiroko,break it up into individual tests and have your webdriver instanciate once per test class
2309,2019-05-27T07:35:46.222600,Hiroko,yes you should
2309,2019-05-27T07:35:57.223000,Jennette,thanks my friend
2309,2019-05-27T07:36:06.223500,Jennette,but that will not work in my case
2309,2019-05-27T07:36:08.223600,Chester,<@Jennette> verify how?
2309,2019-05-27T07:36:36.224100,Hiroko,is this is an end-to-end test?
2309,2019-05-27T07:36:42.224300,Jennette,yes

2309,2019-05-27T07:37:59.226000,Chester,"Do you need to verify that your pages look like expected? Or you're actually clicking on these buttons, select options from drop downs, etc"
2309,2019-05-27T07:38:09.226100,Jennette,I found this some thing relevant
2309,2019-05-27T07:39:33.227700,Jennette,"I am verifying that page have all expected link, and on click links working as expected, all expect input fields and all input fields are editable, all expected images, all expected button exits and they are clickable"

2309,2019-05-27T07:41:11.230300,Nigel,I started to hate this idea right after working with Jasmine (js testing framework) for some time :harold:
2309,2019-05-27T07:41:25.230600,Nigel,(idea of delayed asserts I mean)
2309,2019-05-27T07:42:41.232000,Jennette,"is it possible to write a custom decorator() , and on testcase just add @contine_on_fail. and it continue for all assertion , and once case execution finish it display all fail asserrtion"
2309,2019-05-27T07:43:02.232600,Chester,"Then if you really need to test that your site looks like expected, then there are other testing frameworks for that, e.g. <https://applitools.com/blog/visual-testing-a-guide-for-front-end-developers>"
2309,2019-05-27T07:44:15.234000,Chester,"I honestly cannot imagine how your tests will grow in time, if you're going to create a test function per page"
2309,2019-05-27T07:44:41.234600,Chester,in which you're going to check _almost every single element_ of the page
2309,2019-05-27T07:45:20.235700,Jennette,"we are doing UI chnage in next version , and we want that UI verification for next version"
2309,2019-05-27T07:45:37.236000,Chester,"I'd vote for that approach to be remotely useful for the first couple of sprints, after that it will be a huge mess"
2309,2019-05-27T07:45:51.236200,Jennette,:disappointed:
2309,2019-05-27T07:47:02.237400,Chester,"Again, ""verification"" is a very broad term when it comes to UIs.
Verification of the ""look"" is one thing, verification of the ""behavior"" is another. You seem to mix them."
2309,2019-05-27T07:48:36.238300,Jennette,we need to verify that controls exists and behavior does not chanage
2309,2019-05-27T07:49:17.239000,Chester,Do you care how they look like? Where are they placed on the page? Are they even visible to the user?
2309,2019-05-27T07:50:04.239400,Jennette,I care if they are visbile
2309,2019-05-27T07:50:11.239700,Jennette,not place
2309,2019-05-27T07:51:39.241000,Chester,"How you're going to check that?
You can't simply check for `display: none`. What if one fully functional control will be rendered outside of the viewport?"
2309,2019-05-27T07:52:01.241500,Chester,What if one control will completely overflow another?
2309,2019-05-27T07:52:52.242500,Chester,"You need to ask these questions to yourself, what kinds of UI changes you want to make, and I guarantee that ""all existing elements and controls, and their behaviors"" is not what you usually want to test"
2309,2019-05-27T07:53:42.243800,Jennette,ok
2309,2019-05-27T07:54:57.245100,Chester,"Let's say you want to test a click on a button. Why would you do that? It's already being tested during your browser's development process. All you need to do is to comply to the spec of the button.
Are you overriding default, well-tested behavior in javascript? Then test that javascript, because if you still test clicking on a button, then you're mostly testing browser's behavior, delegating the submit action to javascript"
2309,2019-05-27T07:55:25.245500,Jennette,ok
2309,2019-05-27T07:55:31.245700,Hiroko,"this brings up an additional question, are you doing unit testing too?"
2309,2019-05-27T07:55:57.246300,Hiroko,"and if so, what’s your coverage for the code which executes the rendering and behavior?"
2309,2019-05-27T07:56:52.246800,Jennette,"I am in meeting, will reply you soon"
2309,2019-05-27T07:57:02.247100,Jennette,thanks for your time
2309,2019-05-27T08:55:58.249800,Ashley,"<@Jennette> in order to avoid your tests taking an eternity to run, you basically want to avoid involving anything in any particular test that you don't absolutely need in order to test that behavior. So unless the actual core behavior you're testing depends on how that unique browser would behave, then you don't need to involve the browser."
2310,2019-05-27T08:57:08.251000,Ashley,"For example, if your site has a standard `&lt;form&gt;`, and it doesn't use javascript to handle the submission on that form so it just `POST`s to a specific endpoint, then you don't need a browser to test that form"
2310,2019-05-27T08:57:44.251600,Ashley,you can just send a `POST` request yourself to that endpoint
2310,2019-05-27T08:58:35.252500,Ashley,"(however, you may need to use a `Session` from `requests` to track cookies and headers and such to make sure you have access to that form)"
2310,2019-05-27T08:58:55.253000,Jennette,i will look into this approch
2310,2019-05-27T08:58:59.253200,Ashley,going further
2310,2019-05-27T09:00:20.254600,Ashley,"if you are trying to test some behavior that happens exclusively on the backend, e.g. calculating tax based on location and cost of the purchase, then you should probably handle that in a unit test without needing any network connection at all"

2311,2019-05-27T10:30:35.257700,Nigel,It'll return `name_1`

2311,2019-05-27T10:33:10.259000,Nigel,"if you want the whole dictionary returned together with `name_1`, you can use `data.items()`:

2314,2019-05-28T01:53:15.272400,Derek,Hey all. I’m working on Python Crash Course and am stuck with writing a dynamic view in Django. If I try to run the code in the shell for my view I’m seeing this:
2314,2019-05-28T01:53:22.272500,Derek,None
2314,2019-05-28T01:53:47.273500,Derek,"I’m not sure what entry_set is or does, I’ve tried looking back at the examples and can’t understand what is being done here"
2314,2019-05-28T01:54:06.273800,Derek,The example uses it like this:
2314,2019-05-28T01:54:10.273900,Derek,None
2314,2019-05-28T01:54:50.274400,Derek,These are my models:
2314,2019-05-28T01:54:54.274500,Derek,None
2314,2019-05-28T02:01:04.276400,Sasha,"The example probably has an actual `Entry` model connected via a foreign key, which would create the `entry_set` accessor. In this case, you might have a `topping_set` instead."
2314,2019-05-28T02:01:15.276700,Derek,Ahhh it should be topping_set
2314,2019-05-28T02:06:44.277100,Derek,Thanks <@Sasha>!
2315,2019-05-28T03:26:29.278400,Reatha,can any one help me to convert this format in python $carData['overview']['fuel_type'][3] = 'Fuel Type';
2315,2019-05-28T03:28:10.279000,Sasha,"Leave off the `$` and the `;`, and it would be a valid Python expression, depending on the data in `carData`."
2315,2019-05-28T03:29:12.279400,Reatha,actual its a list and i am using it in django
2315,2019-05-28T03:29:23.279700,Reatha,cardata = []
2315,2019-05-28T03:30:13.280300,Sasha,"Well, a list can't have named keys like `'overview'`, so what is it that you want here?"
2315,2019-05-28T03:31:40.281200,Reatha,carData['overview']['fuel_type'][3] = 'Fuel Type'; in laravel its takes string is there any way i can assign string index
2315,2019-05-28T03:32:21.281700,Sasha,You would typically use a (nested) dict instead of a list.
2315,2019-05-28T03:32:39.282000,Reatha,ok can you give me an example
2315,2019-05-28T03:34:34.283400,Sasha,"```carData = {
  'overview': {
    'fuel_type': {
      3: 'Fuel Type'
    }
  }
}```
That would initialize a nested dict with those keys and values."
2315,2019-05-28T03:35:27.284000,Reatha,ok ty its a json format too
2315,2019-05-28T03:35:55.284400,Sasha,"Yeah, if you're starting from JSON, you can parse that straight to Python data structures."
2315,2019-05-28T03:39:40.284900,Reatha,how can i insert another data in fuel_type
2315,2019-05-28T03:39:45.285100,Reatha,"carData = {
  'overview': {
    'fuel_type': {
      3: 'Fuel Type'
    }
  }
}"
2315,2019-05-28T03:40:08.285300,Reatha,"carData = {
        'overview': {
            'fuel_type': {
                3: 'Fuel Type',
                2: 'Petrol'
            }
        }
    }"
2315,2019-05-28T03:42:05.287000,Latashia,"if 'fuel_type' is array, you can use
```
'fuel_type': ['type 0', 'type 1', 'type 2', 'type 3']
```"
2315,2019-05-28T03:43:13.288300,Sasha,"Once the higher-level structures is set up, you can just do `carData['overview']['fuel_type'][2] = 'Petrol'` to add another leaf value."
2315,2019-05-28T03:43:37.288700,Russ,or `carData['overview']['fuel_type'].update({2: 'Petrol'})`

2317,2019-05-28T07:06:18.291000,Lanelle,what is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in python
2317,2019-05-28T07:07:07.291400,Hiroko,the depth level in which the copy operation goes
2317,2019-05-28T07:08:23.292200,Hiroko,"the docs explain it preety well, have you looked there?"
2317,2019-05-28T07:08:24.292400,Hiroko,<https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/copy.html>
2317,2019-05-28T07:09:04.292900,Hiroko,"&gt;&gt;&gt;The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or class instances):
• A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.
• A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.

Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that don’t exist with shallow copy operations:
• Recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly, contain a reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop.
• Because deep copy copies everything it may copy too much, such as data which is intended to be shared between copies."

I have two different issues with django 2.2.1 combined with Heroku CI:

*one* being that the `DATABASES` in the settings file for some reason is defined recursively. so the `default` value holds a key `TEST`which includes the content of default as well as a key `TEST` (etc). this is mainly a problem as django tries to sanitize the settings file, which hangs indefinitely, upon trying to show a stack trace

the *second* being that the CI throws the following exception when tearing down the test run `django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: (1064, ""You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'CASCADE;\n CREATE SCHEMA public;\n GRANT ALL' at line 1"")`. utilizing JawsDB with (maybe? not sure how to verify) mysql 8.0.

I also asked sunday but got no result. if anyone has a clue as to how to fix it or (even better) how to find the solution myself."
2319,2019-05-28T08:04:58.306500,Lolita,better define it in the class itself… MyClass(data).to_dict()
2319,2019-05-28T08:06:58.306800,Lolita,Because I guess the conversion logic is specific to the class.
2319,2019-05-28T08:08:51.307400,Christina,"you could utilize __dict__ (or override it, but that might cause weird behaviour) - but i don't think there is a specific naming convention for that concern. not AFAIK atleast. but i would also say it should be a method on the instance"
2319,2019-05-28T08:11:10.307600,Lolita,I’m sure Django and Heroku both has active slack or other IRL communities where they are most active. You may find your answers in those channels sooner.
2319,2019-05-28T08:12:02.307800,Lolita,There’s a separate channel for Django even in this comminity
2319,2019-05-28T08:13:31.308000,Lolita,I don’t think we should ever mess with __dict__.
2319,2019-05-28T08:18:07.308400,Lolita,BTW __dict__ is a dict instance not a method. It holds all the state of the object in it.
2319,2019-05-28T08:19:58.308700,Christina,i asked sunday in <#C0LMFRMB5|django> :wink: but never really got an answer. i mean it's rather specific. overlap. where the issues seem to be with mysql and and the heroku integration with django. the django_heroku git rep doesn't really seem that active. it has a whole lot of unanswered issues.
2319,2019-05-28T08:26:00.308900,Lolita,"I think you can try redefining the questions better with code examples and ways to reproduce the issue. If you feel it’s a bug, you can create an issue to the respective repos (search for already closed issues before creating one). There will be issue templates guiding you to define the exact problem better so that others don’t have to spend much effort understanding it."
2319,2019-05-28T08:32:53.309100,Christina,yeah true. I should probably just have created a minimalistic example where i would hopefully get the same problem. i tried changing from mysql to postgres for the tests and now everything works
2319,2019-05-28T08:41:56.309500,Chester,I'd suggest to take a look at <http://attrs.org|attrs.org>
2319,2019-05-28T08:42:01.309700,Chester,"Specifically, <http://www.attrs.org/en/stable/api.html#attr.asdict>"
2320,2019-05-28T08:33:01.309300,Christina,so i got that going for me which is nice
2321,2019-05-28T09:16:01.310500,Ashley,"Trying to create a minimal example is a great approach, and can often lead you to better understand both the question(s) you actually need to ask, and the tool you're working with"
2321,2019-05-28T09:20:08.310700,Ashley,"It sounds like you have a super complex means of getting those settings in place and it's having unexpected behavior. I would try to rework that system so it's much simpler and straightforward, and hopefully that will clear up that problem. You can also have multiple settings files and point at specific ones for the environment you want to run in, if you aren't doing that already"
2321,2019-05-28T09:21:01.310900,Ashley,"Regarding the syntax error, I'm not an sql guy, but I would guess you either need a semicolon at the end, or maybe the new line stuff is messing with it"
2321,2019-05-28T09:22:40.311100,Ashley,I'm thinking they might not be actual new line characters
2322,2019-05-28T10:29:54.316000,Alicia,"Hello everyone, how would you do the following in python:

• `ParentClass`: no methods, only attributes, would be better if immutable. Attributes should be visible and accessible.
• `ChildClass`: no methods, only attributes, inherit all the attributes from `ParentClass` can override parent class attributes, could have additional attributes.

At first I tried to implement this extending Enum but then I got this error ```Cannot extend enumerations```"
2322,2019-05-28T10:52:04.316300,Guillermina,"I probably don't understand what you are trying to...
Can I get a bit more context?

What's wrong with doing something like:
```
class Parent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 'px'
        self.y = 'py'

class Child(Parent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.y = 'cy'
        self.z = 'cz'

p = Parent()
c = Child()

print(vars(p))  # {'x': 'px', 'y': 'py'}
print(vars(c))  # {'x': 'px', 'y': 'cy', 'z': 'cz'}
```"
2322,2019-05-28T10:53:40.316500,Guillermina,(apart from having mutable attributes)
2322,2019-05-28T10:55:48.316700,Alicia,"HI <@Guillermina>, yeah in the end I did this way, so I am only missing the immutable part…

I was giving a look at attrs and “FrozenClass”

do you have some suggestion?"
2322,2019-05-28T10:57:19.316900,Guillermina,"what are you trying to ""freeze"", and how immutable does it have to be?
I mean... it's Python, real immutability for attributes is hard to get..."
2322,2019-05-28T10:58:22.317100,Guillermina,you could fiddle with `__setattr__` and `__delattr__` I guess...
2322,2019-05-28T11:01:20.317300,Alicia,"Ok I got what I wanted using `attrs` package.

```
import attr

@attr.s(frozen=True)
class ParentClass(object):
    attr = ""value""

```"
2322,2019-05-28T11:02:11.317500,Alicia,It’s really good because the behaviour is also inherited by child classes
2322,2019-05-28T11:07:17.317700,Guillermina,"well, in that case: say thanks to <@Chester> :taco:"

2324,2019-05-28T14:05:30.322000,Sasha,I'm not quite sure what you mean. Are you looking for `(.*?)` to get a minimal-length wildcard?
2324,2019-05-28T14:06:04.322800,Ashley,or are you looking to reference the first capture group?
2324,2019-05-28T14:06:07.322900,Jolanda,I'm looking for all between STRING and the first found condition
2324,2019-05-28T14:06:19.323300,Claudine,just reference your first capture group
2324,2019-05-28T14:06:38.323600,Ashley,capture groups are determined by parenthesis
2324,2019-05-28T14:07:04.323900,Ashley,that site provides a breakdown of your capture groups on the right
2324,2019-05-28T14:08:41.324600,Jolanda,"Got it! I was using groups in wrong way, now worked. Thanks guys"
2324,2019-05-28T14:08:49.324900,Jolanda,I have a question about this
2324,2019-05-28T14:09:53.326100,Jolanda,"the order of the CONDITION will change, so I will be create this regex for all condition, recommend some better way to do this?"
2324,2019-05-28T14:12:23.327000,Carmen,"Named capture groups. They're not standard in all regex implementations, but they're available in most of the common ones."
2325,2019-05-28T14:42:28.327100,Christina,"<@Ashley> the code isn't written by me - it's written by django, so i woud assume that it doesn't contain any syntax errors, but what do i know. in that case i should report a bug. but as it worked with postgres, I've just accepted using that instead :stuck_out_tongue:

regarding the settings, i am simply utilizing the features of the framework. The recursiveness is not a result of an action i have taken, but rather something done by the django_heroku module. `django_heroku.settings(locals())` which automatically sets the database stuff. i haven't seen the action before, and afaik it only happens in CI.

I could probably deal with a minimal example. i still get the recursive thing. that bug wasn't fixed by changing to postgres.  if i don't get any leads on the heroku support nor stack overflow i'll try an isolated test and the report it to the module and whereever else (or hopefully just solve it on my lonesome)"
2325,2019-05-28T14:42:49.327300,Christina,<@Lolita> true! :slightly_smiling_face:

2325,2019-05-28T15:22:40.333100,Claudine,it's because the `(.*)` is eating FORO
2325,2019-05-28T15:23:11.333900,Claudine,"you need `(.*?)` to make it not greedy, the `?` makes it match as few as it can instead of everything"

```
CONTRATADA(.*?)((OBJETO)|(FUNDAMENTAÇÃO LEGAL)|(FORO)|(VIGÊNCIA)|(VALOR GLOBAL)|(DOTAÇÃO ORÇAMENTÁRIA)|(DATA DA A

```"
2325,2019-05-28T15:24:12.334800,Claudine,"also you were using `|` between `CONTRATADA(.*?)|(OBJETO)`, so it was matching one or the other"
2325,2019-05-28T15:24:40.335500,Claudine,my update will match `CONTRADATA(.*?)` followed by any of the choices you provided
2325,2019-05-28T15:27:27.336500,Jolanda,"Yes, I did this approach but was wrong, I tried CONTRATADA(.*)?((...))"

2325,2019-05-28T15:27:51.337200,Claudine,`?` outside the `()` makes them optional
2325,2019-05-28T15:28:01.337500,Claudine,`?` immediately after `*` makes it non-greedy
2325,2019-05-28T15:28:08.337800,Claudine,"no problem, i love regexes"

`""cluster"" in ""some clusters do things""` would return True though.

2334,2019-05-29T05:52:29.383400,Tam,OK looks like it.
2334,2019-05-29T05:54:16.383700,Marcia,<@Malena> i’ll have a look
2335,2019-05-29T06:02:45.383800,Laurena,"Hi <@Guillermina>
i need decorator that i can use for any method inside any class"

2335,2019-05-29T06:46:26.385400,Guillermina,"Just let me see, if I understood that right:
You want to add 10 days to the current date, but if you end up on Saturday/Sunday you want to get the next Monday?
Can give an example of the problem?"
2335,2019-05-29T06:47:04.386100,Guillermina,"anyhow, you will probably be needing `datetime.weekday` (or `isoweekday`)

2335,2019-05-29T06:47:08.386400,Hiroko,You want 10 business days after the current date?
2335,2019-05-29T06:48:20.386600,Malena,I'm sure there's an algorithm for that.

2337,2019-05-29T07:04:49.387000,Jung,how to squash 2 commits in master?
2337,2019-05-29T07:09:18.388400,Jerry,then set each one to `squash`
2337,2019-05-29T07:09:39.389100,Hiroko,Why do you want to squash after a merge?
2337,2019-05-29T07:09:42.389400,Jerry,"becareful with rebase, if more ppl is using that branch it could become a mess"
2337,2019-05-29T07:09:59.390000,Hiroko,Squash us usually done with merging branches and PRs

2337,2019-05-29T07:14:09.392100,Jettie,when doing an interactive rebase you can glue a commit (or multiple commits) to another one
2337,2019-05-29T07:14:45.392900,Jettie,it's mainly done when you have a grammar mistake or something equally small and stupid :)
2337,2019-05-29T07:24:19.393200,Hiroko,the prompt is a slash command that a user here would execute.  `/howtoask` and `/justask`  are there because we get quite a few people asking to ask questions and sometimes asking them _really_ poorly
2337,2019-05-29T07:24:45.393400,Hiroko,its not an automated trigger
2337,2019-05-29T07:27:28.393600,Tam,"it is on another *workspace* I'm in, just not on this Python *workspace* I get your point"
2337,2019-05-29T07:28:48.393800,Hiroko,then that must be a custom bot added to that workspace.  we don’t have anything like that here

2339,2019-05-29T09:17:59.413700,Floy,"Greetings, no real python programmer but i need to expand some features modules. The setup: python2.7 on macOS. An Application uses the python lib JSSImporter. JSSImporter itself uses the lib python-jss (provides glue code for a application specific API). I extended python-jss to support my wanted API-Call. When i use the lib directly `python2.7` -&gt; `import jss; jss_prefs = jss.JSSPrefs(); j = jss.JSS(jss_prefs);` i can use my custom API Call an retrieve xml data `j.Patch()` for example returns xml code which i can work with via ElementTree.
After that i extended JSSImporter which init the ""Connection"" via `self.jss = jss.JSS(**kwargs)`. But this time when i call `self.jss.Patch()` i don't receive xml, instead i get a QuerySet which is not mutable.

How does this happend and how can i prevent it?"

2342,2019-05-29T12:06:37.435700,Frankie,it's a pretty well known issue on windows it seems so people just suggest downloading the wheel and installing it from that which worked fine for v 1.4.2
2342,2019-05-29T12:07:00.436300,Frankie,but I'm trying to match my reqs to the requirements.txt as closely as possible so I wanted to use v1.3.13

2342,2019-05-29T12:09:27.436800,Frankie,I'm just gonna use 1.4.2. it's all good
2342,2019-05-29T12:09:50.437000,Chester,I see

2347,2019-05-29T16:02:51.456000,Guillermina,like that: <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/comparison/comparison_with_sql.html>

Each time you create one you can not repeat the name of another. Each time the robot is reset it must give a different name. The exercise passed the excersism tests but I would like to improve it if possible to also learn.

2349,2019-05-29T20:01:01.461800,Fawn,`reset` and `create_name` can be designated as `@property`

2350,2019-05-30T00:03:48.003700,Fawn,"Well, as methods they don’t have any input parameters so why not make them properties?"
2350,2019-05-30T00:04:50.003900,Chester,"Because they represent an action, rather than an attribute."
2350,2019-05-30T00:08:03.006400,Fawn,The create_name method assigns a name to self.name which is itself an attribute to the class.

2353,2019-05-30T03:15:07.014200,Donald,can any one have a solution for this
2354,2019-05-30T03:54:44.015200,Dominique,Is there some automated way of having a methods run before and after a method implemented in a sub-class?
2354,2019-05-30T03:55:03.015700,Dominique,Something similar to common's lisp around I guess.
2354,2019-05-30T03:55:31.016200,Leida,umm you mean add the before and after after the code is written?
2354,2019-05-30T03:55:48.016600,Leida,or just add for certain methods
2354,2019-05-30T03:57:10.017900,Leida,or just nvm... you could just write a decorator that does the before and after
2354,2019-05-30T03:57:41.018400,Leida,if you can embed the before and after in the class then a decorator does the trick
2354,2019-05-30T03:58:45.019000,Dominique,"So, if I decorate the abstract method, does the decorator apply to implementations of the abstract method?"
2354,2019-05-30T04:01:52.019600,Leida,interesting question :smile: can check in repl
2354,2019-05-30T04:05:36.019900,Dominique,I'll check. That'd be convenient.
2354,2019-05-30T04:08:23.020600,Leida,if i override the abstract method then the decorator is lost too
2354,2019-05-30T04:08:42.021100,Leida,if the abstract method remains abstract then the decorator does run before and after
2354,2019-05-30T04:10:35.021600,Leida,hmm i messed up somewhere with that... ill past the repl once it works..
2354,2019-05-30T04:16:36.022500,Leida,"```from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

2354,2019-05-30T04:18:15.024000,Leida,the implementation overrides the abstract methods decorator

2354,2019-05-30T04:25:55.025400,Leida,"you could make the decorator a class method tho, so that it comes with the class..."
2354,2019-05-30T04:30:04.026600,Dominique,I may go to hell for this... `self.__class__.do_something = wrap_do_something(self.__class__.do_something)` in `__init__` of the abstract class _does it_

In Python 3.7 now you can do it this way:

  class ParentClass:
      def __init_subclass__(cls, **kwargs):
          return your_decorator(_cls=cls)
it will apply decorator for each subclass of ParentClass```"

2354,2019-05-30T04:31:07.027900,Leida,but thats whole class not method... but i think this could be extended to target fixed methods
2354,2019-05-30T04:31:20.028200,Dominique,Oh... that actually sheds light on how my solution is wrong.
2354,2019-05-30T04:31:41.028700,Dominique,I'm using Python 3.7 and this `__init_subclass__` looks very useful.

2354,2019-05-30T04:36:42.029400,Dominique,Thank you <@Leida>.
2354,2019-05-30T04:37:02.029800,Leida,indeed and the super decorates the abstract class - cool
2354,2019-05-30T04:40:12.031300,Leida,altho i might instead decorate the abstract method implicitly not through init as this calls `ABC.__init_subclass__` which might not be the best
2354,2019-05-30T04:41:30.031700,Dominique,"I'm sorry, I don't understand the last statement. Can you elaborate?"
2354,2019-05-30T04:44:26.032700,Leida,"em, i guess i dont understand the need for `super` there, you want everything along the chain of inheritance to call its init subclass?"
2354,2019-05-30T04:45:04.033500,Leida,i mistook it to decorate the original too but it wouldnt as `super()` wouldnt decorate the baseclass
2354,2019-05-30T04:49:03.034000,Leida,ill just read the docs for it as all examples i see have it :smile:
2354,2019-05-30T04:50:35.034600,Dominique,That super just makes sure I'm not accidentally removing built in __init_subclass__ functionality.

2356,2019-05-30T06:27:53.040900,Eveline,or the more pythonic one
2356,2019-05-30T06:28:10.041500,Lolita,Better use verbose syntax. So that others can easily understand it
2356,2019-05-30T06:28:25.041900,Lolita,Pythonic doesn’t mean complex oneliners
2356,2019-05-30T06:29:36.042200,Eveline,agree
2356,2019-05-30T07:01:39.051200,Ashley,"<@Eveline> In this case, since your trying to figure out whether or not this object has write access, you could make it a method or property (more or less a method that you don't have to explicitly call, so it just looks fancy), and you could reference that, which would make it more explicit. E.g.

```
if my_thing.has_write_access:
    # do some stuff
```

If the thing you're working with isn't something you control the source of, or it's a complicated class that you don't want to mess with, then you can either abstract it by creating another class that wraps instances of this one (allowing you to provide more clean and logical ways of interacting with it), or you could make another class that inherits from that class and define the method there."
2357,2019-05-30T07:34:37.051600,Arnoldo,"Hello everyone, python relative newbie here."
2357,2019-05-30T07:35:00.052300,Arnoldo,I was just curious about the approach for having constantly running apps on iot devices like raspberry pies.
2357,2019-05-30T07:35:10.052600,Arnoldo,There are 2 approaches from what i have been reading.
2357,2019-05-30T07:35:16.052900,Arnoldo,starting as a daemon
2357,2019-05-30T07:35:30.053300,Arnoldo,and then the while true loop to make it run forever
2357,2019-05-30T07:35:38.053600,Arnoldo,to me the while true approach seems a bit hacky
2357,2019-05-30T07:36:03.054200,Arnoldo,im curious to hear from you guys what you think.
2357,2019-05-30T07:41:21.057800,Lolita,"&gt; starting as a daemon
I’m not much familiar with raspberry pi, but if it’s an option, it’s the best one. Although, I don’t think there’s anything hacky in a while loop. In my opinion it’s the best and cleanest loop you could use in this scenario. The daemons are most probably instructions running in a while loop."
2357,2019-05-30T07:42:03.058200,Arnoldo,i see. thank you <@Lolita>
2357,2019-05-30T07:42:33.058800,Arnoldo,So it will not stress out the computer to have an endless loop running on the pi like that?
2357,2019-05-30T07:42:42.059100,Arnoldo,i'm thinking too much like a human i guess :slightly_smiling_face:
2357,2019-05-30T07:43:11.059600,Arnoldo,i figured a daemon would give it a rest in between queries.
2357,2019-05-30T07:45:59.062400,Lolita,"You need to make sure that the loop is not adding a lot of data in a data structure or a variable without cleaning it. If possible, if possible, make it an IO driven loop, so that it doesn’t waste resources."
2357,2019-05-30T07:46:32.062800,Arnoldo,"ok very smart, i don't know about io driven loops but i will take a look at all that."
2357,2019-05-30T07:46:40.063200,Arnoldo,What do you do python and work wise?
2357,2019-05-30T07:47:04.063700,Lolita,means it will wait for a triger point instead of looping continously
2357,2019-05-30T07:47:25.064100,Lolita,I’m working in a WebDev company Niteo.
2357,2019-05-30T07:48:03.064300,Arnoldo,that's awesome
2357,2019-05-30T07:48:12.064600,Arnoldo,ok where are they based?
2357,2019-05-30T07:48:25.065000,Arnoldo,you mostly do python?
2357,2019-05-30T07:48:46.065400,Lolita,Slovenia. It’s focused on Python. <https://niteo.co>
2357,2019-05-30T07:49:43.065700,Arnoldo,very nice

Does the schema make sense?

I have successfully done simple CRUD operations, but struggling with inserting new data (Like a new message) into an existing document without overwriting whats already there. Anyone know how? Maybe I'm approaching this wrong?"
2358,2019-05-30T08:55:32.071300,Conchita,"My goal is to have for each `threadID`, one unique document. Where new messages are added into that document"
2358,2019-05-30T08:56:08.072100,Conchita,"Or, should I create a sub-collection for each `threadID` and store messages as documents?"
2358,2019-05-30T09:01:12.072300,Bethany,Probably want a collection
2358,2019-05-30T09:05:48.074000,Conchita,"The simplest thing would be to have each `threadID` as a collection at the root level. If I'd do that, there will be thousands of collections at the root level quickly however. Is that a bad thing?"
2358,2019-05-30T09:07:31.075600,Leida,how deep you nest stuff wont make much difference if the amount of data is the same
2358,2019-05-30T09:07:49.076000,Conchita,Another alternative would be `rooms/tech_team/threadID` where `rooms` and `threadID` would be collections
2358,2019-05-30T09:07:55.076200,Conchita,"Ok, so go with simple then <@Leida>"
2358,2019-05-30T09:08:10.076800,Conchita,Same amount of data either way
2358,2019-05-30T09:08:11.077000,Leida,"yeah, go as complex as you absolutely need, but no more"
2358,2019-05-30T09:08:35.077700,Leida,makes addressing the data simpler in your program
2358,2019-05-30T09:08:53.078400,Bethany,Can you use relational?

2358,2019-05-30T09:11:25.080600,Conchita,How do I measure that?
2358,2019-05-30T09:11:40.081400,Conchita,"No data exists, new product"
2358,2019-05-30T09:11:51.081800,Bethany,"Like is this dozens, thousands, millions or billions"
2358,2019-05-30T09:12:04.082100,Conchita,tens of thousands
2358,2019-05-30T09:12:35.082900,Bethany,So ill delegate to the more experienced folks about tech decisions like this in an early stage
2358,2019-05-30T09:13:02.083800,Bethany,But what I can say is it's really annoying as a data scientist dealing with random heirarchical structures
2358,2019-05-30T09:13:40.084400,Bethany,Since usually we look at data in ways the engineer didn't expect
2358,2019-05-30T09:13:59.084900,Bethany,Which is what relational db is designed to do
2358,2019-05-30T09:15:10.085600,Bethany,Example: get all messages grouped by users where they live in NA
2358,2019-05-30T09:16:29.085900,Conchita,I do get your point
2358,2019-05-30T09:16:48.086300,Conchita,Maybe I should cross this over with the team a couple more times
2358,2019-05-30T09:17:18.086900,Bethany,Just make sure you know the tradeoff
2358,2019-05-30T09:17:43.087200,Conchita,Yep
2358,2019-05-30T09:18:06.088200,Bethany,I believe nosql is much faster inserts at large scale
2358,2019-05-30T09:18:13.088500,Conchita,I'll set up some quick schema now and populate it with some simulated data and discuss with the team tomorrow

2358,2019-05-30T09:20:40.091600,Conchita,The need for a db is more to be able to connect messages in the same conversation with each other. But it could grow into something bigger further down the path

<@Genesis> i'm pretty sure the `reset` function almost always fails"
2359,2019-05-30T09:41:37.096700,Jorge,"its because `self.create_name() == self.name` is almost never *True*, so the code inside the *while* block almost never gets executed. you'd have to have the name generation code in `create_name` create the same name as it originally did, which would happen every 26*26*999 times (about 1 in 500, 000)"

2363,2019-05-30T12:23:54.107200,Mi,Thanks a lot!!!
2364,2019-05-30T12:46:20.107600,Rolando,Hey quick question
2364,2019-05-30T12:47:27.108800,Rolando,"What happens if a i have and operator in an if for example
```if 'collector' not in keys and row['collector']:
``` if the first is false, does it evaluates the next condition ?"
2364,2019-05-30T12:47:59.109400,Rolando,or it will jump to the next line because the statement wont be true due to the first condition being False?
2364,2019-05-30T12:48:56.110300,Sasha,"The `and` and `or` operators will indeed short-circuit, so the second clause wouldn't be evaluated."
2364,2019-05-30T12:49:00.110400,Mayra,"The left clause will be evaluated first, and then the right one only if the first one is False"
2364,2019-05-30T12:49:29.110700,Rolando,"Cool thats what i thought, thanks guys"
2364,2019-05-30T12:54:41.111600,Raguel,and if we put parans around `if 'collector' not in (keys and row['collector']):`?
2364,2019-05-30T13:01:47.113800,Sasha,"That's a little weird. If `keys` is non-empty, it would check if `'collector'` was in `keys`. If `keys` is empty, it would check if `'collector'` was in `row['collector']`. But it won't check if it's in both, as you might expect from English grammar. (Edit: this is wrong, see below.)"
2364,2019-05-30T13:04:12.114000,Rolando,yes i didnt met not in
2364,2019-05-30T13:04:13.114300,Rolando,ment in
2364,2019-05-30T13:04:27.114700,Rolando,but the real question was about the evaluation if the first one was false
2364,2019-05-30T13:13:14.115000,Raguel,was feeling blank that would be printed so just started checking what gets printed
2364,2019-05-30T13:19:44.116100,Sasha,"Actually what I said above was for `or` logic, so I got it wrong, oops."
2364,2019-05-30T13:23:43.117500,Raguel,"so it goes like this that if it is `(True or False)`, it will evaluate to `True` and so on, right?"
2365,2019-05-30T16:52:53.120400,Brain,"`if 'this' in (a and b):` doesn’t look right to me if `a` and `b` are lists
```
&gt;&gt;&gt; ['this', 'that', 'thee'] and ['no', 'not', 'nope']
['no', 'not', 'nope']
```"
2365,2019-05-30T17:01:00.121200,Ashley,"<@Brain> that's because it won't work. The `and` operator in this case is leveraging ""truthiness"""
2365,2019-05-30T17:01:22.121700,Ashley,"basically, `a` is considered ""truthy"", so it moves on to `b`"
2365,2019-05-30T17:01:43.122200,Ashley,"because `b` is also ""truthy"", the whole statement evaluates to `b`"
2365,2019-05-30T17:01:54.122400,Ashley,e.g.
2365,2019-05-30T17:02:01.122700,Ashley,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3] and [4,5,6]
[4, 5, 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
```"
2365,2019-05-30T17:02:21.123000,Ashley,it's kind of the opposite of a shortcircuit
2365,2019-05-30T17:02:31.123300,Ashley,"if you look at the `or` operator, it has similar logic"
2365,2019-05-30T17:02:48.123700,Ashley,"but stops at the first ""truthy"" thing and just evaluates to that"
2365,2019-05-30T17:03:04.124100,Ashley,e.g.
2365,2019-05-30T17:03:12.124400,Ashley,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3] or [4,5,6]
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
```"
2365,2019-05-30T17:03:56.125100,Ashley,"basically, whichever thing in the comparison answers the ""question"" is what the comparison resolves to"
2365,2019-05-30T17:04:04.125400,Ashley,for example
2365,2019-05-30T17:04:12.125700,Ashley,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; False and [1,2,3]
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
```"
2365,2019-05-30T17:04:35.126100,Ashley,"```
&gt;&gt;&gt; [] and [1,2,3]
[]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
```"
2365,2019-05-30T17:05:02.127000,Ashley,"it really doesn't care about the `[1,2,3]` in the last two examples, because it already knew the answer to the ""question"" after looking at the first thing"
2365,2019-05-30T17:05:35.128500,Hiroko,you;d need to do two separate `in` evaluations
2365,2019-05-30T17:05:50.129400,Hiroko,"you can’t say “hey, for this one thing, I want you to look in two lists at once”"
2365,2019-05-30T17:06:06.130300,Brain,"well I wouldn’t say this won’t work.
For example, `&gt;&gt;&gt; 'this' in (True and ['this', 'that'])` will work, but I wouldn’t approve such PR :smile:"
2365,2019-05-30T17:06:12.130600,Ashley,"it works out in an actual `if` statement, because whichever it resolves to will also be evaluated based on its truthiness"
2365,2019-05-30T17:07:05.131900,Ashley,"<@Brain> the reason that works is because `(True and ['this', 'that'])` evaluates to just `['this', 'that']`"
2365,2019-05-30T17:07:10.132200,Ashley,the `True and` is moot
2365,2019-05-30T17:07:31.132600,Brain,"Salmon, that wasn’t me who asked the question"
2365,2019-05-30T17:07:55.133100,Brain,I just mentioned that `if 'this' in (a and b):` doesn’t look right
2365,2019-05-30T17:07:55.133200,Ashley,oh woops :joy:
2365,2019-05-30T17:08:10.133500,Ashley,<@Raguel> read above for the explanation
2365,2019-05-30T17:08:22.133900,Raguel,:eyes:
2365,2019-05-30T17:08:39.134300,Ashley,"you can also do `if 'this' in (*a, *b):`"
2365,2019-05-30T17:11:32.135400,Raguel,I was just trying to wrap my head around truthiness actually by trying different combinations
2365,2019-05-30T17:18:03.135900,Ashley,There's a list of things that are considered falsey somewhere
2365,2019-05-30T17:18:14.136300,Ashley,Pretty much everything else is considered truthy
2365,2019-05-30T18:30:09.137500,Ashley,"Because the first thing didn't fully answer the question. Both have to be truthy, so if the first one was truthy, then the only thing that matters is the 2nd thing"
2365,2019-05-30T18:30:45.137700,Ashley,"If the 2nd thing is truthy, then that fully answers the question"
2365,2019-05-30T18:45:11.139900,Priscilla,"So I learned something new in class, apparently comparing floats in java is a no-no using &gt;==&lt; operators is this true in python even if the float is only one decimal place? like `x &lt;= 16.5`?"
2366,2019-05-30T17:06:11.130500,Nicky,"Hi — I am wondering if someone can explain how to create an empty base python virtual environment for a Heroku deployment.  If I do something like `conda create --name empty_env python=3.7` it wants to install quite a few packages (`ca-certificates`, `sqlite`, etc.).  How can I be sure my new environment only has what it needs?  Thanks!"
2367,2019-05-30T17:44:43.136700,Raguel,still not sure why this evaluates to latter here?
2367,2019-05-30T17:45:19.136900,Raguel,"and if we do `['this', 'that'] and True`, it evaluates to `True`"
2368,2019-05-30T18:50:17.140800,Hiroko,<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0485/>
2368,2019-05-30T18:51:04.141100,Sasha,"I'm not sure what the Java warning is about, but floats can be inherently weird at edge cases:
```&gt;&gt;&gt; 0.2 == 2 * 0.1
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 0.3 == 3 * 0.1
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 0.3 &lt; 3 * 0.1
True```"
2368,2019-05-30T18:52:24.141500,Sasha,"Under the hood:
```&gt;&gt;&gt; 0.2
0.20000000000000001
&gt;&gt;&gt; 0.3
0.29999999999999999```"
2368,2019-05-30T18:52:51.141900,Hiroko,that’s why PEP485 added a few things to python 3.5
2368,2019-05-30T18:53:21.142800,Hiroko,and thats why `assertAlmostEqual` is part of the unittest lib
2368,2019-05-30T18:53:29.142900,Priscilla,great link <@Hiroko> thank you!
2369,2019-05-30T19:23:05.143000,Ashely,Just saw this.  Did you make any headway?
2369,2019-05-30T19:24:43.143200,Ashely,I'm thinking my best chance for success is going to be preformatting/parsing before it goes in.  Flatten it a bit so it can be accessed easier as a DB object.
2369,2019-05-30T19:25:25.143400,Ashely,"Not a magical stroke of python genius, but closer to what I do for a living anyway"
2369,2019-05-30T19:31:11.144900,Raguel,Ah makes sense. Forgot I was using `and`!
2369,2019-05-30T19:34:50.146700,Priscilla,"So I am not seeing a way to compare a float to 2 other floats, like making sure that x is between 13.1 and 16.5 right now I am doing this. Do you think I should find the number in between and make the tolerance span the whole tolerance?"
2369,2019-05-30T19:41:17.152000,Bethany,Anytime you're comparing float equality you should have a tolerance such that `abs(x - y) &lt; tol`
2369,2019-05-30T19:41:45.152700,Bethany,"However in your case it might be reasonable to not do that, as you're checking if your value is within a range"
2369,2019-05-30T19:42:27.153700,Bethany,"Depending on your domain, does it matter if you're wrong within 1e-15 of the edge?"
2369,2019-05-30T19:44:09.155800,Priscilla,hmm that wasnt defined in the specs I was given.
2369,2019-05-30T19:45:03.157000,Priscilla,the only thing they said was the measured value must be between 13.1 and 16.5 vDC
2369,2019-05-30T19:45:31.157500,Priscilla,so I dont think its bad if its wrong within 1e-15

        |-- __init__.py
        `-- rows

            |   `-- panels
            |       `-- __init__.py
            |-- HealthCheck
            |   `-- panels

            |   `-- panels
            |       `-- __init__.py

Now my question is, how can I import all py files from top .py (CustomMetrics-DEV.py) recursively. I need to do this because I pass objects from sub .py files to parent ones. They are nested. I made it this way because I wanted it to be modular. I couldn't find a relevant question on the internet."

2375,2019-05-31T09:39:21.194800,Nigel,"<@Nisha> It really depends. If your package will be used by a very tiny amout of configurations, like one known Linux distro/macos/windows then it's probably worth prebuilding and vendoring. If you don't know exact userbase and their target OSes then I think you have to provide a facility of building extensions upon installation"
2375,2019-05-31T09:40:12.195300,Nigel,And it also depends on whether target OS will have compiler on it
2375,2019-05-31T09:41:30.196500,Nisha,"<@Nigel> very interesting! Upon installation would actually be our best bet here, as the dependencies are handled by `conan`. If you’ve got any links handy to share, I’d greatly appreciate it."

2380,2019-05-31T10:50:09.215000,Hiroko,so how do you expect this to change in the context of a loop and sleep?

2380,2019-05-31T10:56:44.219400,Hiroko,could it be the language?
2380,2019-05-31T10:57:06.219900,Hiroko,wonder if they grade the performance by the same metric regardless of language
2380,2019-05-31T10:57:34.220500,Conrad,"I'm not sure, I've never faced a situation so far that I would be failed based on the choice of language"

2380,2019-05-31T10:59:06.222200,Conrad,ok I wasn't able to understand that at first glance
2380,2019-05-31T10:59:32.223000,Conrad,"so they mean 100,000 '(', followed by 100,000 ')' follow by ')('"

2380,2019-05-31T11:00:03.223400,Clemmie,followed by a bad
2380,2019-05-31T11:01:54.224300,Conrad,"indeed, it takes ~7s on my machine"
2380,2019-05-31T11:01:56.224500,Conrad,bah
2380,2019-05-31T11:02:28.224700,Clemmie,I think there are a few things you can do
2380,2019-05-31T11:03:01.225300,Clemmie,don’t use is_empty in your loop evaluation - catch the indexerror and break out
2380,2019-05-31T11:03:43.226500,Conrad,ah
2380,2019-05-31T11:03:51.227000,Conrad,"I get you. so at the first sign of trouble, end the program right there"
2380,2019-05-31T11:03:54.227100,Clemmie,"also don’t peek - if you pop out an item from the stack that is in your map and is not the partner of the current char, error out"
2380,2019-05-31T11:04:45.227500,Conrad,okay but how does that work for this case. I would still have to iterate over 200K parentheses
2380,2019-05-31T11:05:34.228400,Clemmie,"might be ok, because you aren’t doing a list lookup and comparison each time, just the comparison"
2380,2019-05-31T11:05:56.228800,Clemmie,"and if it is still not fast enough, you look for other efficiencies"
2380,2019-05-31T11:06:20.229100,Conrad,hmmm
2380,2019-05-31T11:06:26.229300,Conrad,lol and they marked this problem as painless/easy
2380,2019-05-31T11:07:03.229700,Conrad,another optimization I can think of is to return 0 if the length of the string is not even
2380,2019-05-31T11:10:42.230200,Clemmie,won’t that fail the nested string requirement?
2380,2019-05-31T11:13:27.231000,Sasha,I think a big optimization would be to work from the end of the list instead of inserting and popping at element 0... that causes Python to need to shift every element in the list with every access.
2380,2019-05-31T11:14:46.231200,Conrad,"how can the string be a proper nested string if the length of the string is not even? for every left parenthesis there has to be a right parenthesis. this check by itself is not sufficient, but it would work as an optimization"
2380,2019-05-31T11:15:04.231600,Conrad,so insert at the end and remove at the end?
2380,2019-05-31T11:15:25.231800,Conrad,I had not thought of this
2380,2019-05-31T11:15:30.232000,Conrad,makes sense
2380,2019-05-31T11:18:23.232100,Clemmie,"`('a')` is a properly nested string, odd length"
2380,2019-05-31T11:19:43.232800,Conrad,"now I'm failing two different performance tests, this time due to wrong answer, not timeout :joy:"
2380,2019-05-31T11:19:58.233200,Conrad,thanks <@Sasha> <@Clemmie> :taco: I should be able to take it from here
2380,2019-05-31T11:20:07.233300,Clemmie,unless I misunderstand “S has the form “(U)” or “[U]” or “{U}” where U is a properly nested string;”
2380,2019-05-31T11:23:09.233900,Conrad,the only characters in the string are parentheses

- A. You are importing a file (i.e. module) `accounts_app.py` from the `accounts/views/` directory?
- B. You are importing a function named `accounts_app` from a `accounts/views.py` file?
- C. You are importing a variable named `accounts_app` from a `accounts/views.py` file?"

2381,2019-05-31T12:28:54.249400,Jorge,"i have a detached tmux session running some code in ipython
is it ok to edit the underlying code that the tmux session is referencing?
I'm guessing what my ipython shell is using is some compiled bytecode version of my source, but I'm not 100% sure"
2381,2019-05-31T12:29:13.249600,Clemmie,all three of those imports are equivalent from an import syntax point of view
2381,2019-05-31T12:29:44.250100,Clemmie,<@Jorge> you mean you want the session to keep using old code while you edit the code itself?
2381,2019-05-31T12:30:25.250700,Jorge,yea. its updating some things using `./manage.py shell`
2381,2019-05-31T12:32:23.252200,Clemmie,I'm pretty sure it depends what shell you are using. iPython (i think) will hot-reload code. the standard repl won't
2381,2019-05-31T12:33:05.252300,Chester,"Regarding your question: there’s no definitive way to know beforehand.
But usually you can guess depending on the name. Like in `from something import models`, `models` will most likely be a module.
`from something import parse_stuff` - `parse_stuff` is likely a callable. And so on."
2381,2019-05-31T12:34:39.253000,Jorge,"ah, yea it looks like autoreload is something that can be configured in ipython, so i'll have to check that out"

2383,2019-05-31T13:35:30.264900,Maricruz,i don't think you can initialize multiple objects with `arr = [[]]*9` as that makes them all the same array

2384,2019-05-31T14:41:10.274200,Ashley,<@Dennise> are you saying you want something to run immediately upon installing via `pip`? or that you want your package to provide a command that can be run from the CLI (much like installing `pytest` lets me run the `pytest` command)?

2384,2019-05-31T14:56:30.277400,Ashley,the setup.cfg is basically default values for command line arguments provided when installing a package

2402,2019-06-01T08:28:40.325900,Ashley,<@Roxie> please use code snippets. It does syntax highlighting and makes it easier to read
2402,2019-06-01T08:29:43.327400,Hiroko,Or triple back ticks
2402,2019-06-01T08:31:35.329600,Ashley,Snippets are also collapsible so they don't dominate chat
2402,2019-06-01T08:31:40.329700,Roxie,None
2402,2019-06-01T08:32:02.330500,Ashley,(very useful for those on mobile :wink: )
2402,2019-06-01T08:32:03.330600,Roxie,This is fine now?
2402,2019-06-01T08:32:12.330800,Ashley,"Yeah, thanks"
2402,2019-06-01T08:32:19.331100,Roxie,Yup I can understand
2402,2019-06-01T08:34:23.333400,Ashley,"<@Lanelle> think about counting. We use base-10 for our number system, which means we have 10 characters to represent different numbers. We start with 0 and increment until we reach 9. What is the next thing we do, now that we've run out of characters? We ""carry the 1"" and start on the next number place with `10`. Notice how we have a 1 in the tens place and a 0 in the ones place. This is because we have 1 ten and 0 ones. We started over with the ones and looped back around to zero"
2402,2019-06-01T08:35:21.335100,Ashley,"Binary works the same way. It's just a base-2 system, so there's only 2 number characters, and the number places are exponents of 2 instead of 10 (e.g. the ones place, the twos place, the fours place)"
2402,2019-06-01T08:36:56.336600,Ashley,"If I wanted all the permutations of base-10 numbers that go up to 999, I would just start counting at 000"
2402,2019-06-01T08:37:36.337500,Ashley,"The trick is that the characters I use to represent the numbers doesn't actually matter, so long as they're consistent"
2402,2019-06-01T08:43:36.340700,Ashley,"<@Roxie> so it looks like you're trying to scrape YouTube comments. Selenium is actually a very bad scraping tool. It's an abstraction around the WebDriver protocol, which is meant for automated testing that simulates user behavior.  YouTube actually has an API that you can make web requests to directly to get comments and comment threads from a video. I highly recommend you use that instead"
2402,2019-06-01T09:17:22.342100,Roxie,<@Ashley> Yeah I tried API also I'm not sure about where the replies lies. I have scraped the comments with API. Will share the snippet now
2403,2019-06-01T09:31:57.342400,Carmen,You're looking for comment threads. <https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/commentThreads>

2403,2019-06-01T09:47:50.345100,Roxie,Yeah exactly what method I need to apply for this ? comments.list ?
2403,2019-06-01T09:48:05.345500,Roxie,How to define that in my snippet
2403,2019-06-01T10:16:19.346000,Roxie,"I have taken the reply count with

replies = item[""snippet""][""totalReplyCount""]"
2403,2019-06-01T10:16:48.346700,Roxie,I'm not sure about the reply content can anyone suggest me with that
2403,2019-06-01T10:40:29.346900,Hiroko,"&gt;&gt;&gt; The replies object is a container that contains a list of replies to the comment, if any exist. The replies.comments property represents the list of comments itself."
2404,2019-06-01T10:40:45.347400,Hiroko,It’s right there in the documentation 
2404,2019-06-01T10:41:53.348200,Hiroko,Look at the json structure of the response 
2405,2019-06-01T11:16:28.348300,Jennell,"Yeah, 4pm for me sounds good. That can give us a few hours together each day."
2406,2019-06-01T11:44:12.348700,Eugenio,can poetry ensure i have the correct python version?
2406,2019-06-01T11:44:21.348900,Eugenio,or is it only for package versions?
2406,2019-06-01T11:45:23.349000,Chester,"You have to specify the supported python versions range (or a specific one), and it won’t install on an unsupported python"
2406,2019-06-01T11:46:01.349200,Eugenio,"so it wont handle installing one, but you can define the version as a dependency?"
2406,2019-06-01T11:46:23.349400,Chester,"Oh, it won’t install pythons for you"
2406,2019-06-01T11:46:32.349600,Chester,`pyenv` does the job though
2406,2019-06-01T11:47:16.349800,Eugenio,im on windows and just looking to make sure if someone downloads something i did in python they can install the packages and ensure they have the correct python version
2406,2019-06-01T11:47:26.350000,Eugenio,so i guess a combination of poetry and pyenv is all i need?
2406,2019-06-01T11:48:00.350200,Chester,pyenv doesn’t work on windows afaik
2406,2019-06-01T11:48:17.350400,Chester,but it’s not really needed because the system does not depend on any particular python version
2406,2019-06-01T11:48:48.350600,Chester,you can install multiple pythons from nuget/chocolatey/python.org site without a hassle
2406,2019-06-01T11:49:28.350800,Eugenio,"how do you manage which python is ""active"" though?"
2406,2019-06-01T11:50:28.351200,Chester,"In windows, you have to be explicit. There’s also `py.exe` wrapper that allows you to select the desired version ad hoc"
2406,2019-06-01T11:50:40.351400,Chester,"I’m not sure if poetry works on windows, but you can check easily"
2406,2019-06-01T11:50:50.351600,Eugenio,oh
2406,2019-06-01T11:51:10.351800,Eugenio,"the command runs at least, i was just about to try it out"
2406,2019-06-01T11:52:14.352000,Eugenio,"""Poetry requires Python 2.7 or 3.4+. It is multi-platform and the goal is to make it work equally well on Windows, Linux and OSX."""
2406,2019-06-01T11:54:22.352200,Chester,Ok great
2406,2019-06-01T11:57:41.352400,Jimmy,on windows you might want to install python from the store
2406,2019-06-01T11:57:46.352600,Jimmy,it's probably a lot easier
2406,2019-06-01T12:12:40.353200,Eugenio,"ah nice, didnt know about that"
2406,2019-06-01T12:15:44.353400,Eugenio,"actually if you try to run python from the commandline, if its not available it'll automatically open up the store page for python"
2406,2019-06-01T13:40:50.354800,Lanelle,"print([(a, b, c) for a in 'abc' for b in 'abc' for c in 'abc'])
any way of making this more generic for each word. i want to have a function that takes a word and does the above"
2406,2019-06-01T14:16:01.355700,Raven,If you break it out of being a one-liner you'll probably find a way to adapt it
2406,2019-06-01T14:18:43.356000,Lanelle,"<@Raven> ```&gt;&gt;&gt; for a in 'abc':
...     for b in 'abc':
...         for c in 'abc':
...             print(a,b,c)
...```"
2406,2019-06-01T14:19:14.356400,Raven,"Right, so you can see that you've repeated something... so factor that out to a variable"
2406,2019-06-01T14:19:43.357000,Raven,"You can look at each part of the code, see where you've 'hard-coded' something, and refactor it to be based on the input instead"
2406,2019-06-01T14:20:59.357200,Lanelle,"```&gt;&gt;&gt; word='evening'
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in word:

2406,2019-06-01T14:21:14.357600,Lanelle,it works but only 3 letters are getting printed
2406,2019-06-01T14:21:23.357900,Raven,"Sure, because you've hard-coded 3 loops"
2406,2019-06-01T14:21:32.358100,Lanelle,how can i have n loops
2406,2019-06-01T14:21:45.358400,Raven,Put the loops inside another loop from 1 to N
2406,2019-06-01T14:23:57.359300,Lanelle,i didnt get that..
2406,2019-06-01T14:24:55.359500,Raven,"You want to iterate over all the possible 'digits', for all the possible 'positions'. There are 7 positions in 'evening', and 7 digits (if you allow duplicates). So you can go from there"
2406,2019-06-01T14:25:31.359900,Lanelle,hmmm
2406,2019-06-01T14:29:04.360500,Lanelle,<@Raven> any snippets that you can share please?
2406,2019-06-01T14:32:32.361000,Raven,Sadly not. This isn't the sort of thing most people will code themselves when there are tools for it in the standard library
2406,2019-06-01T14:36:40.361100,Charisse,"Ok, confirmed it works for me"
2406,2019-06-01T14:46:19.361500,Charisse,"Also I’ve created a calendar invite.  If you want to be on it, DM me your email"

2408,2019-06-01T13:04:12.353800,Lanelle,any snippets to start?
2409,2019-06-01T14:37:08.361300,Charisse,How do you normally do this?  tmate?  Or do you have a zoom?
2410,2019-06-01T15:59:29.363100,Carmen,"<@Lanelle>: To execute a loop from 1 to N, you do this:
```for i in range(N):

2413,2019-06-02T08:04:17.369800,Christina,"sounds interesting :slightly_smiling_face: If you have a specific question, then it is easier to solve that. are you asking for ressources on doing web queries? on the linkage after findng the list of industries? :slightly_smiling_face: or just general advice on your problem? websites where the company -&gt; industry information might be accessible?"
2413,2019-06-02T08:05:12.370000,Christina,by googling `pyspark visual studio` i found: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/set-up-pyspark-interactive-environment> - did that help you?
2413,2019-06-02T08:07:58.370300,Christina,"I don't think i fully understand your question. So you have an html form? on what website? pointing to what site? ""contact form"" is rather abstract. if you can change the HTML on the contact form, you can simply make it into a form and make a POST (or get) request pointing at a django view, which handles the arguments and does what ever your contact form should do :slightly_smiling_face:"

2416,2019-06-02T13:20:34.378400,Jettie,pseudocode?
2417,2019-06-02T13:57:28.379200,Corina,Maybe try the Google Places API?
2418,2019-06-02T14:26:42.380200,Ashley,<@Elwanda> you could try wiping out the install and reinstalling it.
2418,2019-06-02T14:26:55.380700,Ashley,"Beyond that, I have no idea though"
2418,2019-06-02T14:27:50.380900,Christina,or as we you to call it: :cry: :cry:
2418,2019-06-02T14:32:52.382600,Marth,"<@Serita> columns have a ""difference"" method.  I'd think that'll do what you need. `df1.columns.difference(df2.columns)`"

2419,2019-06-02T16:27:57.383200,Serita,if there is a way?
2420,2019-06-02T17:55:05.384300,Taneka,"Hey guys, new here and new to python. I installed Python3 on my mac. But my editor isnt recognizing it."
2420,2019-06-02T18:02:27.384900,Hiroko,have you configured your editor to point to the new executable?
2420,2019-06-02T18:02:39.385200,Nigel,"Also, what is your editor?"
2420,2019-06-02T18:03:05.385700,Nigel,"And what exactly ""isnt recognizing it"" means?"
2420,2019-06-02T18:03:39.386000,Taneka,using pycharm
2420,2019-06-02T18:04:04.386300,Taneka,at the bottom it says 2.7 as interpreter
2420,2019-06-02T18:05:44.386400,Taneka,None
2420,2019-06-02T18:05:57.386900,Taneka,its not letting me click okay to change it
2420,2019-06-02T18:06:54.387600,Nigel,"I see at least two python3 enterpreters in the list. Maybe pycharm doesn't allow you to click ""ok"" because just selecting an interpreter is not enough?"
2420,2019-06-02T18:10:32.388200,Taneka,I ended up just creating a new project and initializing with py3
2420,2019-06-02T18:10:45.388600,Taneka,my file is called app.py
2420,2019-06-02T18:11:09.389000,Taneka,when I run `python app.py` it works
2420,2019-06-02T18:11:26.389400,Taneka,but when I run `python3 app.py`
2420,2019-06-02T18:11:30.389600,Taneka,I get ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘requests’
2420,2019-06-02T18:13:27.390100,Taneka,I have `import requests` so somehow that package is not available for python3 ?
2420,2019-06-02T18:14:32.390700,Mildred,have you pip installed it for python3?
2420,2019-06-02T18:14:49.391200,Taneka,do I need to install separate for each version?
2420,2019-06-02T18:15:29.392200,Taneka,how do I do that?
2420,2019-06-02T18:16:05.392900,Mildred,"you might need to install pip for python3

I think on linux it was something like apt-get install python3_pip"
2420,2019-06-02T18:16:18.393400,Mildred,and then you use it like normal but as pip3
2420,2019-06-02T18:16:41.394000,Mildred,"i dont use a mac though, so i cant be more specific for you"
2420,2019-06-02T18:16:49.394200,Nigel,"<@Taneka> Yes, you do. Check the virtualenv tutorial: <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments>

And virtualenv docs: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>"
2420,2019-06-02T18:18:46.394500,Taneka,sweet thanks guys!
2420,2019-06-02T18:18:58.394800,Taneka,What would you recommend for importing csv and creating csv
2420,2019-06-02T18:20:16.395600,Nigel,"Python has built in module called `csv`: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html>

for more advanced use there's also `pandas`: <http://pandas.pydata.org/>"
2420,2019-06-02T18:20:51.396100,Nigel,"Pandas is super-duper cool, I wish I studied it earlier in my life :harold:"
2420,2019-06-02T18:22:23.396700,Taneka,hmm seems like way beyond my use
2420,2019-06-02T18:22:33.397100,Taneka,isnt there some simple package you would recommend
2420,2019-06-02T18:22:45.397600,Bethany,"+1 for pandas, it only takes a day or so of learning for it to be useful"
2420,2019-06-02T18:24:40.398400,Nigel,"I agree, it's quite easy to start working with it"
2420,2019-06-02T18:24:45.398700,Bethany,But for simple stuff just go with csv
2420,2019-06-02T18:25:09.399400,Bethany,But if you're new to python maybe pandas is easier
2420,2019-06-02T18:25:56.399800,Nigel,There is also a cool repo with exercises: <https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises>
2420,2019-06-02T18:26:18.400200,Nigel,And tons of tutorials online

2420,2019-06-02T18:32:20.404100,Bethany,Ok that was supposed to be a block but I'm on a phone and don't know why
2420,2019-06-02T18:32:41.404300,Taneka,well that is what errors

2420,2019-06-02T18:48:01.405700,Taneka,any overall tips on getting good with python? coming from ruby and some JS
2420,2019-06-02T18:52:59.406800,Bethany,If you know ruby and js already it's honestly just a matter of getting used to python idioms and whatnot
2420,2019-06-02T18:56:49.408800,Bethany,"There's a whole scientific and numeric stack that's unique to python, if that interests you it's quite a bit different. Last I heard it's roughly 50% of python use"

2420,2019-06-02T19:07:29.410100,Hiroko,"ryby seems to like implicitness, whereas python is explicit"
2420,2019-06-02T19:08:01.410600,Bethany,That's my impression as well when I did ruby for a weekend
2421,2019-06-02T20:42:21.410900,Marth,<@Serita> `insert` does that.  <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.insert.html>
2422,2019-06-02T22:24:36.411200,Starla,"Hi Guys,
Do u know how to write code in Python to multly dataset in .csv?"
2422,2019-06-02T22:24:36.411300,Starla,Multiply*
2423,2019-06-03T00:04:49.411400,Hsiu,Can you clarify what you mean by “multiply a dataset”? I gather you don’t mean duplicate the rows or columns. Perhaps you mean multiply column A by column B into column C?
2424,2019-06-03T02:09:58.414400,Leora,Anyone have any good places or processes to learn about decorators? I get the high level concept and have used @x.setter. Looking for resources/best practices on good place to start using them.
2424,2019-06-03T02:12:15.414600,Mildred,"im in the same boat.

I kinda get the idea, but no firm grasp of really when to use them (except flask, i get it for routes)"
2424,2019-06-03T02:16:55.414800,Chester,"<https://www.google.com/search?q=python+decorators>
&gt; About 3,130,000 results"
2424,2019-06-03T02:27:47.415300,Leora,<@Chester>: I've done that and will continue to do that. This was a question for people who may have been in a similar position and see if they had a preferred place to go look. Good to know Google is always a backup though.
2424,2019-06-03T02:29:54.415500,Chester,"My point is that there are literally millions of articles and books about python in general, and decorators in specific. They are roughly the same because they describe the same concept.
They differ only in wording, and you can pick your favorite one just by looking at the first google search results page."
2425,2019-06-03T03:03:12.415900,Conchita,I think its 100% fair to ask for recommend sources on a specific topic
2425,2019-06-03T03:04:11.416100,Conchita,"With ""millions of resources"" a lot of it will be mediocre"
2425,2019-06-03T03:05:43.416300,Chester,"What about trying to read something, literally anything, first, then ask to clarify if the article is not clear?
This is highly subjective, and doesn’t differ much from asking to write some code for them."
2425,2019-06-03T03:05:57.416500,Conchita,"<@Leora> I'm also in your same position reg decorators, so can't vouch for these specifically but every time I watch a Corey Schafer on a complex topic I feel I get the basics"
2425,2019-06-03T03:05:58.416700,Conchita,<https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5/search?query=decorator>
2425,2019-06-03T04:56:41.418800,Rikki,"<@Leora> <https://github.com/dkraczkowski/opyapi> I am building my library on decorators maybe source code can help you a bit <https://github.com/dkraczkowski/opyapi>, check `annotations` section and `examples` for example usage"
2426,2019-06-03T04:45:46.417500,Viviana,Yes can you explain what data you want to multiply row or column or full csv file ??

   spamwriter.writerow([‘Spam’, ‘Lovely Spam’, ‘Wonderful Spam’])"
2430,2019-06-03T09:53:11.438400,Ashley,"That this reads the file one line at a time, so it's best to read from one file, then write to a different, and then just rename the new file once it's finished"
2430,2019-06-03T09:53:40.438800,Ashley,That's how it writes one row
2430,2019-06-03T09:53:49.439400,Starla,"ok. i am still bit of lost, if can help with code?"
2430,2019-06-03T09:54:08.440000,Ashley,"It took a list, and then treated each item in that list as one thing to put in that one row"
2430,2019-06-03T09:55:39.442100,Ashley,"So when you look at the last row it would write in the CSV file, it would have this:

```
Spam,Lovely Spam,Wonderful Spam
```"
2430,2019-06-03T09:56:34.442900,Starla,"ok. but then i want repeating my 300 rows , how can i use logic for that?"
2430,2019-06-03T09:56:45.443400,Starla,let’s say filename = file_name
2430,2019-06-03T09:56:48.443600,Ashley,A for loop would handle that fine
2430,2019-06-03T09:57:27.444000,Starla,"someone give me a full logic, please :face_with_rolling_eyes:"
2430,2019-06-03T09:57:36.444300,Ashley,We can't write it for you
2430,2019-06-03T09:58:06.445000,Ashley,"This is <#C07EFMZ1N|help>, not #domyworkforme"
2430,2019-06-03T09:58:21.445400,Ashley,We'll gladly help you along every step of the way though
2430,2019-06-03T09:59:40.446400,Ashley,You have to open a file before you can read/write from/to it
2430,2019-06-03T10:00:25.447400,Ashley,It'll probably be smoother if you have both files open at the same time
2430,2019-06-03T10:00:48.448300,Ashley,So you can have a `with` inside another `with`
2430,2019-06-03T10:00:48.448400,Starla,"I am helping someone to do the work, that;s why, i am beginner at 0.1 level in python yet"
2430,2019-06-03T10:02:09.449400,Ashley,"And that's great, but this is entry level stuff"
2430,2019-06-03T10:02:40.450100,Ashley,So don't worry about it being too difficult
2430,2019-06-03T10:03:03.451300,Ashley,Take it one step at a time
2430,2019-06-03T10:03:07.451400,Starla,"csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ‘, quotechar=‘|')
What does delimiter and quotechar do here?"
2430,2019-06-03T10:03:34.452400,Hiroko,tells you what characte is used for separating out the columns
2430,2019-06-03T10:03:47.453200,Hiroko,"and there’s optional quote characters.  eg, single quote, double quote, etc"
2430,2019-06-03T10:06:48.456800,Starla,ok.
2430,2019-06-03T10:07:51.458800,Starla,"import csv
with open(‘File1.csv’, ‘w’, newline=‘’) as csvfile:
=&gt; This helps me to open File1 &amp; then what is role of “csvfile” ?"
2430,2019-06-03T10:08:15.459800,Hiroko,its a file object
2430,2019-06-03T10:08:21.460200,Starla,means?
2430,2019-06-03T10:09:04.461800,Hiroko,`open` asks the OS to provide a file descriptior to a file to allow read/write access to it
2430,2019-06-03T10:09:32.463000,Hiroko,"question, is this homework?"
2430,2019-06-03T10:10:12.464800,Starla,"it’s small project work for my sis, who asked me help that needs to submit by tomorrow morning."
2430,2019-06-03T10:10:41.465500,Starla,Myself interested in python but i haven’t started learning much yet
2430,2019-06-03T10:10:47.465800,Hiroko,gotcha
2430,2019-06-03T10:11:02.467000,Hiroko,"when you say project for your sister, is this for work or school?"
2430,2019-06-03T10:11:20.467400,Starla,for university
2430,2019-06-03T10:11:54.468400,Starla,"she is in DS major, however she does not have much idea of python"
2430,2019-06-03T10:13:14.471600,Starla,"i don’t mean to give u guys her homework, just she is in the situation can’t seek of much help so reached out to me."
2430,2019-06-03T10:14:28.473800,Starla,"she got her work done through shell script, however she is required to write the same code in python which is she unaware. her homework was to use data to Data Science, which she has done"
2430,2019-06-03T10:14:31.474000,Jimmy,DS ? ok datascience I guess
2430,2019-06-03T10:14:31.474100,Ashley,"To put it another way, `with open` is a context manager, which means that it has control over what happens when you first go into the `with` and also when you finally leave it. In this case, it opens the file, and closes it again when you leave. The `as csvfile` is providing you with a variable name that you can reference the file with. You can put anything you want there. Python doesn't understand that it's a CSV file yet though. It thinks it's just a normal file that happens to have a variable referencing it named ""csvfile"""
2430,2019-06-03T10:15:56.475100,Ashley,"<@Starla> that means this is her homework. In data science, python is the most popular language to use. She needs to learn how to do this herself."
2430,2019-06-03T10:16:50.476100,Starla,"I agree and i will ask her do. in case, part of help if i can offer for now to her, it would be useful"
2430,2019-06-03T10:17:57.477100,Ashley,"It's great that you're trying to help her, but she really needs to learn this herself"
2430,2019-06-03T10:18:33.478800,Ashley,"Have her join, and we'll walk her through just like we were with you"
2430,2019-06-03T10:18:38.479000,Starla,"is there a way that i can use above code to import csv &amp; open file, then use below loop and multiply data?"
2430,2019-06-03T10:18:39.479200,Clemmie,"<@Starla> that's cheating. If she would like to join the slack we would be happy to help her here, but most people will be uncomfortable teaching you so that you can do it for her"
2430,2019-06-03T10:18:39.479300,Starla,"count = 0
while (count &lt; 3):
    count = count + 1"
2430,2019-06-03T10:19:22.479800,Ashley,"A for loop is better, because it can track the iterator for you"
2430,2019-06-03T10:19:33.480200,Ashley,"But again, she needs to learn this herself"
2430,2019-06-03T10:19:35.480400,Starla,"sure. i will ask her join. I joined here firstly for myself learning, still using slack bcz of company use at SAP."
2430,2019-06-03T10:19:48.480900,Ashley,"If you do it for her, you will only be hurting her in the long run"
2430,2019-06-03T10:20:18.481700,Clemmie,"that's great! we'll happily help you on your work, and her on hers!"
2430,2019-06-03T10:20:36.482800,Ashley,"The next assignment will build on this one, and if she doesn't understand how to do this one on her own, she won't be able to complete the next one"
2430,2019-06-03T10:20:39.482900,Starla,"i am interested in learning python actually for my work, just i haven’t started yet. need to push myself through such situation"
2430,2019-06-03T10:20:57.483100,Ashley,That's great!
2430,2019-06-03T10:21:19.483500,Ashley,We'd love to help
2430,2019-06-03T10:21:27.483900,Ashley,Both you _and_ your sister
2430,2019-06-03T10:21:30.484100,Starla,"working on cloud field, it’s good and highly required skill"
2430,2019-06-03T10:21:46.484600,Ashley,Definitely
2430,2019-06-03T10:21:57.484900,Starla,"Yup. and yet, i will ask her, we are not in same place. I am in china and she’s in AU. so can ask her to join later, may be tomorrow"
2430,2019-06-03T10:22:28.485100,Ashley,Sounds good
2430,2019-06-03T10:24:43.485400,Starla,Thanks for u guys help and advice

2431,2019-06-03T10:13:28.471800,Clemmie,So she gave you her homework?
2431,2019-06-03T10:15:24.474700,Deana,"Hey all, looking for some help as I’m kind of at a loss.

I recently was messing around (dumb) with my Python versions with brew, pip, and other tools.
I installed Python 3.7.3 and tried making it my standard Python version (running on MacOS 10.14.5).
Now everytime I run a python script, it hangs and I am forced to cancel out (ctrl+c) and I get these lines of code at the end.

```^CTraceback (most recent call last):
File ""/usr/bin/idle2.7"", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
main()
File ""/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/idlelib/PyShell.py"", line 1613, in main

def __call__(self, *args):
KeyboardInterrupt```

It seems I screwed something up with my Python frameworks while installing and upgrading things.
Would love any advice to resolve this issue. Thanks!"

2432,2019-06-03T11:23:46.001900,Dorothy,<@Deana>  didn't see any answer to your issue.. but from the looks of the traceback.. your python is trying to call python2 an not python3 ??
2432,2019-06-03T11:25:08.002900,Deana,"<@Dorothy> yes, I believe because MacOS runs Python2.7 natively for a lot of system utils… but I still get the same hanging issue when I run a script and explicitly call Python3.7, like I did just now….

2432,2019-06-03T11:28:14.005100,Ashley,<@Deana> you should always operate in a virtual env
2432,2019-06-03T11:28:39.005800,Ashley,it helps with a lot of this
2432,2019-06-03T11:28:41.005900,Deana,<@Ashley> lol yes I did install and start this practice after this headache… and now I feel I’ve created such a mess it’s hard to untangle
2432,2019-06-03T11:29:06.006100,Ashley,shouldn't be too difficult
2432,2019-06-03T11:29:11.006500,Ashley,do you have brew installed?
2432,2019-06-03T11:29:30.006800,Deana,I’m using brew as my package manager
2432,2019-06-03T11:29:34.007000,Ashley,awesome
2432,2019-06-03T11:29:47.007300,Ashley,so you installed python 3 with brew?
2432,2019-06-03T11:30:14.007600,Deana,"yes
```nyb-m-hernandezj:Scripts jovanhernandez$ which python3
/usr/local/bin/python3```"
2432,2019-06-03T11:30:29.008000,Ashley,hmm
2432,2019-06-03T11:30:45.008200,Ashley,"ok, so that should all be good"
2432,2019-06-03T11:31:15.008800,Ashley,"so as long as you reference that when you make a virtual env, you should be fine"
2432,2019-06-03T11:31:46.009300,Ashley,"when the virtual env is active, just make sure you ahve all the resources you need through pip"
2432,2019-06-03T11:31:48.009400,Deana,maybe i need to recreate my virtualenv
2432,2019-06-03T11:31:55.009600,Ashley,that can help sometimes
2432,2019-06-03T11:32:04.009900,Ashley,just make sure that nothing is installed at the system level
2432,2019-06-03T11:32:35.010600,Deana,yea i think thats what the issue is. perhaps I should purge any instance of python3 and then activate virtualenv and install python3 again in the virtualenv?
2432,2019-06-03T11:32:47.010900,Deana,leave python2.7 as the only version of python on the system level?
2432,2019-06-03T11:33:04.011200,Ashley,"no, you'll need python 3 at the system level"
2432,2019-06-03T11:33:22.011500,Ashley,that way you can make a copy of it when you make a python 3 virtual env
2432,2019-06-03T11:33:27.011700,Deana,got it
2432,2019-06-03T11:33:42.012100,Ashley,"however, some stuff may have gotten installed at the system level that shouldn't have"
2432,2019-06-03T11:33:57.012500,Ashley,try running `python3 -m pip freeze`
2432,2019-06-03T11:34:01.012700,Ashley,(without the virtualenv)
2432,2019-06-03T11:34:18.013000,Ashley,and then `python2 -m pip freeze`
2432,2019-06-03T11:34:40.013500,Ashley,these will show you what packages were installed through pip at the system level
2432,2019-06-03T11:34:41.013600,Deana,"I got
```nyb-m-hernandezj:Scripts jovanhernandez$ python2 -m pip freeze
-bash: python2: command not found```"
2432,2019-06-03T11:34:50.014000,Deana,but got a huge output of version when running python3 -m pip freeze
2432,2019-06-03T11:35:06.014300,Ashley,"oh, then just `python`"
2432,2019-06-03T11:35:20.014800,Deana,got it
2432,2019-06-03T11:35:25.015000,Ashley,"and yeah, I would wipe those out with `python3 -m pip uninstall &lt;packages&gt;`"
2432,2019-06-03T11:36:18.016100,Ashley,"`python3 -m` basically says ""evaluate this as though I referenced the next thing as a module within `python3`"""
2432,2019-06-03T11:36:23.016300,Deana,am i replaced `&lt;packages&gt;` with something specific? or can I just * wildcard it
2432,2019-06-03T11:36:36.016500,Ashley,I've never tried `*`
2432,2019-06-03T11:36:42.016700,Ashley,it might work
2432,2019-06-03T11:36:58.017200,Ashley,"but if not, just list all the installed packages"
2432,2019-06-03T11:37:11.017400,Ashley,for python3 that is
2432,2019-06-03T11:37:19.017900,Ashley,you can do the same thing with python 2
2432,2019-06-03T11:37:25.018100,Deana,I have about 30 packages when listed… :sweat_smile:

For example if you have a main async method.

Alternatively, what does the API return regarding comments when they are disabled? :slightly_smiling_face: can't you make a check some how"
2443,2019-06-04T09:41:55.028500,Ashley,The response from the API that you're dealing with is a dict once you've parsed it. You can apply logic to it and anything inside it just like any other form of data
2443,2019-06-04T09:42:26.028700,Ashley,"If there's something in that dict that tells you comments are disabled, you can look at that"

2443,2019-06-04T10:24:35.030200,Christina,"My point was essentially what Salmon explained way better. the 'right way' is just the best way to solve your problem. Whether your solution is sufficient, depends on the problem you are trying to solve. If it is system critical to know whether they are disabled or that no one has commented on it, I would probably investigate how to make sure I got the correct value. if it is less relevant, then your solution seems fine :slightly_smiling_face:"

2446,2019-06-04T11:24:53.034800,Clemmie,a naked one will hide other errors

2446,2019-06-04T11:25:11.035600,Clemmie,I assume it is trying to return that the write happened

2446,2019-06-04T11:25:34.036500,Ashley,"if no error is thrown, then you can assume it worked"
2446,2019-06-04T11:26:14.037100,Clemmie,"but this is correct if you want to capture that logic in one place, and not catch it at the calling location"
2446,2019-06-04T11:28:20.040100,Christina,"but this is deducible from the exception. Python is all about `ask for forgiveness rather than permission` - afaik python is optimized regarding exceptions that you can essentially use them as flags to parse around. but your solution is fine but i would probably add the exception that can be cast by `influx`. This except would also get caught if for instance the system tries to shut down the program gracefully, meaning the program wont shut down but rather tell your system that the db write failed."

2446,2019-06-04T11:35:47.046000,Ashley,"<@Adolfo> I'd guess that you have some flow control where you call that function based on the return value. I might try handling the exception there instead in that function. That way there isn't redundant flow control and it's explicitely stated what's happening at that level and isn't  something like:

```
if self.do_thing():
    mroe stuff
else:
    other stuff

Currently, the IDE for python code is Pycharm and I've installed Appium Studio and Appium Server.  Would anyone know how to integrate appium with Pycharm so I can write my automated tests there while using the inspector in appium to capture the elements ?"

I have a task where I have to send a document for approval. This document is to be sent to the client.

If the approval is done I send the document immediately. The approver has 24 hrs to approve, if he doesn't approve the document is sent automatically. Is there some way I can achieve this in Django.

Now we may have many similar documents lined up. How should I plan events into the future?

Any help will be appreciated."

2450,2019-06-04T16:13:10.054100,Nenita,well im looking over it and getting kinda confused.
2450,2019-06-04T16:13:18.054600,Nenita,i honestly dont know what ot change to fix this
2450,2019-06-04T16:14:27.054900,Holly,are you running a virtual env in pycharm
2450,2019-06-04T16:14:39.055400,Holly,its possible that library is in your virtualenv and not on your base system
2450,2019-06-04T16:14:54.055700,Holly,i.e. if you enter that virtual env from the command line it'd probably work

2450,2019-06-04T16:26:27.058200,Nenita,i just cmd to the directory and type in my py filename
2450,2019-06-04T16:26:40.058400,Ashley,try this instead
2450,2019-06-04T16:26:55.058700,Ashley,`python -m filename`

2450,2019-06-04T16:39:01.060800,Ashley,`CamalCase` is for classes
2450,2019-06-04T16:39:15.061100,Ashley,and mixing them is heresy

2450,2019-06-04T16:47:14.064700,Nenita,"yea, i have hundreds of lines that i will need to re-case, but im just getting this program going for now."
2450,2019-06-04T16:48:53.065300,Ashley,maybe `python -m InvoiceSystem.System_UI.System_GUI`
2450,2019-06-04T16:50:15.065800,Ashley,"also, change the import to be `from .System_UI import SystemFunctions`"
2450,2019-06-04T16:51:10.066200,Nenita,changing my import line to that gives an error
2450,2019-06-04T16:51:19.066500,Nenita,and still getting no module error with the above command

2452,2019-06-04T22:45:36.073600,Hiroko,Or you can do master/feature

2452,2019-06-04T22:48:28.075800,Hiroko,No.  Your primary branch is master and all others branch offa d merge into
2452,2019-06-04T22:49:42.077600,Hiroko,Some workflows have a develop branch which all features branch off and merge into for qa before going to master 
2452,2019-06-04T22:50:10.078800,Hiroko,Or you can just have feature branches off master and merge in when done

this works but with not list:

How would one go about setting up a “production” server for python development?

I mean, how do you avoid problems with different python versions, different libraries, etc

when e.g jenkins build your code on the prod server, how do you make it available to everyone on that server without any library conflicts?"
2461,2019-06-05T11:36:48.126400,Catherina,under which path would these packages be installed to be able to be accessed by everyone?
2461,2019-06-05T11:37:20.126900,Clemmie,"docker, vm, pyenv - various answers for somewhat different use cases"
2461,2019-06-05T11:38:39.127800,Carlo,"yep, asking how a deployment should be done will get you _many_ different answers depending on specific usecases"
2461,2019-06-05T11:39:51.128900,Clemmie,"it also scares me that you are thinking about something being accessible by everyone on a _production_ server. Things should be accessible to _no one_ - only the services provided (db, webserver, etc) should be accessible for their use case"
2461,2019-06-05T11:40:48.129300,Catherina,"What I mean is if I write a python app, it should be able to be executed by anyone"
2462,2019-06-05T11:57:55.131000,Carmen,"The use-case you're talking about is unclear, so we're a bit leery about just giving you an answer and sending you on your way without knowing more of what you're aiming for and why you think everyone needs to execute something your Jenkins server is building."
2462,2019-06-05T11:58:43.132000,Carmen,"For that matter, a Jenkins server shouldn't be building things on a server you're using for active development. It should be building it, storing the artifacts somewhere, and then you pull those artifacts for a deployment to your dev/prod machines."
2462,2019-06-05T12:09:25.133000,Catherina,"I just want to essentially develop stuff -&gt; create a git PR -&gt; have jenkins do some testing -&gt; if all good push the code to a “prod” server, where the end-user can use the app."
2462,2019-06-05T12:09:55.134000,Catherina,My main question here is how do I avoid conflicting libraries etc if I install multiple apps on the same prod server?
2462,2019-06-05T12:10:24.135000,Nenita,<@Ashley> sorry for the late reply. im going to skip this for now because the person who will be using this will have to remote in anyways because of two purchased programs that are needed for pulling qb data and importing it.
2462,2019-06-05T12:10:26.135100,Catherina,"I know about virtual environments, but the user will definetly not know about activating Ves before running scripts etc"
2462,2019-06-05T12:29:07.136900,Ashley,"<@Catherina> there is a difference between writing a library, and providing a service"
2462,2019-06-05T12:29:37.137600,Ashley,"if you are providing a service, then you don't care what environment others have. You control the environment it runs in"
2462,2019-06-05T12:30:21.138500,Ashley,"if you are writing a library, then you can test against multiple python versions you want to support, but it's up to those who want to use it to make sure they're using a supported python version"
2462,2019-06-05T12:30:56.138800,Ashley,python isn't really built for making standalone apps
2462,2019-06-05T12:31:53.139800,Ashley,"it's possible to do this, but not advised, and usually requires you bundling the environment (i.e. python executable, along with the necessary libraries) with it"
2462,2019-06-05T12:32:51.140600,Ashley,"if you're making a library, you can have your CI pipeline build a virtual env for each python version you want to support, and then run the tests inside it"
2462,2019-06-05T12:33:59.141600,Ashley,"if you're making a service, then each ""app"" should be a separate service, ideally running on one or more machines that are dedicated to only running that service"
2462,2019-06-05T12:34:13.141800,Ashley,that way there is no conflicts
2462,2019-06-05T12:34:59.142700,Ashley,"if, for some reason, you need to run it all on the same machine, then either use virtual environments for each ""app"", or containerize them with docker so that each app gets its own container with its own environment"
2462,2019-06-05T12:36:20.144000,Ashley,"if you think that everything needs to be in the same environment, but could somehow still have conflicts, then you have some hyper-coupled systems that you need to break apart anyway, which renders the need for a singular environment moot"
2462,2019-06-05T12:37:33.144600,Ashley,"personally, I recommend docker instead of virtual envs, because that scales up much better and is easier to manage"
2462,2019-06-05T12:37:55.145100,Ashley,"virtual envs are better for local development though, because they take much less time to set up"
2462,2019-06-05T12:38:34.145500,Ashley,"having said that, many people just develop in the containers themselves"
2462,2019-06-05T12:39:15.146200,Ashley,"i.e. they write the code locally, and then use their normal docker file to make a container whenever they want to run the code or run tests against it"
2462,2019-06-05T13:08:56.146700,Catherina,hey <@Ashley> thanks for the write-up
2463,2019-06-05T12:27:50.136200,Ashley,<@Nenita> gotcha
2464,2019-06-05T13:09:22.147300,Catherina,"My intent is not that “complex” to be honest. We are not software developers, but network engineers trying to write scripts"
2464,2019-06-05T13:10:07.148200,Catherina,"If we go the virtual environments route, how exactly would someone sshing into a box know to, for example, enable the virtual environment before using that particular script?"
2464,2019-06-05T13:10:32.148700,Catherina,also how do you automatically put it in the user’s path so he can just call the script without knowing the full path?
2464,2019-06-05T13:11:03.149000,Deana,I could use some help from anyone familiar with `boto3` and AWS
2464,2019-06-05T13:11:12.149100,Leana,"If you have a question, please just ask it. Please do not ask for topic experts;  do not DM or ping random users. We cannot begin to answer a question until we actually get a question. 

<http://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html|*Asking Questions*>"
2464,2019-06-05T13:11:31.149200,Deana,good bot
2464,2019-06-05T13:12:37.150500,Deana,"I have a function with a line that includes `org_client = boto3.client('organizations')` which is supposed to crawl through my Orgs AWS Accounts and list them.

How can I target just one account install of having it start from top level Org.

In theory/my brain tells me `org_client = boto3.client('AWS_Account_ID###')`"
2464,2019-06-05T13:14:17.150700,Clemmie,This might get you a little closer
2464,2019-06-05T13:14:26.151200,Clemmie,sorry about the formatting
2464,2019-06-05T13:15:13.151800,Clemmie,you can see here in the docs that client can actually take a fairly large number of kwargs <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/core/session.html#boto3.session.Session.client>
2464,2019-06-05T13:16:21.152400,Deana,so by specifying the access_key_id and secret_access_key it will point to that specific account vs my entire org?
2464,2019-06-05T13:16:34.153000,Clemmie,"I believe so, yes"
2464,2019-06-05T13:17:11.153800,Deana,"got it, I’ll do some testing, thanks for the pointer"
2464,2019-06-05T13:36:27.154100,Holly,yeah it def should
2465,2019-06-05T14:05:42.154800,Ashley,"<@Catherina> what will these ""scripts"" be doing?"
2465,2019-06-05T14:06:14.155400,Catherina,"access network devices, running commands on them"
2465,2019-06-05T14:06:27.155800,Catherina,returning text-based results
2465,2019-06-05T14:06:38.156100,Ashley,"I'm finding it odd that someone would SSH into a box just to run a script, let alone SSH into a box to run a script that SSH's into a box to run scripts"
2465,2019-06-05T14:07:15.156400,Ashley,that sounds like a recipe for disaster
2465,2019-06-05T14:07:30.156600,Ashley,what is the desired behavior?
2465,2019-06-05T14:08:44.157400,Ashley,there may already be something that does what you want so you don't have to re-invent the wheel
2465,2019-06-05T14:10:50.158800,Ashley,"for example, I could SSH into a box for the purpose of setting up a tunnel to another system and spinning up a privately hosted service there so that I run a test suite against it in an isolated environment"
2465,2019-06-05T14:10:58.159100,Ashley,or I could just use a proper CI/CD pipeline
2465,2019-06-05T14:15:00.159500,Catherina,well these are simple python scripts
2465,2019-06-05T14:15:25.159900,Catherina,Example: <https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm>
2465,2019-06-05T14:16:04.160500,Catherina,NAPALM allows you to interact with network devices to do jinja2-based configurations (as an example)
2465,2019-06-05T14:16:35.161200,Catherina,"My concern is what happens when I need both app X and Y, yet they have different library dependencies"
2465,2019-06-05T14:16:49.161700,Catherina,e.g on needs lxml&gt;=1 and the other lxml&lt;=0.2
2465,2019-06-05T14:17:05.162300,Catherina,How do you handle the conflict?
2465,2019-06-05T14:17:09.162400,Clemmie,if there are dependencies on anything besides the standard lib they are not simple scripts
2465,2019-06-05T14:17:10.162500,Jesusa,V I already answered your question
2465,2019-06-05T14:17:38.162800,Jesusa,None
2465,2019-06-05T14:18:09.163300,Jesusa,the answer is virtualenvironments and everyone will tell you the same thing
2465,2019-06-05T14:18:47.164300,Clemmie,"if you need to insulate your users from the virtual environment stuff, then you need to provide these tool as a service, not “log onto the machine via ssh and run”"
2465,2019-06-05T14:19:25.165500,Jesusa,"no, his question is regarding devs working at his company"
2465,2019-06-05T14:19:45.166400,Clemmie,it is not
2465,2019-06-05T14:20:01.166800,Clemmie,"&gt;My intent is not that “complex” to be honest. We are not software developers, but network engineers trying to write scripts
&gt;If we go the virtual environments route, how exactly would someone sshing into a box know to, for example, enable the virtual environment before using that particular script?
&gt;also how do you automatically put it in the user’s path so he can just call the script without knowing the full path?"
2465,2019-06-05T14:20:24.167900,Jesusa,it is.
2465,2019-06-05T14:20:25.168100,Clemmie,"even though it is internal, these are for internal “users”"
2465,2019-06-05T14:20:40.169000,Jesusa,"devs / network engineers, doesn’t matter"
2465,2019-06-05T14:20:51.169600,Clemmie,who want to be insulated from the need to do anything besides `$ run_script`
2465,2019-06-05T14:21:01.170100,Jesusa,None
2465,2019-06-05T14:21:22.171200,Jesusa,I guarantee you there is no easier way of doing this
2465,2019-06-05T14:21:32.171900,Clemmie,that is a fine answer and I agree with that
2465,2019-06-05T14:21:55.172900,Romaine,"we have tooling where I work written completely in Python that installs via brew or apt that creates a virtual env, but doesn't require the user to have any idea that it uses virtual env or even Python"
2465,2019-06-05T14:22:52.174700,Carlo,"just creating aliases or wrapper scripts to run the script with python within the virtual environment, put in $PATH would work too"
2465,2019-06-05T14:23:43.176700,Clemmie,"ultimately <@Catherina> you have your answer here, in many forms. None of it might be what you want to hear, but all correct and complete"
2465,2019-06-05T14:24:10.177500,Romaine,"mind you, the tooling is also for network security at the hosting provider I work at, and the majority of the scripts its made of was written almost entirely by Network Security Engineers writing Python"
2465,2019-06-05T14:24:59.178700,Clemmie,Agreed. my biggest sticking point on this whole thing is the requirement that Network Engineers not need to understand how to spin up and run a venv
2465,2019-06-05T14:25:35.180000,Clemmie,I would be hiring a new network team if that excuse was given
2465,2019-06-05T14:25:38.180300,Catherina,&gt; who want to be insulated from the need to do anything besides `$ run_script`
2465,2019-06-05T14:25:43.180700,Ashley,network engineers should be able to handle that pretty easily
2465,2019-06-05T14:25:43.180800,Catherina,essentially this ^
2465,2019-06-05T14:26:08.182000,Romaine,"yup! not every Network Engineer wants to learn code, but I am an incredible advocate for the ability to code to be a major part of a Network Engineers profile"
2465,2019-06-05T14:26:09.182100,Ashley,<@Catherina> then you should make a service that they send requests to
2465,2019-06-05T14:26:28.183000,Clemmie,^ if they can’t be trusted to run python correctly
2465,2019-06-05T14:26:41.183500,Ashley,"actually, network engineers still need to learn scripting and understand shell environments very well in order to do their job"
2465,2019-06-05T14:26:56.183900,Romaine,not always <@Ashley>
2465,2019-06-05T14:27:07.184600,Catherina,"Anyway I see what you guys mean. Now it’s just a matter of figuring out how to apply this. I’ve worked in Amazon where we had these boxes were all our tools would get deployed to, everything would be in your path once you ssh into the box."
2465,2019-06-05T14:27:10.184800,Romaine,but the most successful Network Engineers should know code
2465,2019-06-05T14:27:15.185000,Catherina,With no knowledge of virtual envs etc
2465,2019-06-05T14:27:28.185600,Catherina,"just want to replicate that, but unsure how they set it up"
2465,2019-06-05T14:28:08.186600,Ashley,"if they're newbies, I would not expect them to have that level of knowledge, but virtual environments literally just manipulate the $PATH variable, and if they didn't understand how that worked, that would raise several red flags"
2465,2019-06-05T14:28:13.186800,Jesusa,they probably did exactly what I told you to do
2465,2019-06-05T14:28:27.187100,Jesusa,virtualenvs do not just manipulate $PATH
2465,2019-06-05T14:28:39.187400,Jesusa,there’s a ton of stuff going on
2465,2019-06-05T14:29:04.188200,Ashley,"kind of. they make a duplicate install of python, and then manipulate the $PATH to point to that install"
2465,2019-06-05T14:29:09.188400,Clemmie,"as a shorthand, yes that is what they do"
2465,2019-06-05T14:29:24.188800,Ashley,"technically, it doesn't even have to be an install of python"
2465,2019-06-05T14:29:45.189600,Catherina,thanks <@Jesusa>
2465,2019-06-05T14:29:47.189800,Catherina,and others
2465,2019-06-05T14:29:59.190200,Catherina,I’ll try to figure out how to make this work in practice
2465,2019-06-05T14:30:03.190300,Ashley,"it's just an alternate bin, include, and lib folder"
2465,2019-06-05T14:30:23.190700,Jesusa,"symlinks, not copies"
2465,2019-06-05T14:31:01.191300,Ashley,"nah, it's a copy"
2465,2019-06-05T14:31:09.191600,Clemmie,I’ve never heard of it being a symlink
2465,2019-06-05T14:31:11.191800,Clemmie,it is a copy
2465,2019-06-05T14:31:27.192400,Ashley,"there's symlinks in there, but they just point back to the copy of python"
2465,2019-06-05T14:31:39.192700,Ashley,i.e.
2465,2019-06-05T14:31:44.192900,Ashley,"```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 nejame nejame       9 Mar 14 12:07 python -&gt; python3.7

```"
2465,2019-06-05T14:32:44.194100,Romaine,"we have CCIEs where I work that do not know code, and it makes me lose respect for them, even with the power that cert holds"
2465,2019-06-05T14:33:38.195600,Catherina,CCIE != coding
2465,2019-06-05T14:33:40.195700,Romaine,"at that point in a Network Engineers career, they should be talking about forward progress, and networks configured mostly by hand in any scope is a liability"
2465,2019-06-05T14:33:56.196100,Catherina,I am a CCIE but coding is different.
2465,2019-06-05T14:34:35.197300,Ashley,that blows my mind
2465,2019-06-05T14:34:46.197700,Ashley,<@Catherina> do you know how the `$PATH` variable works?
2465,2019-06-05T14:35:27.198400,Catherina,I do.
2465,2019-06-05T14:35:29.198700,Ashley,ok
2465,2019-06-05T14:35:36.199000,Ashley,then you're fine
2465,2019-06-05T14:35:38.199200,Romaine,"congrats on that, and I respect you immensely for that cert, but if you are not doing anything to further the future of Network Engineering, then all I can say is that you would be worth even more with more knowledge in Code/Automation"
2465,2019-06-05T14:35:54.199800,Ashley,I would be amazed if you didn't
2465,2019-06-05T14:35:57.200000,Romaine,me too
2465,2019-06-05T14:36:11.200700,Jesusa,None
2465,2019-06-05T14:36:14.201200,Romaine,"but like I said, I know a few CCIE who don't and don't think its important at all"
2465,2019-06-05T14:36:16.201300,Jesusa,default symlinks unless `nt`
2465,2019-06-05T14:36:34.201800,Jesusa,"looks like the primary interpreter is a copy though, depends on the version however"
2465,2019-06-05T14:38:50.203600,Ashley,"I'm not saying you need to know python to be CCIE, but you should know how to write a script, and understand the shell well enough to know how $PATH works"
2465,2019-06-05T14:39:27.204100,Ashley,you'd have to go to some extreme lengths to avoid that information when getting the CCIE cert
2465,2019-06-05T14:40:24.204300,Romaine,agreed
2465,2019-06-05T14:42:26.205600,Catherina,"Oh, of course :thumbsup:"
2465,2019-06-05T14:42:28.205900,Clemmie,<@Jesusa> where did you find that code?
2465,2019-06-05T14:42:35.206200,Clemmie,"Not arguing, just interested"
2465,2019-06-05T14:42:40.206500,Jesusa,<https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>
2465,2019-06-05T14:42:41.206600,Catherina,What I’m talking about here is how to setup a dev/qa/prod environment
2465,2019-06-05T14:42:43.206900,Jesusa,the official package
2465,2019-06-05T14:42:56.207200,Catherina,something I never had to do in Amazon because it was all already there
2465,2019-06-05T14:43:00.207400,Catherina,:cold_sweat:
2465,2019-06-05T14:43:13.207900,Jesusa,they’re hinting symlinks should be the default
2465,2019-06-05T14:43:35.208800,Ashley,<@Jesusa> that just suggests that `nt` is the primary exception
2465,2019-06-05T14:43:38.209000,Ashley,not the default
2465,2019-06-05T14:44:27.210000,Ashley,ah sorry I misread
2465,2019-06-05T14:44:57.210600,Jesusa,symlinks on mine
2465,2019-06-05T14:44:57.210700,Jesusa,None
2465,2019-06-05T14:44:59.211100,Clemmie,Interesting. Historically (pre-venv) it was not. I don’t feel strongly one way or another. Also that flag help is atrocious “use symlinks if this wouldn’t by default. Where would it by default? who knows!”
2465,2019-06-05T14:45:24.211600,Clemmie,I’m torn on the idea
2465,2019-06-05T14:45:32.211800,Jesusa,I don’t care either way

2465,2019-06-05T14:45:59.212800,Clemmie,dirties up /usr/local though
2465,2019-06-05T14:46:10.213100,Clemmie,"eh, I use containers, so it doesn’t matter"
2465,2019-06-05T14:46:53.213300,Ashley,oh wait
2465,2019-06-05T14:46:57.213500,Ashley,we're reading it backwards
2465,2019-06-05T14:47:27.213900,Ashley,ah nevermind
2465,2019-06-05T14:47:35.214300,Ashley,I think I've read it assbackwards
2465,2019-06-05T14:47:50.214700,Clemmie,"venv will default to symlinks for the main python interpreter, unless it is on `nt`, unless you use the `--use-symlinks` flag"
2465,2019-06-05T14:48:02.215200,Ashley,yeah
2465,2019-06-05T14:48:05.215400,Ashley,one sec
2465,2019-06-05T14:48:05.215500,Clemmie,so that flag is (current;y) only meaningful on nt
2465,2019-06-05T14:48:09.215700,Ashley,trying with pure venv
2465,2019-06-05T14:48:16.216000,Clemmie,that is pure venv
2465,2019-06-05T14:48:32.216300,Clemmie,virtualenv is different
2465,2019-06-05T14:49:53.216500,Ashley,yeah
2465,2019-06-05T14:50:06.216800,Ashley,the one I pulled from earlier was made with something else
2465,2019-06-05T14:50:17.217100,Ashley,so I wanted to try again with the pure venv
2465,2019-06-05T14:50:21.217300,Ashley,and I stand corrected
2465,2019-06-05T14:50:37.217500,Ashley,"but yeah, that irks me"
2465,2019-06-05T14:51:00.218000,Ashley,the point of the venv is to avoid conflicts with the system level install as well as other installs
2465,2019-06-05T14:51:20.218400,Ashley,upgrading the system level install could break the venv
2465,2019-06-05T14:52:12.218800,Ashley,<@Jesusa> :taco:
2465,2019-06-05T14:53:04.219100,Ashley,what's up with `nt` though?
2465,2019-06-05T14:54:09.219300,Hiroko,"windows, I think"
2465,2019-06-05T14:54:24.219600,Hiroko,specifically windows NT versions
2465,2019-06-05T14:57:42.220000,Hiroko,comes from this:  <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/sysmodule.c#L1957-L1982>
2465,2019-06-05T14:57:47.220300,Hiroko,either `posix` or `nt`
2465,2019-06-05T14:58:16.220500,Hiroko,<https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/os.py#L6>
2465,2019-06-05T15:05:10.221700,Jesusa,<@Ashley> How is a copy of an interpreter different from a symlink?
2465,2019-06-05T15:06:07.222000,Holly,symlink goes to the location you have it pointed to
2465,2019-06-05T15:06:48.223300,Clemmie,"for tooling that have to have know, pinned versions, that is not great"
2465,2019-06-05T15:08:22.226600,Jesusa,that’s the equivalent of saying “you shouldn’t symlink openssh” because anyone should be able to swap the binary in /usr/bin
2465,2019-06-05T15:08:42.227300,Jesusa,but they’re keeping ruby? <@Hiroko>
2465,2019-06-05T15:08:59.228000,Hiroko,<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos_release_notes/macos_10_15_beta_release_notes>
2465,2019-06-05T15:09:18.228500,Hiroko,"&gt;&gt;&gt;• Scripting language runtimes such as Python, Ruby, and Perl are included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS won’t include scripting language runtimes by default, and might require you to install additional packages. If your software depends on scripting languages, it’s recommended that you bundle the runtime within the app. (49764202)

• Use of Python 2.7 isn’t recommended as this version is included in macOS for compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS won’t include Python 2.7. Instead, it’s recommended that you run python3 from within Terminal. (51097165)"
2465,2019-06-05T15:10:02.230100,Clemmie,"if I had a contract/regulation, say in healthcare, where all versions needed to be pinned and had catastrophic regulatory penalties if it changed without approval, you would be sure I am copying and not symlinking openssh too"
2465,2019-06-05T15:10:44.231600,Jesusa,"If I had a contract/regulation I would ensure the binaries have only executable permissions, and that’s it"
2465,2019-06-05T15:12:01.233700,Clemmie,<@Mariah> I would look to see if the external app had an api to use
2465,2019-06-05T15:26:22.245700,Ashley,"or, just make it a service for the to query directly"
2465,2019-06-05T15:27:56.248800,Catherina,what I wanted was for something centralized
2465,2019-06-05T16:09:33.261200,Carmen,"<@Catherina> If you're dead set on this particular implementation path, I would recommend that you have your Jenkins server package up the virtualenv along with the script so that it's all one artifact. Then you deploy that artifact to your servers, along with a wrapper script that activates the virtualenv and runs the actual script. Drop a symlink to that wrapper script in `/usr/bin` and make it executable by the users who should be allowed to run it."
2465,2019-06-05T16:10:30.262100,Carmen,"That keeps your dependencies contained within the virtualenv, and your users are insulated from anything related to the virtualenv because they're just calling the wrapper script."
2466,2019-06-05T15:01:43.221200,Carmon,what up
2466,2019-06-05T15:06:16.222400,Holly,a copy is an instance in and of itself separate from the other
2466,2019-06-05T15:06:25.222700,Clemmie,if you change what is at the linked location - :fireworks:
2466,2019-06-05T15:06:54.223600,Jesusa,"nothing should change the system python, ever"
2466,2019-06-05T15:06:59.223800,Jesusa,this is by design
2466,2019-06-05T15:07:20.224400,Jesusa,otherwise bad things start to happen in *NIX land
2466,2019-06-05T15:07:22.224500,Clemmie,no system has 3.7 as the default yet
2466,2019-06-05T15:07:32.224800,Clemmie,so you are linkeng to an installed 3.7
2466,2019-06-05T15:08:07.226000,Clemmie,which could be fine. But maybe there is a 3.7.1 bug fix - most would install it where 3.7 is. but that might break a contract with the app that is using 3.7
2466,2019-06-05T15:08:24.226800,Hiroko,"also, yesterday, Apple stated they were removing system python by default in futhre releases of OSX"
2466,2019-06-05T15:08:46.227700,Hiroko,:nope:
2466,2019-06-05T15:08:50.227800,Clemmie,nope - removing all scripting languages
2466,2019-06-05T15:10:48.231800,Clemmie,that is why we use docker with versy specific release version identifications
2466,2019-06-05T15:11:13.232400,Jesusa,docker is not invulnenable to this
2466,2019-06-05T15:11:21.232700,Clemmie,not invulnerable no
2466,2019-06-05T15:11:28.233300,Clemmie,layered approach
2466,2019-06-05T15:14:18.234900,Clemmie,"What I am saying is that a scraper to parse the html and then compare the widget every second is a little heavy. If there was an api where you could pull the last_changed of a widget, you could poll that"
2466,2019-06-05T15:14:34.235300,Clemmie,"If you get into running a lot of these, every second, you will end up with a backed up queue"
2466,2019-06-05T15:15:01.235800,Jesusa,why do you need to parse the html? just check the site’s checksum before parsing
2466,2019-06-05T15:15:37.236600,Jesusa,I ran the scraper fleet for <http://quandl.com|quandl.com> this works nicely
2466,2019-06-05T15:15:46.236900,Jesusa,"in fact, there’s a specific http request to get the checksum"
2466,2019-06-05T15:16:30.237100,Mariah,how do i get the checksum?
2466,2019-06-05T15:16:40.237300,Jesusa,I did this a long time ago
2466,2019-06-05T15:16:42.237500,Mariah,I agree. A webhook would be ideal but not all platforms have this
2466,2019-06-05T15:17:00.237700,Jesusa,`HEAD` will work
2466,2019-06-05T15:17:04.237900,Jesusa,if they’re fully REST compliant
2466,2019-06-05T15:17:12.238100,Jesusa,you might be able to just get the Last-Modified field
2466,2019-06-05T15:17:28.238300,Clemmie,"absolutely. your polling idea has a good core, I would just be aware of the cases where it might break sown"
2466,2019-06-05T15:17:43.238800,Jesusa,else just `hash()` the request content
2466,2019-06-05T15:17:55.239400,Catherina,but in a more robust way?
2466,2019-06-05T15:18:20.240100,Jesusa,<@Catherina> you could just alias `python` to something else
2466,2019-06-05T15:18:26.240300,Jesusa,but this is all super fragile
2466,2019-06-05T15:18:42.240500,Jesusa,hash is super fast and is probably more reliable than that.
2466,2019-06-05T15:20:21.241600,Ashley,"sorry, I meant why did it get special treatment"
2466,2019-06-05T15:21:32.243100,Clemmie,"<@Catherina> you would be better off writing a quick howto document for your scripts - spin up the env, run. If they depend on a python package that is not in the standard python install you can even catch the `ImportError` and print the venv startup help text"
2466,2019-06-05T15:23:24.244400,Catherina,Yeah but I want people to just be able to ssh into box -&gt; have all scripts in user’s $PATh
2466,2019-06-05T15:23:49.244900,Catherina,"clearly explicitly setting the venv python’s path in the python script is… well, not optimal"
2466,2019-06-05T15:23:57.245200,Catherina,but not sure what are better alternatives
2466,2019-06-05T15:25:43.245300,Ashley,"<@Catherina> I agree with <@Clemmie>. if they are SSH'ing into the box and calling the script, then they can read the `README`."
2466,2019-06-05T15:27:09.246700,Clemmie,we’re having a little trouble helping because you are really forcing a square peg into a round hole
2466,2019-06-05T15:27:17.247000,Catherina,ok… but the readme-route how does that fit into the dev/qa/prod setup? At that point there’d be no need for a “prod” server
2466,2019-06-05T15:27:30.247500,Catherina,each user would just build his own
2466,2019-06-05T15:27:34.247900,Catherina,via the readme
2466,2019-06-05T15:28:17.249700,Arcelia,"Anyone familiar with the pywin32 wrapper? I am having a bit of a challenge with FindWindow, definitely sure I have the right title, found it using EnumWindows"
2466,2019-06-05T15:28:21.249900,Clemmie,"depends - if these access other, more locked down machines for networking then I would have an ip whitelist on the other machines, only accessible from your control machine"
2466,2019-06-05T15:51:40.252500,Jesusa,I would just have a jumpbox with a firewall or ingress rules
2467,2019-06-05T15:11:24.233100,Mariah,"Hi folks, have question regarding polling best practices. I have a Python/flask app that needs to request data from an external server (for example: Instagram). The intention is to check it regularly for changes. I was thinking of just making a simple beautifulsoup scraper, logging the most recent post and comparing the new one to the saved one in the DB. This comparison request -&gt; compare script would be executed by a cronjob say every 1 second. Is there a better approach?"
2467,2019-06-05T15:12:49.233900,Mariah,"Hi, the resource isnt what im worried about, its the polling approach."
2468,2019-06-05T15:17:49.239100,Catherina,"Hey guys, anyone knows how to do this <https://stackoverflow.com/a/23069201/9456478>"
2469,2019-06-05T16:40:22.263100,Jesusa,that’s… a lot of work
2469,2019-06-05T16:40:25.263300,Jesusa,for a network guy
2469,2019-06-05T16:49:24.264800,Jesusa,if people are going to do `python /path/to/my/script` you could just alias python to activate the virtualenv ahead of time
2469,2019-06-05T16:50:03.265700,Letty,"<@Catherina> If you make your scripts part of a python package and install them into a virtualenv, then they’ll show up inside that virtualenv’s bin directory. You can then symlink those files from anywhere (/usr/bin etc) and they’ll run inside the virtualenv. <https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html>"
2469,2019-06-05T16:51:34.266200,Letty,"(which is roughly the “wrapper script” idea, but the wrapper part itself is handled by virtualenv)"
2469,2019-06-05T16:52:17.266400,Catherina,:thinking_face:
2469,2019-06-05T16:54:47.267400,Letty,"This is maybe surprising behavior, but it is documented:
&gt; However, all scripts installed in a virtual environment should be runnable without activating it, and run with the virtual environment’s Python automatically.
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>"
2469,2019-06-05T16:58:19.268300,Catherina,So <@Letty> how is this more robust than adding the venv’s python path in my `#!`?
2469,2019-06-05T16:58:37.268500,Catherina,For every script
2469,2019-06-05T16:58:44.268700,Catherina,Is it actually better?
2469,2019-06-05T17:07:32.270800,Layla,"I have a command line python module. If I send a ctrl+c event  then I need to reset terminal. If I let it finish I don't need to reset terminal.

I can input commands, but they just don't appear on the command line. I think I've traced the issue to be caused by:   `proc = Popen(commands, stdout=PIPE)`"
2469,2019-06-05T17:41:15.271500,Letty,"It’s effectively doing the same thing, but with the advantage that the `venv` module itself is building the wrapper. There’s a decent chance your way of adding the venv’s python to your `#!` line has a subtle bug with environments, while the using the stdlib’s version is more likely to get it correct (and maintain the it moving forward).

Not a huge plus, but it’s always good to use something directly supported instead of rolling your own."
2470,2019-06-05T17:18:32.271400,Layla,"I think what's happening is I'm piping the stdout, and catching a signal at this point doesn't allow me to stop piping out."
2470,2019-06-05T20:07:45.275800,Layla,"I think my problem is I'm capturing the stdout while using GDB, and when the signal is caught by the process I'm always at `proc.wait()` so the stdout is still being sent to a pipe"
2471,2019-06-05T19:52:37.273100,Bethany,Is the signal in the python code?
2471,2019-06-05T19:53:28.274200,Bethany,"Can you capture the stdout then print in Python, and use your logic there?"
2471,2019-06-05T20:24:13.276300,Bethany,Oh so the subrocess is the one that receives the signal?
2472,2019-06-05T20:28:45.276500,Shirley,"hey all - hoping to get some help with a django/celery/mysql issue:
I have a django api miner that runs through celery to queue and run the jobs, in which I use django-celery-results with to check the status of jobs; this whole setup is running in docker linux containers.
When a job returns a larger data set, I keep getting a `mysql has gone away` error: <https://bpaste.net/show/cc6cb279f629>
I tried adjusting the batch size per the django docs to create limited amount of records at a time, but that seems to have no effect.
I tried using a `django.db.close_old_connections()` on each time the job stores data, but that also did not have any effect.
my celery settings are: <https://bpaste.net/show/724d1cc516e8>

any idea what may be causing this issue?"
2472,2019-06-05T20:32:49.277700,Hiroko,Usually this is because you’re operating on the same db connection that you established at the start of the task 
2472,2019-06-05T20:36:22.279400,Shirley,"the `get` and `store` methods are part of the same class, however the store method which touches the models, is not called until after the `get` method has returned results."
2472,2019-06-05T20:38:02.281100,Shirley,(just verified) the class is re-initialized with each job call; so in theory the store method should be closing it's connection?
2472,2019-06-05T20:38:45.281600,Hiroko,Not if you’re using the same queryset 
2472,2019-06-05T20:40:30.282000,Shirley,so django would be keeping it open in anticipation of additional calls?
2472,2019-06-05T20:41:18.282700,Hiroko,What’s your code?

2472,2019-06-05T20:47:56.285300,Hiroko,I assume this returns a Django queryset?
2472,2019-06-05T20:48:16.285900,Hiroko,Or something from `values`?
2472,2019-06-05T20:48:49.286500,Shirley,that is just a call to a method that executes the API call using the Google Analytics python lib <https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/rest/>
2472,2019-06-05T20:49:58.287600,Shirley,"it creates an authentication using secret key from a json file, makes the http call and returns the results"
2472,2019-06-05T20:50:05.287900,Shirley,it doesn't touch any django models at all

At this point I def think this is a bug of django-celery-task, as somewhere it is keeping connections open for too long, which is causing the failure.
I will try to open a bug on their repo to see what they can find.

Appreciate all your help in troubleshooting it!"

I changed the mysql max_packet_size to 256mb and the issue went away, when is when I discovered that my silent exception handler had some code from debugging, which was dumping the full data set into the log, which celery-results was trying to pass into mysql in one go."

2475,2019-06-06T05:42:28.313300,Javier,why isn't the sort working?
2475,2019-06-06T05:49:09.313700,Guillermina,what's `item` - can it be sorted with sort? maybe you need to give sort more info e.g. using `self.slots.sort(key=some_function_to_sort_by)`
2475,2019-06-06T05:49:44.313900,Javier,Item is just something that gets appended to self.slots. I'm not sorting item here right?
2475,2019-06-06T05:49:55.314100,Rubie,Is it a number?

2475,2019-06-06T05:51:43.315100,Javier,"It wouldn't be so frustrating if there were literally any output at all. The error message I have is `bummer: hmmm, the itmes don't seem to be sorted`. What kind of error is that!?"

2475,2019-06-06T05:52:55.315700,Javier,I don't see any output at all
2475,2019-06-06T05:53:52.316000,Javier,assuming self.slots is a list then it should be sorted as is right?
2475,2019-06-06T05:54:19.316200,Rubie,append will add item to the last index
2475,2019-06-06T05:55:29.316400,Javier,yeah and then calling sort on the list after it sorts it right?
2475,2019-06-06T05:55:42.316600,Javier,the line below should be sorting the entire list
2475,2019-06-06T05:56:53.316800,Rubie,"Yeah but thats only if list is [3, 2, 1], if your appending item which is str ['asd', 'ert', 'cvb'] it wouldnt, like seb said depends what `item` is"
2475,2019-06-06T05:57:47.317000,Javier,Let me check that. I'm almost 100% certain that what you said is wrong because sort works based on unicode for each character

2480,2019-06-06T12:33:24.363100,Raguel,"```
x = 5

def f():
    return x*5

def f(x):
    return x*5
```
if i have a variable defined outside, should I put it explicitly in function argument or let it be like that?"
2480,2019-06-06T12:35:02.364200,Raguel,assuming it will be accessed by many other functions too
2480,2019-06-06T12:35:29.364700,Romaine,"in the second function, x is overridden by the variable requirement on the call"
2480,2019-06-06T12:35:44.365000,Romaine,"to combine them, you need to use a different variable"
2480,2019-06-06T12:36:06.365600,Raguel,"oh yeah, forgot scoping rule here"
2480,2019-06-06T12:36:36.366400,Romaine,"```x = 5

def f(x2=None):
    if x2:
        return x2 * 5

    return x * 5```"
2480,2019-06-06T12:37:03.366900,Romaine,it would be wise to do some validation on `x2` but thats the basic premise
2480,2019-06-06T12:37:59.368300,Romaine,but you could also let Exception do its job in this case... it really depends
2480,2019-06-06T12:38:04.368400,Raguel,"yup, makes sense. in my case i need that outside variable to be accessed by all functions so I think it would be better to not pass it as argument to avoid it all"
2480,2019-06-06T12:38:13.368800,Raguel,"yeah, or exception"
2480,2019-06-06T12:38:27.369100,Romaine,"when you start working in that territory, I recommend using Classes"
2480,2019-06-06T12:41:34.369600,Romaine,"```class F:
	x = 5

	def f(self, x=None):
		if x:
			return x * 5

		return self.x * 5


f = F()
f.x = 44
f.f()```"
2480,2019-06-06T12:43:03.370400,Raguel,on it now -- have been avoiding classes for no reason lol. thanks <@Romaine> :taco:
2480,2019-06-06T12:44:02.370700,Romaine,"np! once you go classes, you never go back"
2480,2019-06-06T12:48:27.372400,Holly,"I'll write a script for something, and as soon as I see another use for it I convert it into a class"
2480,2019-06-06T12:49:15.373100,Romaine,its the best way to have multiple versions of your script isolated from each other in the same python instance!
2480,2019-06-06T12:49:57.373600,Romaine,"functions provide a little bit of isolation, but its not their purpose"
2480,2019-06-06T12:50:15.374300,Romaine,classes organize and isolate your code to its specific needs
2480,2019-06-06T12:51:16.375900,Romaine,"with that same example class: you can do:
```a = F()
b = F()
a.x = 25
b.x = 125
a.f()
b.f()```"
2480,2019-06-06T12:51:23.376100,Raguel,"I think I have a mental block when it comes to classes -- I am like that function is getting work done, and though class could do better, I end up choosing former."
2480,2019-06-06T12:51:41.376900,Romaine,and they have different trackable outcomes
2480,2019-06-06T12:51:50.377100,Raguel,"true, now that you have mentioned it and when I am reading my code again, it totally makes sense to put into classes"
2480,2019-06-06T12:54:40.378100,Clemmie,<@Raguel> one change for that logic - `if x:` should be `if x is not None:` `0` evaluates as false
2480,2019-06-06T12:55:36.379000,Clemmie,"also you may or may not care about making sure that x is a numeric. `'a'*5, []*5` is all valid python"
2481,2019-06-06T12:48:09.372000,Holly,^
2482,2019-06-06T13:30:46.379100,Porsche,Thank you 
2483,2019-06-06T13:43:06.379500,Pura,Can anyone recommend a task queue framework/library
2483,2019-06-06T13:44:34.379700,Hiroko,"celery, redis-queue"
2483,2019-06-06T13:46:40.379800,Pura,"i have come across  these 2, do you have a preference?"
2483,2019-06-06T13:48:37.380000,Clemmie,"celery has a steeper learning curve, but is better documented and more fully featured"
2483,2019-06-06T13:49:54.380200,Clemmie,"one time I used rq because I didn't want the ""weight"" of celery (and I was experienced with celery). Ultimately switched because getting rq to do what I needed ended up needing several more packages, and figuring out the missing documentation bits"
2483,2019-06-06T13:59:09.382600,Hassie,"I was doing like this to see user details

2483,2019-06-06T13:59:49.383600,Hassie,I have no idea. pleas help me
2483,2019-06-06T14:00:09.384100,Clemmie,you almost certainly want `pk=` not `id=`
2483,2019-06-06T14:00:37.384800,Clemmie,you might also want to use a `get_or_404` instead of a `try/except`
2483,2019-06-06T14:02:00.386500,Clemmie,"also, if that is your code and you didn’t retype it, you are missing a `)` at the end of the first return and `:` after except (though the except should be `except User.DoesNotExist:`)"
2483,2019-06-06T14:02:00.386600,Hassie,except is `except User.DoesNotExist`
2483,2019-06-06T14:02:53.387500,Hassie,"I retyped to ask, that's why I missed."
2483,2019-06-06T14:03:01.387800,Pura,Thanks i was initially thinking of apache-airflow but this does not seem to be a good fit for a task queue... Its more a work scheduler right?
2483,2019-06-06T14:03:10.388100,Hassie,but it's not working with `pk` too
2483,2019-06-06T14:03:39.388500,Pura,I am trying to build some etl pipeline which can be ran from an api endpoint.
2483,2019-06-06T14:03:39.388700,Clemmie,are your user id/pks numbers or uuids?
2483,2019-06-06T14:03:56.389000,Hassie,pk is uuid
2483,2019-06-06T14:04:30.389400,Clemmie,for some reason your validator is expecting an integer
2483,2019-06-06T14:05:32.390000,Hiroko,is this django or rest-framework?
2483,2019-06-06T14:05:43.390200,Hassie,django
2483,2019-06-06T14:05:57.390400,Hiroko,are you doing form validation?
2483,2019-06-06T14:06:06.390600,Hiroko,"eg, is this a modelform?"
2483,2019-06-06T14:06:18.391000,Hassie,"Yes, a form"
2483,2019-06-06T14:10:15.391100,Pura,"I have the following usecase.

Someone makes a request to an endpoint passing in a user_name.

It should then begin doing the following work. One after the other.

1st stage fetches data from various sources which takes a long time.

2nd stage then fetches some other data based on the data received in the first fetch.

3rd stage then analyses the data.

is celery a good usecase for this <@Clemmie> <@Hiroko>"
2483,2019-06-06T14:12:20.391800,Romaine,good catch on `if x is not None:` `0` <@Clemmie> :smile:
2483,2019-06-06T14:14:05.392100,Clemmie,yup
2483,2019-06-06T14:18:02.394700,Carlo,<https://stackoverflow.com/a/10288256>
2483,2019-06-06T14:18:13.395500,Carlo,"basically right now, your function is not returning anything"
2483,2019-06-06T14:18:40.396000,Clemmie,the end of the first stage triggers the start ogf the second
2483,2019-06-06T14:19:35.397600,Emelda,So you can't assign a function result before you call it like `$v = get-aduser np12487`
2483,2019-06-06T14:19:45.397800,Emelda,then doing stuff to `$v`
2483,2019-06-06T14:20:26.398000,Carlo,hmm not sure I follow your question
2483,2019-06-06T14:20:53.398500,Hiroko,"well, you can do `user = add_user(some_search_term)`"
2483,2019-06-06T14:20:54.398600,Pura,"right, that makes sense"
2483,2019-06-06T14:21:03.399000,Emelda,bu tthen user is null if I do that
2483,2019-06-06T14:21:11.399200,Hiroko,not if you return the user
2483,2019-06-06T14:21:29.399700,Hiroko,you need to explicitly return anything from a method if you want the thing used outside it
2483,2019-06-06T14:21:39.399900,Emelda,ahhhh
2483,2019-06-06T14:21:43.400200,Emelda,Intersting
2483,2019-06-06T14:21:48.400300,Hiroko,explicit is better than implicit
2483,2019-06-06T14:22:03.400600,Hiroko,one of the core tenets of the language
2483,2019-06-06T14:22:05.400700,Clemmie,"you could even have a pipeline passed to the steps as a list, where the list ins the function objects to be calles, and each step would pop the top off the list to call the next one, and pass the pipeline list on"
2483,2019-06-06T14:22:19.400900,Clemmie,that allows for dynamic pipelines
2483,2019-06-06T14:22:58.401500,Emelda,can I assign the output to any other value aside from it's return?
2483,2019-06-06T14:23:08.401800,Emelda,or does it have to match the return variable?
2483,2019-06-06T14:23:14.402100,Emelda,or am I thinking about it all wrong
2483,2019-06-06T14:23:15.402200,Hiroko,what do you mean?
2483,2019-06-06T14:23:29.402600,Emelda,My powershell brain thinks about everything as an object
2483,2019-06-06T14:23:40.402800,Hiroko,python is similar
2483,2019-06-06T14:24:18.403500,Emelda,I've been able to use some of the same stuff in python like using `[0]` on a string to get the first letter
2483,2019-06-06T14:24:22.403700,Emelda,like it's an array
2483,2019-06-06T14:24:28.403900,Clemmie,because it is
2483,2019-06-06T14:24:35.404100,Clemmie,"well, a list"
2483,2019-06-06T14:24:45.404500,Emelda,so a string is a list of chars
2483,2019-06-06T14:24:55.404800,Clemmie,the dynamic typing + everything is an object in python allows for some nifty stuff
2483,2019-06-06T14:25:02.405000,Clemmie,"not exactly, no"
2483,2019-06-06T14:25:11.405300,Clemmie,string implements `__iter__`
2483,2019-06-06T14:25:16.405500,Clemmie,so it can be iterated on
2483,2019-06-06T14:26:06.405800,Hiroko,and `__getitem__`
2483,2019-06-06T14:26:06.406000,Hiroko,<https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__>
2483,2019-06-06T14:26:20.406300,Hiroko,"&gt;&gt;&gt;Called to implement evaluation of self[key]. For sequence types, the accepted keys should be integers and slice objects"
2483,2019-06-06T14:26:56.406900,Emelda,what are the __values__ in python compared to powershell?
2483,2019-06-06T14:26:57.407000,Pura,Ye maybe. What tool would you use for this pipeline?
2483,2019-06-06T14:27:06.407300,Emelda,I see those alot
2483,2019-06-06T14:27:21.407500,Clemmie,"I haven’t built one, so I don’t know"
2483,2019-06-06T14:27:30.407900,Clemmie,for a simple pass I would build my own
2483,2019-06-06T14:27:33.408100,Pura,"i think we deffinatly need to make it dynamic, some stages need to be skipped"
2483,2019-06-06T14:27:49.408500,Clemmie,they are called dunder methods - they are special
2483,2019-06-06T14:28:20.409400,Emelda,dunder mifflins?
2483,2019-06-06T14:28:22.409500,Clemmie,"for instance, I can call `len(&lt;thing&gt;)` on any thing that is of a class that implements `__len__`"
2483,2019-06-06T14:28:24.409800,Emelda,XD
2483,2019-06-06T14:28:39.410100,Clemmie,“d”ouble “under”
2483,2019-06-06T14:28:44.410300,Emelda,i see
2483,2019-06-06T14:28:55.410600,Clemmie,things that implement `__iter__` can be iterated
2483,2019-06-06T14:28:57.410800,Clemmie,and so on
2483,2019-06-06T14:29:23.411100,Emelda,what's the __main__ one
2483,2019-06-06T14:29:52.411600,Clemmie,all (i think) the dunders are listed on this page <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html>
2483,2019-06-06T14:30:51.412200,Clemmie,"that means the file was called and run as itself, pretty much <https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html>"
2483,2019-06-06T14:34:53.412900,Emelda,so it seems my function is returning the value twice.
2483,2019-06-06T14:35:04.413300,Clemmie,what function do you have now?
2483,2019-06-06T14:35:10.413500,Emelda,nvm i forgot I put a print in there
2483,2019-06-06T14:35:22.413800,Emelda,I'm so green with this I appologize
2483,2019-06-06T14:35:40.414300,Clemmie,"no worries, it’s what <#C07EFMZ1N|help> is for"
2483,2019-06-06T14:35:45.414600,Clemmie,:rubberduck:
2483,2019-06-06T14:35:48.414700,Emelda,It's taking everything in me to not get mad and fall on posh 6
2483,2019-06-06T14:36:19.415300,Emelda,But I want to be able to have more flexibility cross-platform and python has that
2483,2019-06-06T14:36:30.415500,Emelda,Or seems to anyway
2483,2019-06-06T14:37:26.415700,Pura,apparently you can chain tasks
2483,2019-06-06T14:37:27.415900,Pura,<https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/canvas.html#chains>
2483,2019-06-06T14:40:08.416800,Emelda,One thing I wish I could do was just create Python desktop apps in visual studio with the same drag and drop controls I'd use in c#
2483,2019-06-06T14:40:39.417300,Emelda,there's iron python and all sorts of other things but they look ugly
2483,2019-06-06T14:40:54.417700,Javier,I didn't know super did that
2483,2019-06-06T14:41:02.417900,Emelda,tkinter looks like ass
2483,2019-06-06T14:41:42.418300,Holly,tbh whenever I want to have a visual gui I just run it as a webapp
2483,2019-06-06T14:44:08.419100,Holly,but I also hate making GUIs lol
2483,2019-06-06T14:44:33.419500,Holly,I use flask personally since its a really really simple web framework if you want it to be
2483,2019-06-06T14:44:53.419800,Holly,<http://flask.pocoo.org/>
2483,2019-06-06T14:45:08.420300,Holly,you'd also have to learn a little bit of html (I pretty much only use html because my interfaces aren't customer facing)
2483,2019-06-06T14:45:15.420600,Clemmie,"yeah, the two biggies are flask and django"
2483,2019-06-06T14:45:20.420900,Holly,I'm sure others have different thoughts on interfaces
2483,2019-06-06T14:45:25.421200,Holly,GUIs rather
2483,2019-06-06T14:45:38.421500,Clemmie,"different philosophies, but you build web apps in either"
2483,2019-06-06T14:46:57.422500,Holly,"yup; I personally liked flask for my use case, because its a lot more freeform, and building a project if its really small is a lot easier to get going.  Django is powerful but to me it felt overwhelming with how many pre-populated files and configurations it has from the start"
2483,2019-06-06T14:47:42.423000,Romaine,I like to think that Django is more scalable from the start because of that reason
2483,2019-06-06T14:48:49.424500,Romaine,Django just makes it easier to keep going and keep getting bigger because its built to do so from the start
2483,2019-06-06T14:49:17.425200,Romaine,"and while I tend to prefer Django, I might be a bit biased, and personally, its pretty straight forward"
2483,2019-06-06T14:51:15.426500,Clemmie,"and while is shouldn’t be a deciding factor, the membership of our <#C0LMFRMB5|django> channel is about twice the size of the <#C0LN2AD7T|flask> channel (but they are both in the thousands, so plenty of help in both)"
2483,2019-06-06T14:52:30.426900,Romaine,"lol, true dat"
2483,2019-06-06T14:53:12.427700,Pura,"I pefer aiohttp server for web server now over flask because its asynchronous. If im building a webapp i usually make backend api with a static frontend (react, angular) that makes http requests to the api."
2483,2019-06-06T14:53:38.428200,Holly,"I wanted to go that route Kay, but tbh my javascript skills are pitiful and I really hate trying to learn it lol"
2483,2019-06-06T14:57:42.429800,Pura,<http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/design/>
2483,2019-06-06T14:58:02.430000,Pura,` However Flask is just not designed for large applications or asynchronous servers`
2483,2019-06-06T14:58:24.430300,Pura,"I agree django is to overwhelming so i never used it.

This is why i moved from flask to aiohttp."
2483,2019-06-06T14:58:34.430700,Hiroko,<@Pura> quart is flask + aiohttp

2483,2019-06-06T14:59:51.432300,Hiroko,but don’t discount sync frameworks just because async is the new hotness
2483,2019-06-06T15:00:09.432800,Hiroko,they can still easily handle tens of thousands of requests/minute
2483,2019-06-06T15:10:44.432900,Ashley,that's it's only use

2484,2019-06-06T14:15:39.393700,Emelda,"Hey I'm trying to translate my Powershell knowledge to Python and I've moved into functions now. I'm using PyAD and I've created a get_aduser() function but I want to be able to assign the result to a value to perform actions on and I'm not sure how to do that.
```from pyad import aduser
import pyad

def get_aduser(search):
    user = aduser.ADUser.from_cn(search)
    print(user)
    return```"
2484,2019-06-06T14:17:34.394300,Carlo,"<@Emelda> ok so, powershell has some weird return semantics that you'll have to ""unlearn"" in other languages"

This is where i thought an airflow pipeline dag would be useful."
2484,2019-06-06T14:18:57.396700,Carlo,`return user` is how you'd return the user in your function
2484,2019-06-06T14:19:03.396900,Emelda,ahh
2485,2019-06-06T14:44:01.418700,Holly,its easier to deal with in my opinion
2485,2019-06-06T14:44:07.419000,Emelda,Where is the documentation on that?

2488,2019-06-06T16:15:25.435500,Bart,and where can i find it?

2488,2019-06-06T16:24:12.438300,Freeda,I found playsound will help with the mp3s but can't figure out what would show a png as a window and trigger on-click
2488,2019-06-06T16:26:12.438800,Clemmie,<@Bart> everything for packaging a python project for pypi is here <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/>
2488,2019-06-06T16:31:50.439000,Bart,thanks
2488,2019-06-06T17:37:49.439800,Sasha,<@Freeda> You might look at PyGame... as I recall it's pretty easy to get basic stuff like that going.
2488,2019-06-06T18:22:43.440600,Freeda,"Came across that recently while searching, seems like it would be the best choice. Thanks"
